11 October 2020||GUNTUR,||Jagan complains to CJI against SC judge||In an unprecedented move, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has urged Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde to ensure that the State’s judicial neutrality is maintained. In a letter addressed to Chief Justice Bobde, Mr. Jagan alleged that Supreme Court judge Justice N.V. Ramana had been influencing the sittings of the High Court, including the roster of a few judges and cited instances of how matters important to the opposition Telugu Desam Party had been ‘allocated to a few judges’, along with copies of orders passed in a few matters. He cited the recent order passed by the Chief Justice of the High Court in a writ petition No. 16468 of 2020 filed by former Advocate-General Dammalapati Srinivas, staying investigation in the FIR lodged against Mr. Srinivas and a gag order on the press, against which an SLP was preferred. “While the Supreme Court of India has been steadfast in ensuring no prior restraint on publication by media, a gag order on the media is passed in the above WP. Justice D.V.S.S. Somayajulu passed an interim order on October 16, the very next day of the gag order, staying all further proceedings arising from the Cabinet sub committee report, even after being apprised that the matter is before the Union of India,” Mr. Jagan said. Stating that the beneficiaries of both the judgments of the High Court were clearly the politicians of the TDP, Mr. Jagan said that Justice Ramana was a legal adviser and additional advocate-general in the previous government of the TDP. The Chief Minister said that the State government formed a sub-committee by GO no. 1411 on June 26, 2019, to examine the allegations of unbridled corruption, ruthless exploitation of natural resources, grabbing of lands from small and marginal farmers. After the sub-committee submitted its findings, referring to the amassing of wealth by TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu and others by adopting various illegal means to the Assembly, the government forwarded the report to the Union of India urging for a CBI inquiry. In view of the above, the Chief Minister urged the Chief Justice of India to consider initiating steps to ensure that the State’s judicial neutrality was maintained. Adviser to the Chief Minister Ajeya Kallam told reporters on Saturday night that the State government had submitted all evidences to the Chief Justice of India pertaining to “interference by a sitting Supreme Court judge in matters dealt by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh”. “In larger public interest and in order to put to rest the speculations in a section of media concerning these developments, the government deemed it fit to officially speak on the above to ensure the dignity of all the institutions of the State is preserved. The Government of Andhra Pradesh filed Special Leave Petitions against the orders of Justice D.V.S.S. Somayajulu of the High Court staying all further proceedings of Cabinet Sub-Committee and the order of Chief Justice Jitendra Kumar Maheswari staying investigation and a gag order on the reportage of FIR filed against a former A-G and family members of a sitting SC judge in what is now being referred by Amaravati Land Scam. The government has apprised the recent happenings in the High Court and in particular reference to the intervention of a sitting Supreme Court judge, Justice N.V. Ramana, in the proceedings of the High Court,’’ said Mr. Kallam. Mr. Kallam said that the State government placed all the evidences along with a covering letter written by the Chief Minister to the Chief Justice of India on October 8.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/jagan-complains-to-cji-against-supreme-court-judge/article32824872.ece
11 October 2020||HATHRAS,||Police, media and the spectacle of grief in Boolgarhi||A week after the Hathras victim of alleged gang rape and brutal assault was consigned to flames in the dead of night, the family is struggling to come to terms with the intrusive gaze of the media, changing narratives on the basis of selective leaks, and a formidable security presence in the village. “We have said enough to the government, now justice should be done and we should be allowed to grieve in peace,” said the victim’s aunt, squatting at the door behind which the family shuts itself for several hours during the day. When this correspondent visited Boolgarhi on Thursday, the road to the village was thickly dotted with khaki-clad police personnel. Two mobile lavatories indicated the long hours they had been putting in to secure the village that has seen an unusual rush of political delegations and media teams over the last week. There was an imposing metal detector in the outer courtyard that was bustling with relatives and activists last week. Now, there is a sprawling tent for policemen to rest between their shifts. The narrow lane leading to the residence is also lined with policemen.  A woman police constable holding a heavy register asks visitors to provide their details. There are eight CCTV cameras, multiple LED bulbs, and two “shadows” for each member of the family to ensure their zero movement and that no questions of the media go unnoticed. ‘Not moving court’ An official claimed, “This is what the family and the situation demanded.” As the news of the family approaching the Allahabad High Court against their illegal detention spreads, two woman officers request the father of the victim to come out and record a clarification. Answering in half sentences to leading questions, he says he is satisfied with the security and is not planning to shift out. He denies that he asked anybody to approach the High Court on his behalf. When they leave, he mumbles, “What to say... Every word is accounted for and can be used against us... We are simple people... Is mahaul main suraksha to chahiye , par... (We need security in this atmosphere, but...)”  Meanwhile, impatient crews from the electronic media are looking for ways to swoop on the family, including a “sting” on unsuspecting family members. Behind these “journalists” was an official, doing his own “sting” for “official reasons”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/police-media-and-the-spectacle-of-grief-in-boolgarhi/article32824863.ece

11 October 2020||Kolkata,||Soaring political temperatures, rallies trigger spike in COVID-19 cases||In this past week Kolkata has witnessed more than half a dozen political rallies by the ruling Trinamool Congress, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Left and Congress. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s October 3 rally to protest over the Hathras rape and murder, where she admitted that “community transmission has begun in the State”, was followed by two more rallies on October 7 and October 10 by other Trinamool leaders. Not to be left behind,the BJP led a march to the State Secretariat on October 7 to protest the killing of political workers in the State. The day saw clashes between the police and BJP workers, which triggered another round of protests and a candlelight rally the next day. The Left and Congress party, who claim to provide the “third alternative” in the State held joint rallies on October 3 and October 10 in Kolkata. Both days saw huge gatherings. In almost all these mass mobilisations the norms of physical distancing were violated and hundreds could be seen without masks. Data released from the State Health Department suggests that the State has recorded an average of 3,500 infections and 60 deaths daily over the last few days. Kolkata alone is consistently recording its highest ever daily infections. While doctors and public health professionals are concerned about the impact of the Durga Puja celebrations on the COVID-19 cases, the heightened political activity is resulting in a spike weeks ahead of the festivities. With six months to go for Assembly elections, political observers said “no political party is letting go of any issue or opportunity that can help them get some votes.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/soaring-political-temperatures-rallies-trigger-spike-in-covid-19-cases/article32825100.ece

11 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||‘Maize cultivation not viable in Rabi’||A meeting, presided by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to discuss the viability of maize cultivation in Rabi came to a conclusion that it was impossible for farmers to fetch minimum support price from the crop in Telangana. The situation warranted that only those farmers who were willing to earn however low income could face the risk of cultivating the crop, a release said after the meeting that was attended by Agriculture Minister S. Niranjan Reddy, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, Chief Advisor to government Rajeev Sharma and others. Agricultural experts and officials informed Mr. Rao that it was not at all advisable for farmers to go for maize cultivation in the State in view of adverse conditions in the country for the crop and storage. The policies of Central government saw to it that the maize farmers were not assured of MSP. The policies enabling people to sell and buy agricultural produce anywhere in the country and steep reduction of import duties on produce were the bane of poor farmers. A release said the buffer stock of maize in global market after meeting the consumption levels was 28 crore tonnes. India needed 2.42 lakh crore tonnes of maize for its consumption annually, but the available quantity was 3.53 lakh crore tonnes. In effect, the additional stock available was 1.11 lakh crores tonnes. Another 4.10 lakh crore tonnes of maize produced in Kharif this year will arrive at market yards shortly. It was grown over 2.04 crore acres in the country. Therefore, the country was assured of maize not only for this year but next year, the officials explained Mr. Rao. The situation turned worse with the decision of the Centre to import another five lakh tonnes of maize from other countries. The Centre reduced the import duty on maize from 50 to 35 per cent. On account of just 15 per cent import duty, the maize farmers were pushed to a situation as not to expect MSP. The Agriculture Minister intervened to inform that the agriculture officials held meetings with poultry industry to ensure a reasonable price for maize farmers in these circumstances. However, the feed for chicken was available at very low prices in some states. Hence the poultry industry was not prepared to buy feed from farmers of Telangana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/maize-cultivation-not-viable-in-rabi/article32825564.ece
11 October 2020||New Delhi,||Concerns raised over imports of mountain clothing for Army||With the Army looking to strengthen troops in high altitude areas in eastern Ladakh due to the ongoing stand-off with China, Vice-Chief of the Army Lt. Gen. S.K. Saini on Saturday called for self-reliance in and reducing of imports of special clothing and mountaineering equipment. “A large number of our troops are deployed in super high-altitude areas, where the temperature touches -50° Celsius. However, we are still importing cold weather equipment, mainly due to the lack of viable indigenous solutions,” Lt. Gen. Saini said. A collaborative effort is needed to fulfil the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat, he said at a webinar organised by the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies. Border standoff The Army has been maintaining troops in high altitude areas of Siachen glacier at heights of 20,000 feet for decades. With the ongoing standoff along the disputed border with China, the Army has procured clothing and shelter to house the troops through the winter in Ladakh as there has been no progress in talks for disengagement. Lt. Gen. Saini also highlighted the need for security of defence establishments and vital installations, improvised explosive devices (IED) and drones as major priority areas that need domestic solutions.  IEDS gaining traction Lt. Gen. Saini said IEDs seem to be gaining traction as a favoured tool for terrorists and anti-national elements. “It ends up causing both physical and psychological trauma and seriously impairs readiness, by forcing us to commit scarce resources for our protection,” he said, stressing that technological innovation is the key to combating the threat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/concerns-raised-over-imports-of-mountain-clothing-for-army/article32824865.ece
11 October 2020||Kolkata,||War of words over falling turban||The controversy over a turban of Sikh man falling off during the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP) march earlier this week refused to die down even after West Bengal police said the turban had fallen off “in the scuffle”. On Saturday, BJP leaders raked up the issue afresh and some tweeted visuals of the incident during Thursday’s rally. The BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya raised the issue on Saturday and questioned the silence of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Mr. Vijayvargiya said that the incident amounts to “insult of religious sentiment”. Former governor of Tripura Tathagata Roy, who is seeking to play an active part in West Bengal politics, tweeted videos of the incident and accused the police of “mercilessly beating up and snatching and untying the turban of Sardar Balwinder Singh”. The West Bengal police has denied all these allegations saying it respects all religions. “The officer specifically asked him to put his pagri back before the arrest. The attached photo has been clicked right before he was escorted to the police station. We remain committed to our duty to uphold law and order in the State,” the WB Police said on social media. The police had accused Balwinder Singh of “carrying firearms”. Videos of a firearm recovered from the 43-year-old Mr. Singh during the rally on Thursday were also aired by local television channels. He was arrested on Thursday after recovery of the firearm. “The pagri had fallen off automatically in the scuffle that ensued, without any attempt to do so by our officer (visible in the video attached). It is never our intention to hurt the sentiments of any community,” the police said. Several members of the Sikh community, including cricketer Harbhajan Singh, tweeted, tagging Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, to say, “Please look into the matter. This just isn’t done”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/war-of-words-over-falling-turban/article32825101.ece

11 October 2020||CUDDALORE,||Dalit president forced to sit on floor||The Bhuvanagiri police on Saturday arrested Sinduja, secretary of the Therku Thittai panchayat in the Mel Bhuvanagiri block in Cuddalore, after it emerged that panchayat president Rajeshwari Saravana Kumar, from a Scheduled Caste, was forced to sit on the floor at panchayat meetings. The police also arrested Sugumar, a caste Hindu and member of ward number 6. Superintendent of Police M. Sree Abhinav said Sugumar was arrested after an inquiry. He had also threatened Ms. Saravana Kumar at the panchayat meetings, he said. Ms. Sinduja was earlier suspended by Collector Chandra Sekhar Sakhamuri following an inquiry. A case was booked against Ms. Sinduja and panchayat vice-president Mohan Raj under Section 3 (1) (m) and (r) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Mohan Raj is at large, and the police have launched a search. Ms. Saravana Kumar spoke about the harassment and discrimination she had faced from caste Hindus, including Mohan Raj, after a photo of her sitting on the ground while other members were seated on chairs at a panchayat meeting went viral. The meeting was held in July. Mr. Sakhamuri told The Hindu that the matter was brought to the notice of the administration on Friday. The Therku Thittai panchayat has six ward members, including two belonging to the Adi Dravidar community, while the others are caste Hindus. Alleging that she had been a victim of caste discrimination ever since she was elected as the president in January, Ms. Saravana Kumar said Mr. Mohan Raj and three other ward members did not allow her to function independently. “I was not allowed to hoist the national flag during the Republic Day in January. The panchayat vice-president said his father would hoist the flag instead. He and three other ward members, all caste Hindus, insulted me and forced me and the other Dalit ward member, Suganthi, to sit on the floor at meetings, while the rest sat on chairs,” she said. Ms. Saravana Kumar alleged that she had not been allowed to occupy her seat at the panchayat office. This had happened at the last three meetings, and the reason they had cited was that an adequate number of chairs was not available, she said. In the larger interest of serving the people, she had been bearing with the insult and disrespect. “The situation has now reached a point where continued silence would only strengthen their attitude, and hence I have decided to speak out,” she said. The panchayat meetings were convened only by the vice-president, who maintained that that “I am a woman and know nothing and should remain quiet,” she said. She said he had dared her to lodge a complaint with any authority, including the Collector. “He said the officials would be the least bothered.” A senior official said caste-based discrimination had been prevailing in the panchayat for some time. But he rejected her charge that she was not allowed to hoist the national flag at the Republic Day. “The incident [in which she was forced to sit on the floor] happened a few months ago and the photo surfaced now... We directed the Assistant Director, Panchayats, to conduct an inquiry and lodged a complaint with the police to take action under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,” he said.

11 October 2020||GUWAHATI,||Scientists welcome these winged ‘infiltrators’||Unlike human migrants, rare winged visitors from across India’s western and eastern borders have been welcomed by naturalists and included in lists of indigenous species. Miles away from their native habitats, a Pakistani butterfly and Chinese dragonfly have been recorded by citizen scientists — non-professionals who contribute to scientific research and data collection — for the first time in the India. The butterfly, Spialia zebra, was found in Dungarpur district of Rajasthan, far south of its known habitat of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab province of Pakistan. The dragonfly Atratothemis reelsi was recorded in southern Arunachal Pradesh’s Namdapha Tiger Reserve, about 1,170 km west of its previously known nearest locality of Xiaoqikong Park in China’s Guizhou Province. The sighting of the two insects was published in the latest issue of Bionotes , a quarterly newsletter for research on life forms. “The zebra skipper has added to the richness of Rajasthan’s orchid belt comprising Phulwari ki Nal Wildlife Sanctuary and Sita Mata Wildlife Sanctuary,” Mukesh Panwar told The Hindu from Sagwara in Dungarpur. He collected a specimen of the zebra skipper and provided photographs for the Butterfly Research Centre at Bhimtal in Uttarakhand to record it as the first of its kind in the country. “India now has 1,328 species of butterflies. The zebra skipper is difficult to observe because it is quite small and flies rapidly low over the ground,” said Peter Smetacek of the Bhimtal centre. In Pakistan, the butterfly has been recorded from areas where plants need very little water, and from cultivated areas in lowlands or arid foothills. ‘Bonus bug’ Minom Pertin, Roshan Upadhaya, Tajum Yomcha and Arajush Payra were on a butterfly-spotting trip in May in Namdapha. They ended up recording a dragonfly representing the westernmost range of its species and adding to the Indian Odonata fauna. Odonata is an order of predatory insects comprising dragonflies and damselflies. “It was a bonus find, never before recorded in the eastern Himalayas. It augurs well for the biodiversity of this region,” Mr. Pertin said. The quartet’s finding was reviewed by Parag Rangnekar, a Goa-based entomologist specialising in butterflies and dragonflies.

The State countered allegations that the Supervisory Committee constituted by the top court in 2014 had “delegated” its duties to a sub-committee. The court had in September sought a reply from the State on a petition filed by Joe Joseph and office-bearers of the Kothamangalam block panchayat in Kerala, expressing their apprehension about the lack of proper supervision of water levels in the over-a-century-old dam located along the Periyar Tiger Reserve. The State explained that the sub-committee is chaired by the Executive Engineer, Central Water Commission (CWC), with headquarters in Kochi. It has members from both Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The sub-committee periodically inspects the dam, collects data on seepage, collects water samples from the lake and seepage water, conducts water quality tests on them and so on, and reports the details to the Supervisory Committee. Powers of panel “The sub-committee members do not have any powers to give direction to the States. It is only doing the job of collecting information and data pertaining to the dam once in every two months, and if required, more frequently, as per directions of the Chairman of the Supervisory Committee, and furnishing the same to the committee,” the affidavit , filed through advocate M. Yokesh Kanna, said. The sub-committee is only assisting the Supervisory Committee. This cannot be called the delegation of the authority of the Supervisory Committee, the affidavit argued. The State said releases from the spillways of the dam are done in a systematic manner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mullaperiyar-dam-panel-not-delegating-duties-tn-tells-sc/article32824878.ece

Making the announcement here on Saturday, Minister in charge of Mysuru S.T. Somashekar said that Dr. Manjunath, who is also Director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research in Bengaluru, had been chosen in keeping with the decision to honour corona warriors on the occasion. Mr. Somashekar said six persons [pourakarmika Maragamma, medical officer Naveen Kumar, staff nurse Rukmini, ASHA Noor Jahan, constable Kumar P., and social worker Ayub Ahmed] will be felicitated during the inaugural programme. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) has recommended that the district administration organise a safe, virtual Dasara this year. TAC has said that the gathering for the inauguration of the festivities, atop Chamundi Hills on October 17, should be limited to 200 people. For the Jamboo Savari on the palace premises on October 26 it should be 300. The number recommended includes officials, staff on duty, artistes, and security personnel. RT-PCR negative test report (done after October 14) should be made mandatory for all participants at the venues. The committee has also recommended that cultural events at the palace from October 17 to 24 should be limited to two hours daily and the participation should not exceed 50. But novelist S.L. Bhyrappa said the Dasara festivities should be confined to households and expressed reservations over allowing even a small gathering. Speaking to reporters here, he suggested restricting the festivities to households, temples and the palace, without permitting public participation. Responding to the COVID-19 technical advisory committee’s report, he questioned the necessity of allowing even 200 persons (for the inauguration atop Chamundi Hills).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cn-manjunath-to-inaugurate-dasara-festivities/article32824998.ece

The priest’s son, Deshraj, conducted the last rites in the presence of a large police force. The priest was set ablaze by five persons over a land dispute. Vaishnav’s family has alleged that the accused wanted to encroach on land belong to the temple and were erecting a shed, leading to the dispute. The priest was farming on 15 bighas (6 acres) of land belonging to the Radha Krishna Temple Trust, while the accused had allegedly been trying to usurp. The State government also agreed to give a job on contract to a family member and release an assistance of Rs. 1.50 lakh for the construction of a house under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. The Station House Officer of Sapotra police station and the patwari (revenue officer) of the village will be transferred and the allegation of their laxity in the incident probed, officials said. Vaishnav’s family, who had received his body from Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh Hospital on Friday after his death, had earlier refused to perform the last rites until their demands were met. Giving a political twist to the issue, BJP MP Kirodi Lal Meena joined the demonstration at Bukna and the party's three-member fact-finding team reached the village on Saturday. After the arrest of the main accused, Kailash Meena, the police also detained another accused and were searching for other suspects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gehlot-govt-announces-aid-for-priests-kin/article32824866.ece

11 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Relief on loans up to Rs. 2 cr. will help pandemic-hit, RBI tells SC||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has told the Supreme Court that the Centre’s resolve to shoulder the cost of ‘interest on interest’ for MSME loans and personal loans up to Rs. 2 crore addresses pandemic-induced financial distress among borrowers. The RBI termed it additional relief. The central bank reasoned that a complete waiver, on the other hand, of compound interest (interest on interest) chargeable during the six-month moratorium would destabilise “broader financial stability” and irreparably dent the banks. “A long moratorium exceeding six months can also impact credit behaviour of borrowers and increase the risks of delinquencies post- resumption of scheduled payments. It may result in vitiating the overall credit discipline, which will have a debilitating impact on the process of credit creation in the economy. It will be the small borrowers who may end up bearing the brunt of the impact, as their access to formal lending channels is critically dependent on the credit culture,” the RBI told the Supreme Court in an affidavit filed late on October 9. The affidavit contains a consolidated reply to demands for financial reprieve and waiver of compound interest made in a host of petitions filed across sectors from power to real estate and individual borrowers hit by the virus onslaught. ‘Temporary relief’ The RBI said the moratorium was only a temporary relief implemented without discrimination. The decision on how to implement and which customer should get the benefit of moratorium was left to individual financial institutions and banks. “The lending institutions have been permitted to extend the moratorium to any borrower/class of borrower in a transparent manner based on their board-approved policies. Similarly, even the borrowers have the discretion on whether to avail of the moratorium or not, after weighing various costs involved,” the affidavit explained. The RBI explained that its Resolution Framework, based on the suggestions of the K.V. Kamath Expert Committee, issued on August 6, was aimed at facilitating revival of real sector activities and mitigating the impact on the ultimate borrowers. The framework gives complete discretion to lending institutions and borrowers to arrive at resolution plans tailored to the specific requirements of various sector, of course, subject to the “prudential boundaries”. The resolution plans to take into account the pre-Covid-19 operating and financial performance of the borrower and impact of the virus on the latter. Bleak picture The affidavit presents a bleak picture on power and real estate sectors, which were “already stressed even before the outbreak of the pandemic”. The “travails” of the real estate sector cannot be solved through banking regulations alone, the RBI noted. “Real estate sector has undergone structural changes in the recent past and is also facing a demand problem as evident from the high levels of unsold inventories and stalled projects.” The RBI said an “already existing framework” could be used to restructure projects under implementation and affected by the pandemic. “This extant framework allows for extension of timeline for completion of the projects by two years in case of non-infra projects, including real estate, and by four years for infrastructure projects without downgrading to non-performing assets”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/relief-on-loans-up-to-rs-2-cr-will-help-pandemic-hit-rbi-tells-sc/article32824825.ece

11 October 2020||New Delhi,||‘Follow SOP in crimes against women’||The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has issued an advisory to all States regarding “mandatory action by the police in crime against women”. The Ministry reiterated that the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, provides that the statement, written or verbal, by a person who is dead shall be treated as relevant fact in the investigation. Recently, the role of the Uttar Pradesh police had come under scanner after the Hathras gang-rape incident when a 19-year-old woman had given a statement from the hospital bed that she was sexually assaulted by four men from her village. The police claimed that the forensic examination had established that the victim was not raped. She later succumbed to injuries at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital. Supreme Court ruling “Section 32 (1) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, provides that the statement, written or verbal, by a person who is dead shall be treated as relevant fact in the investigation when the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death. Hon'ble Supreme Court in its order dated 7th January 2020, in the matter of Criminal Appeal Nos. 194-195 of 2012 in the case of Purshottam Chopra & Anr. v. State (Govt. of NCT Delhi), directed that a particular statement, when being offered as dying declaration and satisfies all the requirements of judicial scrutiny, cannot be discarded merely because it has not been recorded by a Magistrate or that the police officer did not obtain attestation by any person present at the time of making of the statement,” the advisory said. The MHA also said Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for completion of investigation in rape cases within two months. “In order to facilitate the State police to monitor compliance, in this regard MHA has provided an online portal called Investigation Tracking System for Sexual Offences (ITSSO) for monitoring the same. This is available exclusively to law enforcement officers,” the Ministry said. It reminded the States regarding compulsory registration of FIR in cases of cognisable offences. “The law also enables the police to register FIR or a ‘Zero FIR’ (in case the crime is committed outside the jurisdiction of police station) in the event of receipt of information on commission of a cognizable offence, which includes cases of sexual assault on women,” the Ministry said. Officials accountable It added that Section 166 A(c) of the Indian Penal Code provides for punishment to a public servant for failure to record FIR in relation to cognisable offences, including cases of sexual assault. The MHA said Section 164-A of the Cr.P.C. provides that in rape/sexual assault investigation, the victim shall be examined by a registered medical practitioner under consent within 24 hours from the time of receiving the information relating to the commission of such offence. The MHA also asked States to adhere to the guidelines issued by the Directorate of Forensic Science Services for collection, preservation and transportation of forensic evidence in sexual assault cases. “In order to facilitate the State Police, Bureau of Police Research and Development has issued Sexual Assault Evidence CollectionKits to every State/UT. It is necessary to use these SAEC kits in every case of sexual assault reported,” it said. The MHA asked States to investigate lapses in matters of women safety. “However, even with stringent provisions in law and several capacity building measures undertaken, any failure of police to adhere to these mandatory requirements may not augur well for the delivery of criminal justice in the country, especially in context of women safety. Such lapses, if noticed, need to be investigated into and stringent action taken immediately against the concerned officers responsible for the same.” the Ministry said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/follow-sop-in-crimes-against-women/article32824817.ece
11 October 2020||BHUBANESWAR,||Centre suppressing all opposing voices: Soren||Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren has lashed out at the Centre over the arrest of Stan Swamy, a prominent tribal rights activist, by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the Bhima Koregaon case. Mr. Swamy, who was arrested on Thursday by the NIA from his house in Ranchi, has been sent to judicial custody till October 23. The agency had filed the second supplementary chargesheet against seven accused and one absconding accused in the 2018 Bhima Koregaon violence case. Mr. Swamy’s name figured in the list. According to the NIA, all these accused “conspired with other accused persons to further the ideology of terrorist organisation CPI (Maoist) and abetted violence and incited disaffection towards the government”. Two days before his arrest, the activist, who is a Jesuit priest, said he had been interrogated by the NIA for 15 hours during a span of five days (July 27-30 and August 6) and that he had no problem if the agency wanted to interrogate him further through video-conference. ‘Tribals targetted’ “What kind of message does the BJP-led Central government want to send by arresting 83-year-old Mr. Swamy who has been working for tribals, Dalits and the weaker sections?” Mr. Soren asked on Twitter. “What kind of stubbornness is this to suppress all opposing voices,” he asked. Mr. Soren said, “The way the issue was handled, there must be some hidden agenda, given the BJP government’s working style.” “When they sense a political threat, tribals, Dalits and weaker sections always become the target. Stan Swamy has been working for tribals and Dalits for years. He is above 80 years of age.” When the Maharashtra police had raided Mr. Swamy’s residence in June 2019, Mr. Soren, who was then the leader of the Opposition, had strongly condemned the action. In a statement on Friday, activists appealed to the Jharkhand Chief Minister to oppose Mr. Swamy’s arrest. They demanded that Mr. Soren ask the Centre to release Mr. Swamy immediately.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-suppressing-all-opposing-voices-soren/article32825478.ece
11 October 2020||SIDDIPET,||Mallannasagar oustees are on tenterhooks||For the villagers displaced by the Mallannasagar reservoir project, generations of relationship with their land is set to come an to abrupt end, sooner or later. Each of them has a story to tell, if anyone were ready to hear it. They will all have to restart their living from zero, literally. G. Naveen Kumar is a resident of Singaram in Kondapaka mandal. His grandfather and great-grandfather were born in the same village, as was he. He does not know whether the generation before them was also born there. The Mallannasagar project turned their lives upside down. Mr. Kumar’s extended family has given about 42 acres towards the construction of Mallannasagar. Mr. Kumar’s family has given about three acres as their share in the combined family land, and they were paid a total Rs. 18 lakh for it. They also received some amount for a house. Spending all of this amount, they could only buy 150 yards of a residential plot at Siddipet, which cost them a total of Rs. 24 lakh. “We are unable to buy any land outside the purview of Mallannasagar as rates had skyrocketed by the time we received compensation. It is beyond our wildest dreams to become landowners again. Hence, we have compromised with a plot,” Mr. Kumar told The Hindu . Not only Mr. Kumar, others also know that their days with their villages are numbered. On Friday, revenue and police officials had reached neighbouring Erravalli and asked villagers there to vacate, stating that they should shift to Mutrajpally near Gajwel, where a new rehabilitation and resettlement colony is coming up. ‘A few weeks’ Officials considered the oustees’ request with sympathy and agreed to allow them to stay in the village till Dasara, the most important festival in Telangana, was over. “We will be the next target of the authorities and will be told to vacate. There is no other go but to vacate, maybe in another few weeks,” said Mr. Naveen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mallannasagar-oustees-are-on-tenterhooks/article32824799.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||‘India will be playing an important, active role in Afghan peace process’||Afghanistan’s Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, Abdullah Abdullah , has been in Delhi this week to brief the government on the Doha peace talks with the Taliban. In an interview, he said that in talks with PM Narendra Modi, NSA Ajit Doval and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, he had received New Delhi’s full support for the peace process.  You said you are on a mission to build regional consensus for the reconciliation process. Were there specific assurances you were hoping for during your visit to New Delhi? We weren’t expecting something specific. We wanted to share the details of what is going on and see how best each country can contribute. That was the aim of the visit. All the leaders [in Delhi] that I met were supportive of the people of Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, a unified and peaceful Afghanistan and supportive of an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned the peace process. India has taken one step by attending the inauguration of the Doha talks — the first time an Indian official has actually addressed a gathering including the Taliban. Did you discuss whether India would engage the Taliban more directly now? I didn’t have a specific recommendation as far as engagement with the Taliban is concerned but I will say India will be playing an important role, active role with the rest of the partners of the international community from the region [in the process] and beyond. Did you receive any assurances on Pakistan’s support when it comes to announcing a ceasefire during your visit there last week? [We are still hopeful of] a ceasefire or significant reduction in violence. [Pakistani officials] were supportive of that idea and they also promised that they will communicate this and they will try to use their own influence to achieve that. Even so, are you at all hopeful? Just looking at the figures, 1,300 civilian casualties in the first half of this year, a 60% rise in attacks on Afghan forces from this quarter compared to the previous quarter…. The people of Afghanistan were expecting that as the [Doha] talks started, we would have a ceasefire or a significant reduction in violence. Our negotiating team was ready from day one to start discussions on a ceasefire. The progress so far has been slow, but hopefully, with the help of different players and also with the patience that we will show, the civility we will show there will be a transition to less violence. Are you on the same page as the President Ghani government? Just 10 months ago, you were in a legal battle with President Ghani, contesting the presidential elections you both fought… That’s democracy. Given the fact that we contested elections [against each other] means that we were not on the same page on some issues. But when it is in the interest of the country, in the interest of peaceful Afghanistan, democratic Afghanistan, an Afghanistan which respects the rights of its citizens, men, women, minorities and others, on that we are on the same page. US President Trump has already said that by Christmas, he hopes to have all U.S. troops return. Are you considering the possible need for a regional peacekeeping force if the Americans do pull out completely? First of all, on the recent announcement by President Trump, the details are not yet available to us. They already had announced, according to their agreement, to keep 4,500 troops and to pull-out the rest of it, which will be completed by November. So, we are not sure what these announcements refer to. But eventually, Afghanistan needs to stand on its own feet and support from the region for a peaceful, inclusive settlement is important. Hopefully, we will get to an agreement that will not require security forces from other countries to keep us safe. But have you discussed that possibility in India? No, no, that was not part of our discussions.  Hopefully, with the help of different players and also with the patience that we will show, the civility we will show there will be a transition to less violence||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-will-be-playing-an-important-active-role-in-afghan-peace-process/article32824808.ece

A police spokesperson said two militants, who were trapped after receiving a specific input, were killed in the Chinigam area of Kulgam in a joint cordon and search operation. The slain militants were identified as Tariq Ahmad Mir, a resident of Zangalpora Divsar in Kulgam, and Sameer Bhai alias Usman, a resident of Punjab in Pakistan. “Both were affiliated with the Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM),” the spokesperson said. Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar appreciated the role of the security forces “for timely and safe evacuation of civilians during encounter and for maintaining strict restraint during the search of two mosques inside the cordon area”. The police said due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the bodies of the terrorists will be sent to Handwara for burial, and only the nearest family members will be allowed to participate in the last rites. In another encounter, which broke out on Saturday afternoon, two militants were killed in Pulwama’s Dadura area. “Lashkar-e-Taiba’s top commander Zahid Nazir Bhat, alias Zahid Tiger, was among the two slain militants. It’s a big success for the security forces,” Mr. Kumar said. Arms smuggling Meanwhile, the Army foiled a bid to smuggle weapons along the LoC at the Keran Sector in north Kashmir’s Kupwara. Four AK-47 rifles, eight magazines and 240 rounds were recovered during the anti-infiltration operation, where a rope was used across a river, the Army said. “Pakistan has not stopped helping militants to infiltrate into this part of Kashmir and to fan violence.

The list includes leaders who had questioned the party’s leadership through a letter in August. The list, issued by general secretary K.C.

Ms. Gandhi and Dr. Singh, however, are unlikely to travel to Bihar in the midst of the pandemic and the party may instead opt for digital rallies for them. The former party chief is likely to be principal campaigner for the Congress even though Mr. Gandhi’s election tour programme is yet to be finalized, said a source. Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled States, including Amarinder Singh (Punjab), Ashok Gehlot (Rajasthan), Bhupesh Baghel (Chhattisgarh), will also be part of the campaign.Of the 243 seats, the Congress is contesting 70 seats in an alliance with the RJD and the Left parties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/inclusive-cong-gears-up-for-bihar/article32824813.ece

The national advisory board of the COFEPOSA approved the proposal submitted by the investigating team. The accused can be detained in prison for one year under the provisions of the Act. The Customs had decided to impose the Act after it found that the accused were involved in smuggling on multiple occasions. Questioned for 11 hours Customs on Saturday let off M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, after questioning him for nearly 11 hours in connection with the gold smuggling case. He has been asked to appear before the investigating officials again on Tuesday. Mr. Sivasankar had appeared at the Customs office here for the second consecutive day in connection with the probe into the import of dates through diplomatic cargo in 2017. The Customs Commissionerate (Preventive) had quizzed him on various aspects of the gold smuggling case and his alleged links with the key accused Swapna Suresh. Customs had found that the dates were distributed by the Social Justice Department to various children’s homes even though it was brought in as diplomatic baggage to avail duty exemption. The department is also looking into reports that a section of the consignments of dates was diverted outside without distributing it among the children’s homes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cofeposa-invoked-against-swapna-suresh-sandeep-nair/article32824802.ece

11 October 2020||Kozhikode,||BJP in damage control mode||The participation of public relations professional Smitha Menon in an event for Foreign Ministers in the UAE has turned out to be an embarrassment for the BJP Kerala unit when the party was seeking the resignations of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case and Minister for Higher Education K.T. Jaleel for protocol violations. The controversy surrounds the alleged breach of protocol by Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan for helping Ms. Menon to participate in the the 19th meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) held in Abu Dhabi in November last. Incidentally, Ms. Menon is also the State secretary of the Mahila Morcha, an affiliate of the BJP. The issue cropped up after Saleem Madavoor, president, Loktantrik Yuva Janata Dal, submitted a complaint to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). The IORA is an organisation of 22 member countries and 10 other dialogue partners. He had also sought to conduct an inquiry on the “breach of protocol” by the Minister. However, Mr. Muraleedharan and BJP State president K. Surendran had clarified that no protocol had been violated in this regard. Also, Ms. Menon had clarified that she had attended the meeting as a mediaperson and that too on her own expenses to report the event. Putting up a sturdy defence, Mr. Surendran also went on to clarify that he had recommended her name for the post in the Mahila Morcha and that more professionals would be inducted into the BJP and its feeder outfits. He said that Ms. Menon belonged to a Sangh Parivar family. Notwithstanding these damage-control exercises, the issue has given the anti-Muraleedharan camp in the BJP to whip up, overtly and covertly, the controversy. Except Mr. Surendran, no prominent leaders from the rival camp came out in support of Mr. Muraleedharan. The episode emerged when the BJP was intensifying its agitation against the LDF government with slogans of anti-corruption on various fronts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-in-damage-control-mode/article32825142.ece
11 October 2020||HUBBALLI,||TS, Goa trying to create new problem: Jarkiholi||Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi has accused Telangana and Goa of trying to create new controversy over the sharing of Krishna and Mahadayi waters and assured that the State government would not allow injustice to be meted out to Karnataka in this regard. In a press release issued after a telephonic talk with Union Minister of Water Resources Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Mr. Jarkiholi has said that the State government would present its arguments effectively before the Union Government and the Supreme Court. Mr. Jarkiholi has said that Telengana is trying to make an issue out of Krishna river water sharing on which the Tribunal had already given its final verdict in 2013. “Already water share has been allocated to the States of Karnataka, Maharashtra and the earlier united Andhra Pradesh. The Union Government too has decided to notify the verdict after the Supreme Court verdict. At this point, Telangana’s plea for setting up new water disputes tribunal is illogical,” he has said. The Minister has said in the release that he had discussed in detail the issue with the Mr. Shekhawat following a plea for new tribunal by Telangana. During the telephonic conversation, the Minister had urged the Union Minister not to bring in Karnataka in between the differences between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana as already Krishna River Disputes Tribunal had given its final verdict in 2013. As the water requirements of Telangana had already been considered as it was part of the united Andhra Pradesh, Telangana had to get its share from Andhra Pradesh and various Supreme Court orders too are clear in this regard. Considering these facts, the two States should sit together and sort out the differences in water sharing through dialogue. The demand for new tribunal is certainly not a justifiable one, Mr. Jarkiholi told the Union Minister, the release said. ‘Ludicrous petition’ Regarding Mahadayi, Mr Jarkiholi has termed the contempt petition by Goa government as “ludicrous.” “Already Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal’ has given its final verdict and the Union Government too has notified the verdict. It is really funny that Goa government has now filed a contempt of court petition against Karnataka government,” he said in the release. Terming the photographs and videos released by Goa government as “fabricated documents”, Mr. Jarkiholi has said that the Karnataka government would face the charges effectively in the Supreme Court. He said he had received a factual report on the ground situation from the committee comprising of senior officials of the Water Resources Department from both the States. Meanwhile, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa too has written a letter to the Union Water Resources Minister urging him to facilitate utilisation of the allotted share of water to Karnataka, the Minister said.  Karnataka will present its arguments effectively before the Centre and the Supreme Court.

11 October 2020||Bengaluru,||HC comes to rescue of Karnataka student||Observing that “a tender age student, even when delinquency is established, cannot be treated as an offender of the war crime,” the Karnataka High Court has directed the CBSE to immediately announce the result of a student of class 12, who was asked to reappear for an exam in one of the subjects without announcing the result for carrying a mobile phone inside the examination hall on March 14. Justice Krishna S. Dixit passed the order while allowing a petition filed by Shuchi Mishra, who had appeared for CBSE Class 12 main examinations in Bengaluru. The court directed the CBSE to immediately announce the results of biology subject. The court, from the records, found that the petitioner had inadvertently carried mobile phone inside the exam hall and had handed it over to the invigilator just before commencement of the exam, but the CBSE had treated her case as “unfair means” for “using mobile phone during examination.” “The student’s assertion that she had deposited the mobile at 9.55 a.m., that is prior to commencement of examination, to the centre invigilator becomes evident by the fact that it was sent to her school, which was in turn delivered it back to her after examination and on the same day,” the court observed. The court also noted the CBSE committee had not made any effort to view video footages of the exam hall as every hall was under electronic surveillance and had denied personal hearing to the student. Pointing out that there was no allegation that the petitioner had clandestinely stored the examination material in the said phone for making “unfair use” of the same, the court said, “though a student is expected not to carry such instrument into the exam hall but human fallibility, more particularly in case of children going to exam with associated anxiety needs to be kept in mind as an extreme penalty of cancelling exam violates the rule of proportionality and it shakes the consciousness of the court, to say the least.” Observing that “tender minds, even when they commit significant mistakes, cannot be treated with iron gloves”, the court said that “one cannot be oblivious to the anxiety of the students and their parents during the crucial examination of the kind, especially during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic; carrying mobile phone instrument during such difficult periods by anyone admits rationalisation. Even in court halls, mobile phones of counsel ring often loudly despite repeated instructions to keep them in idle mode; that is not a case of serious culpability; an argument to the contrary would be abhorrent to notions of reasons and justice.” As the petitioner became ineligible to take compartment exam owing to non-declaration of result in biology subject coupled with her failure in maths subject, the court directed the CBSE to announce result in biology and organise necessary exam for her, if eligible otherwise, in same syllabi by December 31.  Though a student is expected not to carry such instrument into the exam hall but human fallibility, more particularly in case of children going to exam, with associated anxiety needs to be kept in mind as an extreme penalty of cancelling exam violates the rule of proportionality and it shakes the consciousness of the court, to say the least.Karnataka High Court||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-comes-to-rescue-of-karnataka-student/article32824791.ece
11 October 2020||New Delhi,||Rahul targets Modi again on VIP plane||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi again on the purchase of a VIP aircraft by tweeting a video clip showing jawans in a truck saying that their lives were being put at risk by ferrying them in a non-bullet-proof vehicle. “Our jawans are being sent in non-bullet-proof trucks to become martyrs, while a Rs. 8,400 crore plane is for the Prime Minister. Is this justice?” asked Mr. Gandhi on Twitter, tagging the two-minute video clip. Neither the date of the video nor its location is known but the jawans were seen complaining that they were being sent in a non-bullet-proof vehicle when even a bullet-proof vehicle in their area was not sufficient to protect them. Mr. Gandhi has targeted Mr. Modi for the second time in two days over the purchase of the VIP aircraft. First tweet On Thursday, the Congress leader tweeted to show the number of essential items the government could have purchased for soldiers posted in Siachen-Ladakh with the amount spent on the aircraft. His tweet was in response to a news report in a Hindi newspaper that claimed that the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament had sought permission from the Lok Sabha Speaker to visit Ladakh for an assessment on the ground after a Comptroller and Auditor General report flagged delays in the procurement of essential items for soldiers. “The Prime Minister spent Rs. 8,400 crore to acquire an air plane. For our soldiers posted in Siachen-Ladakh, this amount could have bought: Warm Clothing: 30,00,000, Jackets and gloves: 60,00,000, Shoes: 67,20,000, Oxygen Cylinders: 16,80,000. PM is only concerned about his image and not soldiers,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted. Government sources, however, clarified that the VIP aircraft acquisition was cleared by the United Progressive Alliance government and was delivered during the current regime. Mr. Gandhi’s barbs over the VIP aircraft purchase started after the BJP leaders had attacked him for using a cushion during his tractor rally in Punjab earlier this week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahul-targets-modi-again-on-vip-plane/article32824819.ece

Therefore, the 148 numbers of madrasa contractual teachers may be shifted to schools under general secondary education,” read an official memo from Assam Secondary Education Department’s Deputy Secretary S.N. Das to the Director of Secondary Education earlier this month. Copies of the memo were sent to the office of Education Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and the mission director of Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan in Assam. The Assam government a couple of years ago decided to shut madrasas and tols (educational institutions focussing on Sanskrit learning) under State boards as “religious teachings cannot be carried out with government funds in a secular country”. The Assam government runs 614 madrasas, while 900 are run privately, mostly by the Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind. There are about 100 government-run and 500 private Sanksrit tols in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assam-begins-closure-of-614-government-run-madrasas/article32824827.ece

Ms. Sarangi hit back demanding closure of the Biju Janata Dal party office where leaders had reportedly thrown guidelines to the wind while celebrating party leaders’ birthday. Minister of State for Home Dibya Shankar Mishra on Friday wrote to Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai seeking to rein in Ms. Sarangi who is being accused of “habitually violating the pandemic norms”. She celebrated her birthday amidst scores of supporters. Early on Saturday, the BMC officials came to seal the Palaspalli office of the MP. According to the BMC, the office will remain closed for 15 days for sanitisation. ‘Shut BJD office’ An enraged Ms. Sarangi presented 17 photographs showing BJD leaders attending functions at party office without masks and maintaining social distance. She questioned the inaction of the authorities against virus-infected Minister Samir Ranjan Das and Satyabadi MLA Umakant Samantray for participating in the funeral procession of former Minister Pradeep Maharathy recently. “The closure of my office is intended to halt developmental activities being taken up in wards and panchayats. As long as my office remains sealed, I will hold my grievance redressal sessions by the roadside,” said Ms. Sarangi. She dared Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik to take action against his party leaders for violating the norms. Mr. Samantray, against whom a case was lodged in the Seabeach police station, Puri, tendered an unconditional apology on Saturday for participating in the funeral procession despite testing positive. The pandemic situation continued to remain grim. With 15 more deaths on Saturday, the toll has risen to 1,006.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Police, media & spectacle of grief in Boolgarhi||He rushed in to record every time the victim’s sister-in-law (wife of the victim’s elder brother), who was present in the village, gets agitated with the constant probing. She says, “A narrative is being built to malign the victim by leaking the call details. It is a conspiracy to discredit us. The victim was uneducated and didn’t know how to use a phone.” She says she usually keeps the said phone, which is in her father-in-law’s name. Call data records reportedly show calls made from Sandeep’s (one of the accused) phone to the phone of the victim's brother, and vice-versa. The family of Chanderpal, uncle of the victim’s father who purportedly was one of the four close relatives of the family who participated in the last rites, is worried because the old man has been taken to Hathras to record his statement. “He went to the cremation ground after his nephew asked him to do so. When he reached there, the pyre was already lit,” says Prakash, his son. Policemen took wooden sticks and cow dung cakes from their residence, adds Prakash, and says, “But at that time, the body hasn’t reached the village and we didn’t know that they would burn it without even showing us the face.” Prakash and his wife maintain they had heard of an argument between the two families about the phone calls made by Sandeep, one of arrested accused. “I don’t know the exact date but it happened before the lockdown. When the father of the victim complained, Guddu, Sandeep’s father, had slapped him. After that, Sandeep left the village,” says Prakash, adding his cousin did not reveal it because “in a village such things bring a bad name only to the girl”. While Guddu and his wife are not in the village, Rajwati, mother of Ramu Singh, another arrested accused, who is also Sandeep’s uncle, says she is not aware of the incident but confirms that Sandeep had left the village in March to work with a courier company in Delhi and returned about 10 days before the incident. She says that though Sandeep has attended high school, he could not write a letter. “I cannot say about Sandeep, but my son Ramu was at the dairy at the time of the incident,” she insisted. Some of the men of the accused’s household have returned to the village and have recorded their statements with the Special Investigation Team (SIT). “We hope we will get justice,” says Hariom, Ramu’s elder brother. “We are not aware whether the girl and Sandeep were in touch and have come to know about the letter only through the media,” he says. But he has no answer as to why it took Sandeep so long to divulge the details of the “relationship”, considering he was arrested on September 19. “We were all hiding because earlier the police would detain anybody related to the accused,” he said. Towards the end of the day, when The Hindu asked the father of the victim about the phone calls, he said, “The purpose of those calls should also be revealed. It could have been part of his conspiracy. She has already died a thousand times in the last week...” Seema Kushwaha, lawyer of the victim’s family, who will accompany the four members of the family before the Allahabad High Court’s Lucknow Bench on October 12, says, “Even if the calls were made, did it give the accused the right to rape and kill the victim?” she wonders, refuting the honour killing narrative. “The victim’s first statement, made at the Chandpa police station on September 14, was enough to invoke sections of rape,” asserted Ms. Kushwaha. “Burning the body without the family’s consent was inhuman,” she said.  ( The names of the relatives of the victim have been changed. )||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/police-media-spectacle-of-grief-in-boolgarhi/article32824783.ece

11 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||50% quota for women in GHMC polls||The Cabinet on Saturday approved 50% reservation for women in the elected body of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporations ahead of polls. Effectively, 75 out of 150 divisions in GHMC will be reserved for women. A Bill amending the GHMC Act to the effect will be taken up by the Assembly on Tuesday. By other decisions, the Cabinet also decided to amend laws to provide for changes in the functions of municipal ward committees and reservation of wards. The deadline for online uploading of information about landed properties has been extended by 10 days up to October 20. The Cabinet meeting, presided by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, also discussed the character of integrated township in Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority limits. It was decided at the meeting to simplify the conversion of agricultural land for non-agricultural use by amending the NALA law on non-agricultural lands. The amendment will be made to enable people make the necessary changes online through Dharani portal. The move was an extension of the amendment to the revenue law of State government removing the discretionary powers of officers to regulate conversion of agricultural land for non-agricultural use. The human intervention was already removed in the Act passed in the last session of Assembly. A release said the Cabinet discussed in detail the steps taken by government to see that the farmers did not face hardship on account of COVID. Just as agricultural produce was procured in villages instead of market yards in the kharif, the same system will be followed in rabi as the virus had not receded. As many as 6,000 centres will be opened in villages to procure produce from the last farmer. There was no need for farmers to panic but they must ensure that the moisture content in foodgrains did not exceed 17 %. The grains must be dust free. The Cabinet expressed anguish at the inability of maize farmers to get minimum support price due to the decisions of the Centre. It was unfortunate that the decisions spelt danger to agriculture sector. The meeting also noted with despair the decision of Centre to import maize from other countries in spite of the availability of maize in quantities more than consumption levels. The meeting appealed to maize farmers to take a guarded decision on cultivation of the crop keeping in view the glut in global market and the Centre’s decisions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/50-quota-for-women-in-ghmc/article32825485.ece

He shared a video of a news report about the Class 9 student in his Twitter handle and praised her for her melodious voice. “I am proud of Devika. Her melodious rendering strengthens the essence of ‘One India, Great India’,” the Prime Minister said in his tweet in Malayalam, sharing the report telecast by a Malayalam news channel. Himachal CM His tweet came a day after Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jairam Thakur shared the video of Devika from Thiruvananthapuram singing ‘Chamba kitni ki door’ on his Facebook wall and said she had “won the hearts of the entire State”. Devika, a student of Kendriya Vidyalaya at Pattom in Thiruvananthapuram, had sung the song under the ‘Ek Bharat Shreshth Bharat’ programme. “It is unbelievable. I am very happy. When I sang the song, I never expected that I would be congratulated by the Prime Minister sir himself,” Devika told a TV news channel, responding to Mr. Modi’s tweet. The student expressed her gratitude to the Prime Minister for enjoying her song. Cultural Affairs Minister A.K. Balan telephoned Devika to congratulate her. In a Facebook post on Friday, Mr. Thakur had said Kerala’s daughter, Devika, in her melodious voice, had enhanced the glory of his State by singing the famous Himachali song.

In an email to Mr Kumar, former Telangana State Public Service Commission member T Vivek and former civil servant G Venkat Ram Reddy, among others, questioned the rationale behind seeking Aadhaar numbers of property owners. “We wonder whether the functionaries or their superiors are oblivious of the Hon’ble Supreme Court judgment on the issue of Aadhaar number and its uses. A careful reading of the judgment makes the reader wise to desist from obtaining Aadhar details unless there is a quid pro quo between the State and the citizen,” an excerpt from the email reads. They also sought to know why in the TS NPB Dharani Enlistment form, the government requires property owners to furnish details of how a property was acquired. Speaking to The Hindu , both Mr Vivek and Mr Reddy said that the government should clarify on the aspects on which the email touches upon. “What is the reason for asking Aadhaar details? What is that you are giving in return? Why are you asking for Aadhaar numbers? It is the order of the Apex Court (quid pro quo between the State and the citizen),” Mr Vivek said. Mr Reddy too raised a similar point.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ex-civil-servants-write-to-cs/article32825582.ece

Corps Commander of the Srinagar-based Chinar Corps Lt. Gen. B.S. Raju, however, said there is military cooperation between Pakistan and China in terms of equipment. Media reports quoting intelligence inputs have claimed that China is helping Pakistan set up sites for surface-to-air missiles in PoK as soldiers of their armies have been carrying out joint patrols in the region. Gen. Raju said there has not been any such indication. “I have seen the reports in the media. Whether Pakistan is helping China or China is helping Pakistan, we have no such indication,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a passing out-cum-attestation parade at the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry Regimental Centre on the outskirts of the city here. “But because of the CPEC [China-Pakistan Economic Corridor], there is the presence of China in Pakistan. The military cooperation in terms of equipment is there but we are not seeing any tactical help.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-indication-of-missile-sites-in-pok-army/article32824809.ece

Navy ships will hold a PASSEX with USS Ronald Reagan on October 12 as it transits through the Indian Ocean, the official said. The PASSEX is likely to be held in the waters off Kochi. On September 25, for the first time a U.S. Navy P-8A long range maritime patrol aircraft landed at Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, for refuelling under the bilateral logistics support agreement. In July, front-line warships of the Navy conducted a PASSEX with the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz carrier strike group near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as it was transiting the Indian Ocean. The USS Nimitz was returning from the South China Sea through the Strait of Malacca where it undertook Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOP). The USS Ronald Reagan was in the South China Sea in August to conduct FONOPs amid tensions between China and the U.S. The trilateral Malabar Naval exercise with Japan and the U.S. is also scheduled to be held in November, though there is no clarity on inviting Australia for the exercise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/navy-to-hold-passex-with-us-carrier/article32824810.ece

At an induction programme organised by the State BJP for more than 700 members of two tribal groups on Friday, Mr. Sonowal said the indigenous communities should come together to defeat the “conspiracy of illegal foreigners” to take over Assam. “The bhumiputra [sons of the soil] are not fully safe because the Mughal aggression is still on,” he said after the members of the Bodoland People’s Front, one of the BJP’s two regional allies, and the United Bodo People’s Organisation, representing Bodo people living outside the Bodoland Territorial Council, joined the saffron party.

11 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||University of Madras facing an acute resource crunch||With 56% of faculty positions lying vacant, University of Madras (UoM) is facing an acute shortage in terms of human resources and potential decline in academic and research activities. Data available with The Hindu showed that at least seven departments did not have a single full-time faculty member and 14 departments had more than 70% of their sanctioned posts vacant. The shortage is acutely felt in the three Centres of Advanced Study (CAS) in Mathematics, Botany, Crystallography and Biophysics, which receive additional grants from the University Grants Commission (UGC), and are at risk of losing them without the minimum required faculty strength and research output. Moreover, an analysis of National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) data for the university showed that 50% of the roughly 80 professors are in the age group of 56 and above. “If the vacancies are not filled in the near future, majority of the departments will not have a single Professor with retirements expected in the coming years,” a senior faculty member said. The last recruitment happened six years ago, but faced some allegations of irregularities. G. Shanmugam, former Head of CAS in Crystallography and Biophysics and former university syndicate member, said the risk of losing CAS recognition by UGC was real. “We already lost it for the Department of Philosophy in the past,” he said. The Ramanujan Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics, one of the CAS, has a sanctioned strength of five professors, five associate professors, and 11 assistant professors. However, it presently has only seven assistant professors and not a single professor or associate professor. The CAS in Botany with a sanctioned strength of 22 faculty members now has one professor and five assistant professors. Stating the department needed a minimum strength of six to maintain the CAS status, Mr. Shanmugam pointed out that N. Mathivanan, the professor and head of the department, is now holding the post of Registrar (in-charge) as well. Similarly, the CAS in Crystallography and Biophysics had eight faculty members, which included a professor and seven assistant professors, against the sanctioned strength of 18. “The three CAS in the university had many stalwarts in the yesteryears. Now, many departments are not even able to fully utilise their research grants,” Mr. Shanmugam pointed out. The head of one of the departments, said many departments with research potential were not able to apply for CAS status due to lack of minimum number of faculty. “When a university does not have adequate faculty members, it is not doing justice to its students,” he said. In a competitive environment with rankings and accreditations, the university would not be able to maintain its status if it did not have competent faculty, who formed the core of the university system, he added. Pointing out that over 50% of the non-teaching staff positions were also vacant, a Syndicate member said the financial crisis faced by the university had to be tackled with a long-term, sustainable solution. “A key reason for not recruiting is the deep financial crisis with the university not in a position to even honour its commitments to pensioners. However, without enough faculty we are also losing out on grants from the UGC and the State,” he said. Vice-Chancellor S. Gowri, who took charge in August, said he was studying the issue to explore possible options to address it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/university-of-madras-facing-an-acute-resource-crunch/article32825511.ece

According to the personal manager, Mr. Kudawla’s son would be playing the lead in the film produced by AVR productions, owned by Anbuvel Rajan. Mr. Soori had agreed to act on a remuneration of Rs. 40 lakh for 15 days shooting. Later, they changed the production name to Vishnu Vishal Movies and the name of the film was changed to Kadha Nayagan . Though re-shoot was done for 32 days, Mr. Soori claimed he did not receive payment. During the course of the film shooting, Mr. Soori evinced interest in buying land. Mr. Kudawla offered to help him and asked his business associate to facilitate the process. He was shown a property of 1.8 acres in Siruseri and Mr. Rajan claimed that he was holding an agreement over the property. Mr. Kudawla paid Rs. 40 lakh as advance for the property, which was the payment meant for Mr. Soori for acting in the film. Mr. Soori paid Rs. 3.15 crore altogether. Only after registration in 2018, Mr. Soori came to know that the land was not approved as residential property. He claimed he learnt that Mr. Rajan and Mr. Kudawla together had cheated him by misusing their power as agreement holders, the petitioner said. Mr. Soori’s advocate L. Infant Dinesh said initially they had sent a postal complaint to the Adyar police and other police authorities. “Since there was no response, we approached a metropolitan magistrate court seeking a direction to the police to register a case. On the orders of the court, police registered a case against them on Thursday.” Vishal denies allegations Mr. Vishnu Vishal issued a statement denying all allegations against him and his father. He said: “It is so shocking and painful to read such false allegations against me and my father. Obviously, vested interests are working. In fact, Soori has to refund to Vishnu Vishal Studioz an advance paid to him in 2017 for a film Kavarimaan Parambarai , which eventually was dropped. We have complete faith in the law and the judiciary system... (we) will strictly go by what the law permits.” Sources said the case has been forwarded by the Adyar police to the Central Crime Branch investigation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/actor-vishnu-vishals-father-booked-for-allegedly-cheating-actor-soori/article32824957.ece
11 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||RERA Act is in addition to other laws, rules authority||The Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TNRERA) has ruled that the provisions of the RERA Act are in addition to and not in derogation of other laws. A.R. Ravisankar, a home buyer, filed a petition before the authority, stating that he booked a flat with Marg Properties Ltd.’s ‘Savithanjali’ project being developed at Kalavakkam village in Thiruporur Panchayat limits. On September 24, 2012, he entered into an agreement of sale and construction for about Rs. 44 lakh and paid Rs. 40.9 lakh to the builder, who undertook to deliver the completed flat by December 2013 with a grace period of three months, according to the petition. The complainant said the builder had not yet delivered the flat, and sought refund of the amount, paid along with interest and compensation, for non-delivery of the flat. In its response, Marg Properties said the petitioner had already filed a complaint before the State Consumer Commission and could not use a different forum seeking the same relief. Concurrent remedies TNRERA pointed out that the Supreme Court had held that the remedies under the Consumer Protection Act and the RERA were concurrent remedies. Section 88 of the RERA Act made it clear that the application of the provisions of the Act were in addition to, and not in derogation of other laws. Therefore, the complainant could maintain this complaint for relief under the RERA Act, even if the agreement contained arbitration clause, the Authority ruled and directed the builder to refund the amount paid to the buyer along with interest of 10.05% a year. It said the buyer was entitled for Rs. 69,700 towards the cost of the registration of the sale deed and Rs. 1 lakh compensation for hardship and mental agony, in addition to Rs. 20,000 towards litigation expenses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rera-act-is-in-addition-to-other-laws-rules-authority/article32824995.ece

11 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Founder of Vishranthi Old Age Home dead||Savithri Vaithi, founder of Vishranthi, a home for the elderly, died in Chennai on Saturday after prolonged illness. She was 90. Her niece R. Srilekha said Ms. Vaithi suffered cardiac arrest in the early hours of Saturday. Ms. Vaithi, who hailed from a family of judges in Mylapore, was raised in a joint family. She began her journey in social work when she was barely 16. She founded the Monday Charity Club in 1974 and the Vishranthi Old Age Home in 1978. Sundari Selvam, administrative officer of Vishranthi, who has been in Ms. Vaithi’s household from the age of 13, has fond memories of her. “The Monday Charity Club started with a subscription of Rs. 2 and the women met between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. They learned to cook, bake and make juices. The money from the sale proceeds was distributed among the poor and needy, for education and marriage. The club also set up a library.” Ms. Selvam said Ms. Vaithi took the advice of the Sankaracharya of Kanchi Mutt before launching the old age home for destitute women. “She started the home with just one grandmother. Now, it has 120 residents and 35 women staff members,” she added. Kumuda Srinivasan, a long-time associate, recalled joining the club as a member. “Once during a discussion with philanthropist Mary Clubwallah Jadhav, the subject of starting an old age home was mentioned. But it was forgotten as there were concerns about running it. But then Ms. Vaithi stood up and said she would do it,” Ms. Srinivasan said. The journey was fraught with struggles. Nobody took them seriously but Ms. Vaithi did not give up. Finally in 1978, with support in the form of land from A.V.M. Rajeshwari and finance from Help Age India in Palavakkam, Vishranthi found roots.  Ms. Vaithi relied on V.S. Natarajan, then a medical student pursuing geriatrics at the Madras Medical College, for medical treatment of the elderly women. “Three important events took place in 1978. We started a geriatric outpatient ward, Savithri Vaithi was launching an old age home and Indirani Rajadurai became the regional director of Help Age India. At that time, the elderly in the home were all healthy but within a period of five to 10 years, as many as 5%-10% people began suffering health issues — either falls or concussion. I used to conduct geriatric camps for them,” Dr. Natarajan recalled. ‘Pioneer in social work’ Lakshmi Natarajan, vice-president of the Monday Charity Club, said: “Vishranthi was the first home for the elderly to be started in Chennai. She was a pioneer in social work and was one of the first women to get public and media attention to focus on the plight of aged women.” C.T. Indira, former professor of English at the University of Madras and Ms. Vaithi’s niece, said: “The most courageous act was her decision to perform the funeral rites for the deceased herself when she found that family members were either not available or not willing to take up the responsibility. She comes in the illustrious tradition of progressive women leaders who marked the period before and after independence, devoting their life to the cause of public good in an altruistic spirit. She was a role model for many in my generation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/founder-of-vishranthi-old-age-home-dead/article32825499.ece
11 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. officials to meet ECR residents||The Greater Chennai Corporation will soon convene a meeting of residents living along the East Coast Road (ECR) to explain the details of the integrated stormwater drain (SWD) project from Kottivakkam to Uthandi. Officials of the civic body said the project was aimed at preventing flooding in localities and that they had also incorporated rainwater harvesting (RWH) structures to ensure recharge of groundwater. RWH systems Retention ponds would be created in parks along with 171 RWH wells on road margins and 22,450 RWH pits, explained an official. Residents have been carrying out agitations against the SWD project. V. Suresh, of Kapaleeswarar Nagar, said the land on the eastern side of the ECR was sandy and did not require any artificial SWD system to carry rainwater. ‘Project not needed’ “This underground aquifer extends from Valmiki Nagar to Uthandi and it absorbs water like a sponge,” he said. Sushma Erevelles, another resident, said residents from 38 colonies had come together to stop the civic body from implementing the project. “Floods have never occurred on this side of the ECR, even during the 2015 deluge. The stormwater drain system will only end up becoming a glorified sewage carrier, which we do not want,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-officials-to-meet-ecr-residents/article32825503.ece
11 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Cancel bail to repeat offenders to prevent further crime, says Police Commissioner||Public prosecutors and police officers have been asked to invoke the provision for cancellation of bail granted to any repeat offender so as to prevent him from committing further crimes. This was informed at a coordination meeting of police officers, public prosecutors and assistant public prosecutors of the city courts here. Underscoring the importance of close coordination between police and prosecution officers, City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal said, “After a long lockdown, criminal activities have almost reached normal levels. Our idea is to meet the challenges of law and order and crime prevention through legal means, for which both the Police Department and the prosecution have to work in full cooperation and coordination.” He said prosecution officers could directly contact the Deputy Commissioner in their respective areas if they found any lacunae in evidence collection, FIR drafting and filing of charge sheet. Stressing the need for invoking the provision for cancellation of the bail granted to repeat offenders, Mr. Aggarwal said a criminal involved in many cases should not be allowed to roam free on the streets and plan to commit another offence. “All of us feel that such criminals have no other place than jail.” He said that when bail was granted, there was an underlying perception that the criminal would not get into a similar crime again. It was the duty of the criminal justice system, consisting of police and prosecution authorities, to protect society from such criminals. Distressing situation “I am personally very anguished when I hear the incidents of crime. Each and every incident of crime brings before me the pain and trauma felt by the victim,” Mr. Aggarwal said, urging police officers and prosecution officials to work to ensure a peaceful society. The officers were asked to expedite the trial in long-pending cases and get a deterrent punishment. They also analysed causes for the delay in trial and discussed ways to improve production of prosecution witnesses and evidence in courts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cancel-bail-to-repeat-offenders-to-prevent-further-crime-says-police-commissioner/article32825513.ece
11 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stalin urges CM to release White Paper on investments and jobs||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday challenged Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to release a White Paper on the number of investments attracted and jobs created under the AIADMK government. “If the Chief Minister really has the guts, let him release the White Paper on the number of investments and jobs created. I also request him to release another White Paper on the procurements made for tackling COVID-19,” he said in a statement. Only when the White Papers is released would the corruption committed by the government come to light, he said. He termed as “mere eyewash” the Chief Minister’s statement that the government had made Tamil Nadu one of the top investment destinations in India.  Rise in COVID-19 cases The status of memoranda of understanding signed at the two Global Investors Meet was not known, he said, adding that the number of COVID-19 cases was increasing in the State. The State’s debt had touched Rs. 4.56 lakh crore and reports said the government had so far borrowed Rs. 50,000 crore this year, he said. In addition, the government had said it would go with option 1 on GST compensation, which meant it had agreed to borrow from the market and had surrendered the State’s rights to the GST Council, he said. The State did not have the data on the death of healthcare workers and doctors, and the district-wise break-down of the number of tests was also not shared, he said. Mr. Stalin alleged that the Chief Minister and his Cabinet colleagues were flouting physical distancing norms in the name of meetings, including the one to announce the AIADMK’s candidate for Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-urges-cm-to-release-white-paper-on-investments-and-jobs/article32824931.ece
11 October 2020||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||DMK flags issue of law universities flouting OBC reservation norms||DMK Parliamentary Party leader and treasurer, T. R. Baalu has written to Union Education Minister Dr. Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, flagging violations of the Other Backward Classes (OBC) reservation policy in admissions to the National Law Universities (NLUs) for the academic year 2020-21. “There is zero reservation for OBC candidates in admission to Under Graduate as well as Post Graduate courses conducted by the NLUs,” he pointed out in the letter. Guidelines ignored The Central Educational Institutions (Reservations in Admissions) Act, 2006 and UGC guidelines mandate that Universities implement 27% reservation for OBCs both in admissions and in recruitment. But in NLUs, this has been totally ignored despite instructions to the Vice Chancellors to comply with the guidelines, Mr. Baalu pointed out. According to the letter, in NLU, Bengaluru, there are 120 seats in BA-LLB course, out of which 93 seats are in the General Category while 18 and 9 seats are reserved for SCs and STs respectively, but there is a total denial for OBC candidates. This is the case across various NLUs including in Tiruchirapalli, the letter said. Mr. Baalu said that NLU, Delhi was providing only 22% reservation to OBCs instead of 27%. He also pointed out in June 2020, the chairman of National Commission for Backward Classes had directed the University Grants Commission to take stringent action against NLUs flouting mandatory reservation policies for students belonging to OBCs, while NCBC had issued directions in this regard. Despite these directions, Vice Chancellors of NLUs have refused to comply with the OBC reservation norm, Mr. Baalu alleged, which has put OBC students to great disadvantage. He sought the Minister’s intervention and urged him to direct the UGC and Vice Chancellors of the NLUs to implement 27% reservation for OBCs students for the All-India Seats as well as the State-prescribed domicile reservation for admission in this academic year 2020-21.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-flags-issue-of-law-universities-flouting-obc-reservation-norms/article32824969.ece
11 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Allies must accept CM candidate to remain in front: AIADMK||Days after the AIADMK formalised Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami as its electoral face for 2021, its senior leaders on Saturday made it clear that only alliance parties who accept him as the Chief Ministerial candidate could be part of its front. On Friday, BJP State president L. Murugan had sidestepped questions on whether Mr. Palaniswami’s candidature would have the NDA’s endorsement as well. AIADMK deputy coordinator K.P. Munusamy said the decision to project Mr. Palaniswami as the CM candidate was taken by party functionaries after consultations, and it was the party’s policy decision. “Only when political parties [allies] accept this, they can be in the alliance,” he told The Hindu . When pointed out that some of AIADMK’s alliance parties had not welcomed the decision or had remained ambiguous in endorsing the decision, the Rajya Sabha MP said: “It is not important for us whether they welcome it.” Citing the case of Bihar, where the BJP, despite being a national party, was supporting Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar as the alliance’s CM candidate for the Assembly polls, Mr. Munusamy reasoned, “When the alliance is headed by us, it is natural that the CM candidate will be from our party.” Senior AIADMK leader and former MP A. Anwhar Raajhaa said one must understand what an alliance means in politics. “It is an electoral alliance formed to face an election and it is only for that election. The last agreement with BJP was for the Parliamentary elections and we did not formally seek their support for the bypolls in Nanguneri and Vikravandi Assembly constituencies, but we won,” he pointed out. Though the Central and State governments had been maintaining cordial ties, the alliance would be finalised only closer to the elections. Mr. Raajhaa said he had insisted that the party leadership not to go for what he called a “minus alliance”. “Every party in an electoral alliance should help secure votes for the front, and if the vote bank erodes because of an ally in the front, that is what I call a minus alliance,” he said. He said when the AIADMK lost in 1996, it had about 28% votes, and it was about 33% in 2006, but the party bagged only about 18% votes in the 2019 Parliamentary elections. Asked if the AIADMK subscribed to the BJP’s plan to organise padayathirai to the abodes of Lord Murugan, Mr. Raajhaa said: “The AIADMK government will protect the people’s right to practice religion, but if there are law and order issues, the law will take its course.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/allies-must-accept-cm-candidate-to-remain-in-front-aiadmk/article32824934.ece

After receiving orders on a mobile phone application, the cartel procured the drug from Mumbai, brought it through courier services and supplied it to customers in various parts of the city. The suspects who have been arrested are S. Hussain, 36, of Royapuram; S. Asif Raja, 21, of Tiruvottiyur; and K. Mathi, 35, of Panaiyur. Thirteen grams of MDMA, syringes, three mobile phones, three bikes and cash were seized from them. The police said the main accused Hussain, a native of Gujarat and working in the city as a customer care executive, had befriended the men through an application. He befriended Mathi, who worked in a medical shop, and started giving him the drug to sell and make money, the police said. The police first nabbed Asif Raja, a fashion designer, based on information that he was supplying MDMA in syringes at Thiruvanmiyur. On the basis of his statement, the other two were secured. The three procured MDMA for Rs. 3,000 per gram from Mumbai and sold it here for Rs. 6,000. Steps were taken to nab the main suspect operating from Mumbai, a police officer said. They were booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and remanded in judicial custody. MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy and Molly, alters mood and perception.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drug-cartel-operating-through-mobile-app-unearthed/article32825514.ece
11 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Ensure equitable representation of Dalits in Catholic hierarchy’||With the office of bishops in five Catholic dioceses and one arch-diocese going vacant in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, Dalit Christian bodies have reiterated their demand for appointing Dalits to the posts to ensure their equitable representation in the Catholic hierarchy. At a virtual meeting on Wednesday with the president of the Tamil Nadu Bishops’ Council and Archbishop of Madurai Antony Pappusamy, the bodies pointed out the lack of representation of Dalits in the hierarchy, particularly among bishops. M. Mary John, president, Dalit Christian Liberation Movement, said though Dalits constituted more than 50% of the Catholic population in T.N. and Puducherry, only one of the 18 dioceses of the Latin Catholic rite in Chennai had a Dalit as bishop. Arguing that the first appointment of a Dalit as bishop happened only in 1993, to the Vellore diocese after considerable pressure from Dalit Christian movements, he said three more were appointed and one was elevated as Archbishop in the next 12 years. “However, even this marginal progress towards equitable representation has been reversed in the last 15 years as there has not been even a single Dalit among at least eight bishops and archbishops appointed during the period,” he said. He said the situation was similar across the country. “Though Dalits are a majority among the Catholic community throughout India, only 11 of the roughly 170 bishops are Dalits,” he said. The organisations demanded that Dalits be appointed to all five vacancies in T.N. and Puducherry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ensure-equitable-representation-of-dalits-in-catholic-hierarchy/article32824936.ece

11 October 2020||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Advanced technique helps patients make quick recovery||Sanjay, 54, V. Ramesh, 44, and M. Narmada, 70 — all of whom recovered from a heart attack — are now leading normal lives. All of them had blocks in multiple arteries, requiring bypass surgeries. But they were offered an advanced technique, which reduced their hospital stay to just three to four days. In fact, Mr. Sanjay has returned to work already. They were admitted in the ICU for just a day, and to the regular ward for another day. On the third day, they were discharged and put on a cardio-rehabilitation programme. This was made possible thanks to the hybrid cath lab facility at Kauvery Hospital, said R. Anantharaman, senior consultant interventional cardiologist. Mr. Ramesh had a history of heart attack and blocks in the right and left coronary arteries. His heart was functioning at only 30% of the normal level. Conventionally, such patients would have to undergo a coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, which requires surgeons to open the chest cavity. The surgeon decided to perform a hybrid revascularisation procedure wherein a 3-4 cm incision was made on the left side of the chest and the main bypass grafting for the left coronary artery was done. After checking its functioning through angiography, the surgeon inserted a stent through angioplasty in the right coronary artery.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/advanced-technique-helps-patients-make-quick-recovery/article32825687.ece

The officials said the Senate had suspended the “branch change at the end of the first semester” facility for students enrolling in the 2020-21 academic year. IITs usually allow students to change their branches based on their CGPA at the end of the first semester. “Reinstatement of this facility for incoming students in future academic years will be considered once we are able to re-start normal classes and examinations on campus,” the institute said. The institute said it would permit students of 2020-21 incoming batch to upgrade to a five-year dual degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) within their B. Tech discipline or to an interdisciplinary programme in their fourth or fifth semester. “In the IDDD programmes, the M.Tech degree is an inter-disciplinary field. At present, there are eight IDDD programmes,” the institute said. In respect of IIT Delhi, its Director had recently tweeted, “Many JEE Adv qualified candidates are writing to me saying branch change will not be allowed for them. At @iitdelhi over 100 students are allowed to change their branch every year, based on their 1st year performance. We are indeed trying to make this process even more flexible.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-facility-to-swap-courses-at-iit-m-this-year/article32825509.ece
11 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Most flyers check-in online, get passes from kiosks||Over 50% of air passengers have been opting for web check-in and using kiosks to reduce contact with employees at the airport these past few months after the COVID-19 outbreak. Officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said, “The practice has become the norm now. A majority of passengers own a smartphone and are conscious to avoid any contact with employees inside the airport. So they finish their web check-in at home or office and get e-boarding passes. Otherwise, some just collect the passes at kiosks outside the airport terminal. This saves a lot of time for them and also reduces congestion,” an official said. Only those who carry a check-in baggage have to necessarily stand in queue for the security scan. However, a baggage tag was no longer used, and passengers instead received an identification number by SMS, officials said. “Of course, there are passengers who do not own a smartphone or do not have the facility for web check-ins. They are assisted at the entry points by airline staff to fill up self-declaration forms for COVID-19 and then issued boarding passes. Some also go to the counter inside the terminal for the passes,” he added. The number of passengers now ranges between 12,000 and 14,000 a day with an increase during the weekends and a mild dip during the middle of the week. “But it has certainly gotten better with time and we hope it will touch 18,000-20,000 a day when the number of flights operated goes up to 200-250 a day. Currently, 130-140 flights are operated per day,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/most-flyers-check-in-online-use-kiosks-for-boarding-passes/article32825501.ece
11 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC permits Govt. to go ahead with auctioning of lands for mining black granite||The Madras High Court has permitted the State government to go ahead and confirm in favour of the highest bidders the recent auctioning of various government lands in Dharmapuri district for mining black granite. Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha also permitted the government to ask the highest bidders to submit mining plans, get them approved and then obtain environment clearance too in accordance with existing rules. The permission was granted at the request of Advocate General Vijay Narayan who said the State government would end up losing hundreds of crores of rupees in foreign exchange and also employment opportunities for many if the auctions were stalled. The A-G urged the court to modify an interim order passed by another Division Bench on September 30 restraining the government from confirming the auction. He said only if the auctions were confirmed the consequent process of environment clearance could be taken up. The interim order was passed on a couple of public interest litigation petitions which insisted that environmental clearance must be obtained even before deciding to auction the lands. They also relied upon Central government guidelines to substantiate their case. However, Mr. Narayan told the court that the guidelines cited by the petitioners were related to ease of doing business and had nothing to do with environment. He said the onus of obtaining environmental clearance was upon the successful bidders now as per existing rules. The Centre wanted a change in such a procedure and go in for a pre-embedded clearance where lands could be leased out to the miners after obtaining all statutory clearances. This guideline of the Centre had absolutely nothing to do with environment, he said. Pointing out that one of the two PIL petitioners, who had challenged the tender notifications, was former Member of Parliament R. Thamaraiselvan, the A-G said: “It is a bit unfair on the part of the former MP to make it an environment issue.” After hearing him at length, the Bench led by Justice Sathyanarayanan modified the interim order passed by the previous Bench and permitted the government to go ahead with all other processes except those for executing the lease deeds and handing over the lands to the lessors. Final hearing They also said that the PILs would be taken up for final hearing on November 3. The senior judge in the Bench said sustainable development should be the mantra in the country where both development as well as environment protection must happen together.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-permits-govt-to-go-ahead-with-auctioning-of-lands-for-mining-black-granite/article32824996.ece

11 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Urban homeless seek houses||On the occasion of World Homeless Day on October 10, the urban homeless families living in north Chennai have sent a petition to the Greater Chennai Corporation seeking permanent housing. They said they had been subjected to untold suffering during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are over 1,800 homeless families living in Royapuram, Parry’s and Mannady for the past 60 years. “The pavements are our refuge, be it under the scorching sun or pouring rain. We do not have any safety and our children find it hard to study. We have been constantly requesting the government to provide us with houses in the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) tenements in Moolakothalam. But the TNSCB wants 10% contribution from our side — we are ready to give it but on an instalment basis,” said A. Sarasa, one of the petitioners, who lives on Stringer Street. Many said during the pandemic, their families suffered due to a lack of food. “We did not have any work. So we had to rely on NGOs for food. Besides, we have to use public toilets and we are prone to contracting virus. Already a few pavement dwellers in Egmore have tested positive,” said Leelavathy, residing on Davidson Street.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/urban-homeless-seek-houses/article32825515.ece

At a media interaction, when asked whether the smaller parties in the DMK-led alliance would contest on the latter’s ‘Rising Sun’ symbol, Mr. Vaiko said, “There is no scope for such talks. The MDMK would contest with its individuality. MDMK will get its own symbol and contest in that symbol.” In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, MDMK candidate C. Ganesamoorthy was elected on the DMK’s symbol from Erode. Mr. Vaiko felt the DMK-led alliance in Tamil Nadu remained strong and continued to remain together in its goals and was determined that the ruling AIADMK should be removed from power.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mdmk-will-contest-2021-polls-on-its-symbol-vaiko/article32824929.ece

According to Saravanan, a clay doll-maker, there are no buyers from Kerala, this year. "Usually, by now, I would have sold 70 % of the dolls. This year, it is just 20% of the usual sales," he said. Since he makes the dolls involving mainly his family members, lockdown restrictions did not affect the production process. "We did not stop work. We kept making the dolls. But, the sales are down," he said. Mr. Saravanan says online marketing is difficult for clay dolls. "There are possibilities of damages and I will have to answer customers for that," he says. At Poompuhar, 21 artisans have put up stalls. It is less than 50% sales compared to the same period last year. The artisans say sales is average this year as customer walk-ins are few. With the spread of COVID-19, customers are reluctant to come to the stores, say sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pandemic-hits-sale-of-kolu-dolls/article32825527.ece

Some of the temples that remained closed included the Karamadai Aranganathaswamy Temple, Ukkadam Lakshmi Narasimha Temple and Anumantharaaya Swamy Temple in Idugampalayam in Coimbatore district and Mondipalayam Venkatesa Perumal Temple in Tiruppur district. Rituals conducted Sources in the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department said that the temples have been witnessing steady crowds in spite of the COVID-19 situation during the past Puratasi Saturdays. However, regular rituals for the deities were conducted in the temples, the sources added. Coimbatore district administration had previously announced that Karamadai Aranganathaswamy Temple will remain closed for devotees on October 3, 10 and 17 due to the possibility of “being unable to completely adhere to the standard operating procedures.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vishnu-temples-remain-closed-in-coimbatore-tiruppur-districts/article32824978.ece
11 October 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||‘Detection of more positive cases helps prevent infection spread’||The measures it has put in place in the city last few days has helped detect more COVID-19 positive cases, particularly that of asymptomatic persons, says the Coimbatore Corporation. As of September 29, the city had 3,372 active COVID-19 cases. And, as of October 9, this increased to 3,673 cases. The increase in number has to do with the Corporation increasing the number of samples and taking steps for early detection of cases, says Corporation Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian. Though the number has increased, it has helped contain the spread of the disease as can be seen from the increase in number of streets that are free of COVID-19 cases – from 5,876 streets to 5,986 streets. This means that the Corporation has been detecting more cases. Most of the cases are of persons who show no symptoms and this detection is at a very early stage of infection, thanks to the door-to-door survey that the Corporation is carrying out, the Commissioner explains. He says the Corporation has covered two times almost every household in the city in the door-to-door survey, aimed at identifying people with influenza-like infection or COVID-19 symptoms. On identification of such persons, the door-to-door surveyors inform the medical team concerned. The team then lifts samples for testing. This along with fever camps has helped contain the spread, the Commissioner says and adds that very soon the city will see a reduction in number of active cases. City Health Officer S. Raja says the Corporation conducting around 100 fever clinics a day for the last three months has also helped identify people with fever symptoms and keep a tab on people prone to infection. And, the Corporation reverting to quarantining areas with positive cases has curtailed the movement of people within the containment zone and prevented others from entering such zones, he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/detection-of-more-positive-cases-helps-prevent-infection-spread/article32825526.ece
11 October 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||BU research scholars oppose fee hike||Revision in fee for Ph.D. programmes by the Bharathiar University has invited backlash from researchers, who say the research programme is going beyond the reach of students from economically weaker section. The University, based on a Syndicate decision, revised upwards the fee for submission of synopsis, thesis, revision and re-submission of thesis and issue of provisional certificate for the researchers. Opposing the move, a researcher said the University revising from Rs. 3,500 to Rs. 6,000 the fee for synopsis submission was unfair as only a year ago it had revised the fee from Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 3,500. Likewise, it had revised the fee for thesis submission to Rs. 18,000 and re-submission to Rs. 18,000. And, on top of that it had revised the provisional certificate fee to Rs. 3,000. There appeared to be no rationale for a State-funded University like the Bharathiar University to revise the fee for researchers. This would only make Ph.D. an expensive programme and not many would want to pursue research. A few research scholars also staged a protest. Defending the decision, Vice Chancellor P. Kaliraj said the revision in fee for thesis submission and re-submission was because of the increase in fee to be paid to foreign examiner. The University has a system whereby it sends a copy of each Ph.D. thesis to a foreign examiner. The University spends around US Dollar 150 – US Dollar 200 for a thesis evaluation by a foreign examiner. And, this excludes postal and other charges. What the University had done by way of the fee revision was only cut down its loses. Besides, the revision was applicable for candidates who would apply for admission to Ph.D programme in the academic year 2021-22 and they would be paying the fee three or four years thereafter, at the time of completion of their research. Therefore, the current students who had staged the protest, would in no way be affected, Mr. Kaliraj added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bu-research-scholars-oppose-fee-hike/article32825536.ece

Ramaswamy launched a campaign for voter awareness in Coimbatore on Saturday. As part of the campaign organised by Nallatchi Iyakkam (Good Governance Movement), he issued to motorists on Bharathi Park Road in Saibaba Colony pamphlets containing messages on the importance of voting for “qualified” candidates. “The public must vote for the right candidate without bias for any party,” he told The Hindu , noting that Nallatchi Iyakkam stresses that every party has qualified candidates. “If there are no such candidates in any party, they must vote for an independent candidate. If no other option is available, they must opt for NOTA (none of the above),” Mr. Ramaswamy said. The 87-year-old activist will travel to Dharapuram in Tiruppur district on Sunday to carry out the campaign. Mr. Ramaswamy plans to cover the entire State before the campaign for the election begins.

The action was taken against forest range officer S. Suresh and the two others after an inquiry by a special team of the department. The officials had imposed a fine of Rs. 10,000 each on two women namely N. Indirani and R. Shanthamani from Avvai Nagar at Naickenpalayam for possessing meat of spotted deer on September 29. The women, who worked in a grove belonging to a popular south Indian actor’s sister at Palamalai foothills, had confessed to the officers that they procured the meat of the deer that was found dead half a kilometer from the grove. After allegations came up that the officers spared a few others involved in the offence, the District Forest Officer formed a special team for inquiry. The team found that four more women and seven men were involved in the wildlife offence. The department collected a total fine of Rs. 1 lakh from the 13 persons. Senior officials with the department said Mr. Suresh was transferred to the social forestry section at Periyanaickenpalayam. They also said that the officer had already requested for a transfer within the division.

The hospital said a 36-year-old woman was brought in after she tested positive for COVID-19 when she was admitted earlier to a private hospital in her home district of Tiruppur. Doctors at the ESI Hospital here found that the woman had a fibroid weighing around 1 kg. They were surprised that despite the presence of a large fibroid she was in the ninth month of pregnancy and the baby was normal. It was her third baby and the first two deliveries were normal. The doctors, however, decided that this time it should be a Caesarian section as the fibroid might cause obstruction during labour. A female baby weighing 2.75 kg was taken out through the procedure on September 19. Hospital Dean A. Nirmala said the fibroid was not removed at the time of the Caesarean section as doctors feared it could lead to profuse blood loss. “Removal of the fibroid was not an emergency. It can be removed later,” she said. The mother and baby were in special care and they got discharged after testing negative for COVID-19 on September 29, said the hospital administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/caesarian-performed-on-covid-19-patient-with-large-fibroid/article32825531.ece

The market with over 700 shops functions from evening to the next day morning and is visited by hundreds of shopkeepers, retailers and public everyday. After the premises turned slushy during the rainy season, the Corporation closed the market from October 7 to 9 and tar-topped the premises. On Saturday, the market was reopened. But the rain on Friday night led to stagnation of water on the premises. Traders have sought for drainage facility on the premises to prevent the problem. The district received widespread rainfall on Friday night, with Modakurichi receiving the maximum of 60 mm. Rainfall recorded at other places were Erode 38 mm, Perundurai 26 mm, Gobichettipalayam 27.8 mm, Talavadi 21 mm, Bhavani Sagar 38.2 mm, Bhavani 40 mm, Kodumudi 38.2 mm, Elanthakuttai Medu 28.4 mm, Ammapettai 41.6 m and Gunderipallam 38.2mm. Heavy rain accompanied by strong winds damaged standing banana crops in over 40 acre in Anthiyur Taluk.

A total of 630 farmers have registered with the market run by the Department of Agricultural Marketing. The market functions from 5.30 a.m. to 8 a.m. every day. Farmers from many parts of the district bring their produce and sell it to the public directly. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, absence of public transportation and cultivation of paddy, less than 150 farmers turn up with their produce now. Public complained that traders bought the vegetables from farmers and sold it outside the market for higher price. “There are over 50 shops outside the market where traders sell vegetables at a higher price,” said V. Sampath of Chinnamuthu Street. Shops set up on both sides of the road leave little space for the public to move to the market, forcing them to buy vegetables from the traders. “Vegetables are not available in the market  after 7 p.m., while they are available with the traders after that,” said Jothi Priya of Sampath Nagar. She wanted the encroachments removed so that the public can access the market without difficulty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-want-shops-set-up-outside-uzhavar-sandhai-regulated/article32824990.ece
11 October 2020||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Families return to settlement in STR, take up MGNREGS works||The Kembanur tribal settlement in the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR) earlier had just three inhabitants. Now, 18 families, which have taken up farming and other works under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), reside here. The settlement, located about 12 km from the Athani–Sathyamangalam Road, falls under the Kongarpalayam panchayat in the T.N. Palayam Panchayat Union in Gobichettipalayam Taluk. Some 10 years ago, over 50 families, all belonging to the Urali community, left for Kembanur Colony, located outside the forest area in Vinoba Nagar. They went in search of jobs and better education opportunities. But three residents stayed put, all through these years, cultivating millets in their small holdings. Hit by lockdown With the COVID-19 lockdown in place, most relocated families could not find jobs, even as the closure of schools were an added burden. Eighteen families — over 55 persons — returned to the settlement and constructed huts and took up farming. “We were given conditional pattas for the land and we cultivated maize, groundnut, ragi, other millets and a variety of paddy that can grow without water,” said Maniyal, 37. As many as 23 people were provided jobs to construct stone bunds in the fields, under the MGNREGS, and were assured of an income in the last two months. “It is our only income and we purchase essentials and other things with the money,” she said. Though the daily wage was fixed at Rs. 256, workers were unaware of the amount they would be paid. “For 15 days’ work, we recently withdrew Rs. 1,000,” said Ammasai, 45. This is the first time that works under the scheme have been carried out in the settlement, providing income to the families, she said. M. Srirangan, 71, the oldest person in the settlement, said since more families had returned to their native place, the government should establish a school, improve the roads and provide essentials through a mobile ration shop regularly. “Elephants, wild boar, buffaloes and bear stray onto our fields, damaging crops, and, hence, we need trenches to be dug,” he added. There are over 40 children in the hamlet, and the presence of wild animals on the 6-km non-motorable route to Vilankombai or Vinoba Nagar will make it difficult for them to pursue studies. “We have been living here for over two centuries and a school will ensure that we produce graduates in the coming years,” said Mr. Srirangan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/families-return-to-settlement-in-str-take-up-mgnregs-works/article32824940.ece

11 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Strengthen vigilance wing in the judiciary’||Justice S.M. Subramaniam of the Madras High Court (Madurai Bench) has called upon the judiciary to strengthen its vigilance wing to crush corrupt practices. Building citizens’ confidence in the judiciary is the constitutional mandate, he said and added, “Doubts in the minds of the citizens will lead to destruction of the constitutional principles. Undoubtedly, the judiciary has to strengthen its vigilance wing and the prevailing vigilance system in the judiciary is insufficient to crush corrupt practices,” the judge said during the course of hearing in a case. “Corruption is the devil in society,” he said referring to corrupt practices in the administration of government departments but added, “This court has to endorse the fact that the judiciary is also not exempt from corrupt practices.” Justice Subramaniam observed that the conscience of the court would not permit if it fails to mention the increasing corrupt practices in the judiciary as well as on the court premises. Justice requires equal treatment of all the citizens and consistency in the justice delivery system. Further, the judge pointed out that many former Chief Justices of India had lamented that the judiciary was not exempt from corrupt practices. Unfortunately, efficient measures were yet to be taken to deal with many kinds of corrupt practices in the judicial system, the judge strongly observed in his order. The Department of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption needs to be strengthened to a greater extent to ensure periodical surprise inspections and raids to deal with corrupt practices in public services, the judge said. He hoped that the observations would be taken in the right manner to develop an effective and efficient system. The court was hearing a petition filed by N. Ulagaraj from Tirunelveli, an office assistant in the Registration Department. He challenged the punishment of compulsory retirement awarded to him on the charge of receiving bribe with regard to registration of sale deeds. The court said that the petition was devoid of merit and dismissed it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/strengthen-vigilance-wing-in-the-judiciary/article32824955.ece
11 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||High Court issues guidelines for conducting property survey||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has laid down guidelines for the authorities to follow while conducting property surveys. It also wanted government officials held accountable for failure in their duty while conducting these surveys. Justice S. Vaidyanathan observed, “We are now in the era of global digitalisation and by use of advanced technology/machinery, the survey could be easily done so as to bring the issue to a logical conclusion to the satisfaction of both parties.” The court said a survey or resurvey should be conducted within 30 days of receipt of charges, and the entire process should be photographed and videographed. In case of failure on the part of an official to conduct a survey, the cost of application should be returned to the parties, a sum of Rs. 2,500 should be recovered from the salary of the official and departmental proceedings should be initiated against him/her. A register should be maintained with details such as the name of the person who has gone for the survey, the area of survey, the date of survey, the completion of survey, and the reason for not surveying the property. The facts should be verified by a superior officer. Constant vigil The judge said the details should be made available to the parties concerned or any person under the Right to Information Act. A constant vigil of officials of the Revenue Department was necessary to regulate revenue-related works, he said. The district administration should use drone technology to conduct an accurate survey of properties, which would help to bring out encroachments on government land, the court said. Pendency of litigation would not bar the authorities from conducting a survey or resurvey in the absence of any stay or an interim order or an interim injunction, the judge said. The judge said it was unfortunate that officials were demanding bribes even for doing their duties, and directed the State to issue a circular within a month, incorporating these guidelines. The court was hearing a petition filed by Asaithambi of Madurai. Taking into account the delay in the conduct of a survey of the property involved, the court passed the guidelines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-issues-guidelines-for-property-survey/article32824905.ece

11 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||MP wants CPRF to set up exam centre in T.N. and Puducherry||Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan has urged A.P. Maheswari, Director General of Central Reserve Police Force, to set up at least one examination centre each in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry to enable job aspirants to appear for written examination for CRPF Paramedical Staff Examination – 2020 on August 31. In a memorandum sent on Saturday, he expressed his disappointment that none of the nine centres planned across India was in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. The CRPF has issued a notification calling for applications for 24 posts of Group ‘B’ and ‘C’ non-ministerial, non-gazetted, combatised staff on all-India basis with the last date of application on August 31. The total declared vacancies are around 780 and the date of written examination has been fixed on December 20. The MP said that the notification had listed only nine centres for examination. Among them, five are in northern states, two in southern States, one each in western and eastern parts of India. “I do not find anything wrong in having five centres in northern States. But, equity is not there for other parts of country in distribution of examination centres. Shockingly, there is no examination centre in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,” he said. This unequal distribution would put candidates from Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in a great difficulty in view of Covid 19 and movement of people is a risk. This should not be a deterrent for aspirants for competing for the posts declared. The MP urged the DG to increase the examination centres and ensure proper distribution to all parts of the country. As the last date to submit applications is over, he also requested the DG to extend the last date by one month from the date of revised notification to accommodate new applications in view of changes in original notification.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mp-wants-cprf-to-set-up-exam-centre-in-tn-puducherry/article32825616.ece

11 October 2020||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||Micro-organisms sprayed to clear Mettur water spread area of algae||Work has begun to contain algae in the water spread area of Mettur Dam by spraying effective micro-organisms (EM). Villagers along the water spread area have been complaining of foul odour from the algae. Officials from departments such as fisheries, agriculture, revenue and PWD are involved in the activity to spray effective micro-organisms to treat the foul odour and stop growth of algae. The treatment may continue up to one month considering the spread of algae in various parts of the water spread area of the dam. Senior revenue officials said the algae might have been formed due to insecticides and fertilizers used by farmers who had taken up farming along the contour area. Senior officials from the agriculture department said that the EM would not affect the quality of water or contaminate them in any manner. The treatment activities were recently started near Banawadi here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/micro-organisms-sprayed-to-clear-mettur-water-spread-area-of-algae/article32824992.ece

11 October 2020||Thoothukudi,TAMIL NADU||Use degradable waste to prepare manure, households told||The Corporation has introduced a novel scheme of converting degradable waste generated in households into manure in the houses itself under its ‘Bio Net’ scheme. As degradable and non-degradable garbage are being collected separately from houses under the ‘source segregation’ scheme introduced by the Corporation a couple of years ago, the degradable waste is being taken to the micro compost centres where it is converted into manure to be distributed back to the public for using it in their homestead gardens. To take this scheme to the next level, the Corporation has introduced the system of converting the biodegradable waste getting generated in the houses into manure in the houses itself. Besides significantly reducing the short-staffed Corporation’s burden, the move is expected to encourage the public to prepare the manure in their houses itself with the degradable waste of their houses. As per the instructions of Corporation Commissioner V. P. Jayaseelan, City Health Officer Arunkumar formally inaugurated the programme in ten houses in Chinnamani Nagar area in Millerpuram on Friday on trial basis. The process According to this programme, a 3-feet-tall ‘tree guard’ like metal cage would be kept in the house for putting the degradable waste in it. Either effective micro organisms solution or water should be sprinkled on the degradable garbage kept inside the metal cage to facilitate early chemical and biological degrading. On the 46th day, manure will be ready for use. “If a house generates 1 kg to 1.50 kg degradable waste a day, this waste management system will be very effective for them to make manure. The metal cage cost of Rs. 350 should be borne by the user,” said Dr. Arunkumar. As the scheme was launched on ‘pilot basis’ in Chinnamani Nagar on Friday, the residents showed much interest in it and hence the Corporation has planned to extend it to other areas of the west zone, housing significant number of middle class families.  If a house generates 1 kg to 1.50 kg degradable waste a day, this waste management system will be very effective for them to make manure Arunkumar City Health Officer||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/use-degradable-waste-to-prepare-manure-households-told/article32825753.ece
11 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Fish market opens amid discontent among traders||The new fish market at Kasivilangi on Woraiyur-Kuzhumani Road on the outskirts of the city became fully operational on Saturday with traders shifting their operations from the old market at Puthur. Confusion and chaos marked day one of full fledged trading at the new market. While the traders, who were allotted shops at the new market, started doing business, others, who had been operating on pavements at the old market, were left disappointed. Faced with loss of livelihood , they gathered at the new market and discussed the future course of action. Many of them expressed concern that Corporation officials had failed to accommodate all traders. They said the civic body should have constructed the new market by taking into account the interest of all traders, including those operating on pavements. It is alleged that some of the original allottees, who had been trading at Cooni Bazaar and subsequently at Puthur, had not been allotted shops at the new market. While those who were allotted wholesale shops expressed satisfaction over the size of the shops, retail traders complained that the space was not sufficient to do trading as well as stocking unsold goods. “The new market meets the needs of only a section of traders. Many others have been left in the lurch. Their livelihood is at stake now,” said T.K. Bawa, one of the traders. The traders said the new market had nine wholesale shops and 25 retail shops. It meant that it had accommodated 39 traders. An equal number of traders of the old market were said to have been left without shops. They demanded that the Corporation should construct an additional building adjacent to the new market so as to accommodate the left-out traders. The day witnessed heavy traffic snarls on Woraiyur-Kuzhumani road as a large number of customers thronged the new market to buy fish. Haphazard parking of vehicles prevented free flow of vehicles. The battered road, dotted with potholes, also slowed down the movement of vehicles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fish-market-opens-amid-discontent-among-traders/article32824945.ece
11 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Call for better maintenance of Mavadikulam||A section of residents and activists staged a protest on Saturday demanding proper maintenance and development of the Mavadikulam in Ponmalai. The residents alleged that the waterbody has not been desilted properly. “Waste water coming from residences and commercial establishments across Ponmalai is contaminating the lake. Garbage is dumped into the lake. If the authorities want to improve the lake, they must first ensure that the water is not contaminated,” said K. Sathish Kumar, joint secretary of Thanneer, a voluntary organisation. The lake used to be a sanctuary for migratory birds but many species did not return after 2017 due to the state of the lake, Mr. Satish claimed. “Although we often mobilise volunteers and students to clean the lake, the rate at which it was being contaminated is much higher,” he said. The protesters said desilting should be done properly. Otherwise, they would stage protests on a bigger scale. According to the proposal drawn up by the Public Works Department, the lake bund is to be strengthened. A walkway and a road would be laid around the lake. A bathing ghat and seating arrangements and four mounds for birds to perch have been planned. The authorities claim that the waterbody was desilted before the work on the facilities began. “We get requests to allow boating and other entertainment features. However, Mavadikulam is primarily used as an irrigation channel and we would like to preserve it this way. People can walk around it and take in its beauty,” an Assistant Engineer of the PWD from Chennai who has been assigned to monitor the work said. The mounds will have saplings, specially brought from the Agriculture department for this purpose so that birds can nest on them, the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruchi-residents-call-for-better-maintenance-of-mavadikulam/article32824922.ece

11 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||15,000 saplings planted under Miyawaki method||Volunteers, social activists and employees of various departments joined hands on Saturday to plant about 15,000 saplings at Lalgudi. The urban forestry initiative is being undertaken on the Japanese model of Miyawaki, a model of raising dense forest in an urban environment. It is second major initiative after the successful raising of a dense forest in Srirangam on the land owned by Sri Ranganathaswami Temple, where 10,000 plants of various varieties have been raised. The new initiative comes up on 6,600 square metres on a vacant site owned by the Southern Railway between the bus stand and railway station at Lalgudi. S. Vaidhyanathan, Revenue Divisional Officer, Lalgudi, who had played a key role in mobilising men and materials to set up the urban forestry initiative in Srirangam when he was an Assistant Commissioner of Tiruchi Corporation, has replicated the idea in Lalgudi with a few modifications. Lalgudi-based Navaneedha Krishna Textiles and Thanga Maaligai and KNR Constructions are the sponsors. The town panchayat would maintain the plot. Collector S. Sivarasu launched the initiative by planting a sapling in the presence of senior officials of the district administration and the railways. “It is a good initiative. The site will become a mini shola forest in the town within two to three months. It will enable the people living near the project site to inhale pure air. They can feel a forest environment in the town,” said Mr. Sivarasu. Mr. Vaidhyanathan said 57 types of various tree species had been planted. Unlike the traditional system, three or four saplings had been planted for every one square metre. The saplings would be irrigated with drip irrigation. Only organic fertilizers had been used to raise the plants. There was a provision for people to go for walking through the forest, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/15000-saplings-planted-under-miyawaki-method/article32824946.ece

11 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Farmers get hands-on training in applying TNAU Cotton Plus||The Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Sirugumani, organised a field demonstrations on application of TNAU Cotton Plus, a micro nutrient yield booster, to help cotton farmers get a better yield. Tamil Nadu Agriculture University has introduced the TNAU Cotton Plus containing important crop-specific micro nutrients with growth promoter substances for getting more yield in cotton. In Tiruchi district, cotton was cultivated in 13,000 hectares, producing about 24,000 million tonnes of cotton fibre. Of this, nearly 95% is rain-fed area where most farmers use high-yielding hybrid varieties. However, low soil fertility, less plant population, nutrient deficiencies, flower dropping, boll shedding, pest and disease reduce 20-30% of yield, a KVK press release said. To overcome yield loss in cotton due to nutrient deficiency, TNAU Cotton Plus can be applied. To popularise and explore the importance of the crop booster among farmers, field demonstrations were organised by V. Dhanushkodi, Assistant Professor, KVK, Sirugamani, at Nettavelanpatti and Pachaperumalpatti in Uppilliyapuram block recently. Farmers were explained how to dissolve TNAU Cotton Plus in water and spray it on the crop at flowering stage. Foliar spray was also recommended at boll formation stage.

As part of the plan to protect the statues of leaders from desecration by anti social elements, the Tiruchi Corporation on Saturday began erecting a fence around Periyar statues. The statue at Srirangam was also part of it. However, the DK cadres, who came to know it, assembled in front of the statue in Srirangam and opposed the move. Collector S. Sivarasu said that the move was aimed at protecting the statues from vandals. All the nine Periyar statues in Samathuvapuram in the district had been protected with fences. Since the DK cadres had expressed reservations against erecting fence around the Periyar statue in Srirangam, it had been halted temporarily.

Alleging that she had been a victim of caste discrimination ever since she was elected the president in January, Ms. Saravana Kumar said Mohan Raj and three other ward members did not allow her to function independently. “I was not allowed to hoist the national flag during the Republic Day in January. The panchayat vice-president said his father would hoist the flag instead. He and three other ward members, all caste Hindus, insulted me and forced me and the other Dalit ward member, Suganthi, to sit on the floor at meetings, while the rest sat on chairs,” she said. Ms. Saravana Kumar alleged that she had not been allowed to occupy her seat at the panchayat office. This had happened at the last three meetings, and the reason they had cited was that an adequate number of chairs was not available, she said. In the larger interest of serving the people, she had been bearing with the insult and disrespect. “The situation has now reached a point where continued silence would only strengthen their attitude, and hence I have decided to speak out,” she said. The panchayat meetings were convened only by the vice-president, who maintained that “I am a woman and know nothing and should remain quiet,” she said. She added that he had dared her to lodge a complaint with any authority. A senior official said caste-based discrimination was prevailing in the panchayat for some time. But he rejected her charge that she was not allowed to hoist the flag on Republic Day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dalit-president-forced-to-sit-on-floor/article32824932.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Housing policy: noble intentions, but improvements needed||After staying long in the making, the first Tamil Nadu Affordable Urban Housing and Habitat Policy has been finally notified and it has been in the public realm for a few weeks now. Coming as it does, at a time when housing prices are steeply increasing, and owning or renting a house is possible only in far peripheries, the policy is a significant step. It has noble intentions and expands housing possibilities, including transit and rental housing for migrant workers. While this is a plus, in the absence of any reliable stock-taking, a clear statement of the problem and reassuring solutions, there are serious questions about the policy’s effectiveness. Avowed objectives of the policy are three — first, the government will henceforth provide housing only for the very poor and ease its financial burden; second, it will nudge the private sector to provide affordable housing for the low and middle-income groups, particularly rental units; and third, using a shelter fund as a critical financial tool, it will support private developers to provide affordable housing and create a viable market for them. The policy rightly identifies that, besides building units, affordable housing, economically, requires the provision of social amenities, built sustainably and designed for climate resilience. The ideas appear significant, but the problem is that they flounder on the fundamentals. A policy on affordable housing would usually first define affordability, estimate the demand and supply, work out the shortage, and spell out strategies to bridge them. However, the Tamil Nadu policy fails on this count. In the absence of a factual basis, a quantification of the problem and empirical measures to review the policy outcomes, good intentions could remain mere platitudes. The fundamentals Housing studies show that four factors affect affordability — the price of the house and income of the buyer; unit size; location; and availability of serviced land. The price-to-income ratio, in case of ownership, and rent-to-income in case of rental housing indicates how much an income group can pay for housing. When the ratio exceeds four in case of purchase or 30% of monthly income in case of renting, the house becomes unaffordable for lower-income groups. Over the last five years, in Chennai, as the previous year’s RBI study shows, this ratio has been increasing, making housing less and less affordable. How does the new policy address this fundamental problem? It is silent. Not that the State is unaware of it. A draft housing policy study note in 2018 listed affordability housing prices for many districts. For example, in Chennai and Tiruvannamalai, where the median annual income of a household is Rs. 3.5 lakh and Rs. 2.25 lakh respectively, the affordable housing price is about Rs. 14 lakh and Rs. 9 lakh. Secondly, it ignores the vast differences between cities, and appears to view the entire State through the lens of Chennai. A related issue is the scale of the housing problem. For instance, at Rs. 14 lakh as the affordability price in Chennai, about 56% of households or 7.55 lakh households are below the mark. Hence, it becomes imperative to estimate the housing demand and supply, against each income group, and work out strategies accordingly.  On the face of it, the three policy objectives appear meaningful. However, they seem to overlook ground realities. The State has decided to limit its direct provisions only to the economically-weaker sections (EWS), leaving out the lower-income groups (LIG). It will become evident, when the income figures are considered, that LIG also deserves equal attention. A study by MIDS in 2019, to which the author contributed, shows that the affordable housing price for LIG is about Rs. 16 lakh. Even if we assume personal savings could be mobilised, prices above Rs. 18 lakh-Rs. 20 lakh, or rent beyond Rs. 10,000 would be unaffordable. For the rest of Tamil Nadu, the figures would be a lot lower. The MIDS study also shows that in Chennai, private builders find Rs. 30 lakh-Rs. 50 lakh as the lowest financially viable price segment to build, that too at a distance. Rentals within the city and close to job markets are steep. The policy seems to think that through financial incentives and higher FSI, it can convince private developers to supply houses at around Rs. 20 lakh, and that will lead to lower rents. This is going to be difficult, as the study mentioned above points out, as the FSI increase from 1.5 to 2 has had a marginal impact. Relatively low interest rates also will have a limited influence on price. A thriving, high-priced housing market requires more efforts. Shelter fund The policy holds the creation of a shelter fund as one of its flagship ideas. The government proposes tier I, a government-controlled fund, and tier II, an alternate investment fund, made up of contributions from the State and potential investors. Both are meant to enhance investment in affordable housing. The tier-I fund is not entirely a new proposal. Since 2017, the government has provided an option for paying shelter charges for private projects exceeding 3,000 sq m, in place of reserving housing units for low-income groups. So far, it has collected about Rs. 181 crore. Not much has happened with this fund. When it comes to tier-II fund, meant to support private builders to take up mixed-income housing, there are no details about utilisation, selection of developers for funding and guarantees that the housing produced will be sold at affordable prices. To make the policy useful and practical, data on housing demand and supply must be compiled, affordability has to be defined and shortage estimated. Besides price, parameters such as location, unit size and job markets are to be factored in. Demand-side support, particularly to LIG is necessary. Land is central to addressing the affordable housing issue, and extensive investment in peri-urban areas to enhance the supply of serviced land is critical. Improvements can be made to transparency and public consultations, since as much as an acceptable policy, one also needs credible processes leading to it.

11 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Govt. temporarily halts ‘Vidyagama’||The State government on Saturday temporarily stopped its ambitious Vidyagama scheme, under which government school teachers visited students in their neighbourhoods. The move came after allegations that the initiative was putting families at risk of contracting COVID-19. The scheme, a continuous learning plan for children, was launched around two months ago to help students in rural areas and those from lower socio-economic sections of society, a majority of whom do not have access to the Internet or smart phones. However, since its launch, there has been opposition from some quarters. Recently, communities in M. Thimmapur village near Ramdurg said that 30 students had tested positive for COVID-19 over the past few days. They alleged that the students had contracted the virus while attending classes conducted by teachers in open public spaces as part of the Vidyagama scheme. Private school managements too have taken umbrage over the scheme, accusing the government of “double standards” as they have been denied permission to resume classes or allow students to visit the schools to get their doubts clarified. Minister for Primary and Secondary Education Suresh Kumar announced that officials have been directed to stop implementing the scheme until a proper analysis of its pros and cons is completed. “It has not been confirmed that teachers and students have been exposed to COVID-19 because of the scheme. Vidyagama was planned scientifically keeping in mind the overall development of children,” he said, hailing it as a model programme in the country. Around 47 lakh students studying in government schools across the State, mostly from the underprivileged sections, are covered under the scheme. The department will collect information from all districts on whether the virus has spread to children from teachers and vice-versa. “The next course of action will be decided based on the reports from the districts,” the Minister said. Opinion divided The Vidyagama programme has received a mixed response and the jury is still out on its benefits. Prominent among those opposing the scheme is former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy. In a series of tweets, he alleged that the State government was risking the lives of both teachers and students. Concurring, Basavaraj Gurikar, president of Karnataka State Primary School Teachers’ Association, said the scheme should be scrapped. “Nothing is more important than the health of children. The government should focus on health, rather than implement such schemes that only risk the lives of teachers and students,” he said.    However, many government school principals are batting for the scheme. The principal of a government high school in Belagavi commended the programme, saying it had helped bridge the learning gap in children. V.P. Niranjan Aradhya from the Centre for Child and Law, National Law School of India University, batted for the reopening of government schools. “If Vidyagama was the reason for the spread of COVID-19, aren’t malls, cinemas, hotels, restaurants, bars, government offices, which the government has permitted to function, also responsible?” he asked. Through Vidyagama, apart from continuous learning, children belonging to poor socio-economic backgrounds received nutrition and health benefits as well. “These children were given meals, milk, vitamin tablets and even health check-up for their overall development,” he said.  V.P. Niranjan Aradhya from the Centre for Child and Law, National Law School of India University: “If Vidyagama was the reason for spread of COVID-19, aren’t malls, cinemas, hotels, restaurants, bars, government offices, which the government has permitted to function, also responsible.” Minister for Primary and Secondary Education Suresh Kumar: “It has not been confirmed that due to the scheme, teachers and students have been exposed to COVID-19.

11 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Karnataka ranks third in attracting investments in Q2||Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the flow of investments into Karnataka in the second quarter of this financial year stood at Rs. 19,959 crore, which enabled the State to secure the third place across States in terms of quantum. In terms of number of projects, the State secured first place with 287. Speaking to The Hindu, Major Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar said the government has cleared investments entailing Rs. 22,000 crore in August-September. During January-July 2020, total fresh investments in the country stood at Rs. 2.87 lakh crore and Karnataka alone bagged 1.16 lakh crore investments, constituting 40% of the total investments, Mr. Shettar said. He attributed it to measures such as amendments to 18-year-old Karnataka Industries (Facilitation) Act, new industrial policy and a host of other policy and administrative measures that made Karnataka ‘one of the attractive destinations’. The changes in the Karnataka Industries (Facilitation) Act, 2002, provided temporary clearance to the manufacturing industry to establish industry and commence commercial operation, giving a three-year window to obtain all clearances. Besides investments in and around Bengaluru, many industrial areas in the north Karnataka region have been attracting investments. A recent State High Level Clearance Committee (SHLCC) meeting has cleared Rs. 3,540 crore investment of Aequs SEZ Private Limited to develop a consumer electronic and durable goods cluster in Dharwad. This would be the first sector-specific investment in line with the Narendra Modi-led government’s Atmanirbhar initiative, Mr. Shettar said. The SHLCC on September 30 cleared investments of six proposals worth over Rs. 15,000 crore. More than two-dozen pharmaceutical industries have proposed to invest in the Kadechur industrial area in Yadgir district and most of the firms were from Hyderabad, Mr. Shettar said. All these investments will revive the cash-strapped economy of the State which had already been hit by the pandemic, floods, and shortfall in revenues owing to reduction in GST compensation by the Centre, experts said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/karnataka-ranks-third-in-attracting-investments-in-q2/article32825041.ece
11 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Over 7.6 lakh tests done over a week in State||Karnataka, which has been testing over one lakh samples daily for the past four days, conducted a record 1,12,770 tests in a 24-hour period that ended on Saturday. This included 64,367RT-PCR tests. With this, the total number of tests touched 58,52,300. In the past one week alone, Karnataka has done 7,62,570 tests, which is almost equal to the total number of tests done till July. The State’s COVID-19 tests breached the 50 lakh mark on October 2. From an average of 80 tests a day in March, the daily tests have crossed an average of 90,000 since October 5. In fact, the State ramped up its testing from May onwards. From 1,587 tests in March, Karnataka conducted 3,21,115 tests till June. This further rose to 7,65,945 in July and more than doubled in August with 15,93,892. The number went up to 20,18,194 in September. The tests per million went up from 44,099 on September 1, and to 72,541 on September 30. Karnataka started conducting Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) with one sample in June. This number rose to 1,68,472 samples in July, 7,24,469 in August, and 9,13,158 in September.  However, despite the high number of samples tested, experts say the State’s testing is yet to match the velocity of the virus. The Test Positivity Rate (TPR) on September 30 marginally increased to 12.3% from 11.8% on September 1. As on Saturday, the TPR stood at 9.32%. According to epidemiologists, a high TPR indicates that testing is relatively limited to people with high suspicion of COVID-19 and may miss new chains of transmission. “It would have made a big difference if the State had achieved the current rate of testing one or two months ago,” said a senior doctor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/over-76-lakh-tests-done-over-a-week-in-state/article32825024.ece
11 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Police unearth stamp paper racket in Bengaluru||The S.J. Park police have unearthed a fake stamp paper racket which was allegedly being run for several years at the City Civil Court complex on K.G. Road, close to the police headquarters. Four people have been arrested in connection with the racket — the main accused, Hussain Modi Babu, 53, and three typists and stamp paper vendors who worked at the court complex, Harish, 55, Shahwar, 42, and Najma, 35. The police on Saturday announced that they arrested Babu a few days ago while he was handing over a bundle of fake stamp papers to Harish. Based on their confession, a police team raided the city court complex and arrested Shahwar and Najma. “The typists would buy fake stamp papers that Babu made at half the price and sell it to people at the court complex,” said a senior police officer. Another team raided Babu’s house in Vivek Nagar, where they seized a computer, colour printers, and fake seals of the Shivajinagar and Bommanahalli sub-registrar offices. “We recovered a large stack of fake stamp papers of face value running into several lakhs of rupees,” the officer added. Babu allegedly confessed that he used plain A4-sized paper to print stamp paper and faked the franking and embossing process using a different software. The accused used to print stamp paper of different denominations depending on the demand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-unearth-stamp-paper-racket-in-bengaluru/article32825028.ece
11 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Excess rain creates onion scarcity||Excess rain in parts of the State in August and September led to large-scale crop damage that has now caused a severe scarcity of onions, driving its price northwards. “The supply of onions has dropped to unprecedented levels. Crop loss was reported from almost all onion growing regions of the State starting from Sira, Molakalmur and Hubballi to Belagavi. What has worsened the situation is a similar crop loss in Maharashtra and Telangana as well,” said Ravi Kumar of Bangalore Onion and Potato Traders’ Association. Onions are currently being traded at Rs. 40 a kg in the wholesale market, which has already pushed the retail price to above Rs. 50 level, sometimes even being sold at Rs. 60 a kg. However, despite paying a steep price, the quality of onions is poor. “Waterlogging and increased soil moisture have damaged the crop hugely,” Mr. Ravi Kumar said. All hopes are pinned on the next harvest from Rajasthan, which is expected to reach the market in November–December. If that fails, it will create a long period of acute scarcity till the next harvest in February, warn traders. “If the Rajasthan crop is not adequate, we may see onion prices cross the Rs. 120 level, but then too, the quality may be very bad,” Mr. Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/excess-rain-creates-onion-scarcity/article32825490.ece
11 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Rise in demonetised currency scams has the police befuddled||In the first week of October, the R.T. Nagar police arrested two people hailing from Odisha and recovered demonetised currency notes of Rs. 1 crore face value from them. The duo were trying to sell the currency notes for a few lakhs, promising prospective buyers that they would help them convert the notes into valid currency at a bank in Nepal. This is at least the fifth such case that has come to light this year, and the third since the lockdown was announced, said the police, who are befuddled by the rackets. Some of those arrested also seem to falsely believe the exchange of old notes into legal currency is still happening in Nepal, said police officers. “We have checked with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Nowhere are these notes accepted for exchange any more” saidBengaluru Police Commissioner Kamal Pant. A probe is on to ascertain whether these notes are indeed being exchanged for legal tender in Nepal’s black market, where Indian currency is widely used, and the country is said to be stuck with a large cache of Indian demonetised currency. “But since India has stopped exchanging demonetised currency even from Nepal, it doesn’t make sense for them to buy more such notes” said a senior officer. Carriers, not sources Two accused, Sheikh Toufil and Mudasir, who were arrested by the R.T. Nagar police recently claimed to have bought demonetised currency of Rs. 1 crore face value for Rs. 2.5 lakh from one Rehman, and were in turn trying to sell it for a higher return. “In most cases, those arrested are not the source of the currency, but carriers,” an officer said. A senior police officer said the demonetised currency racket has become another baseless scam such as ‘rice pulling’ and ‘two-headed snakes’ that gullible people fall for. “It is ironic that many refuse to accept the Rs. 10 coin, a legal tender issued by the RBI, despite several circulars, but fall for the ruse of exchange of demonetised currency.” Another officer said caches of demonetised currency, which were in black and could not be exchanged during the stipulated period in 2016, seem to have found their way into the market for this kind of duping. Lockdown and the economic stress may have pushed more people into such desperate schemes, the officer said. Mr. Pant appealed to citizens not to fall for such scams. “Demonetised currency is not being exchanged into legal tender any more, anywhere in the world. So I request people to alert us of gangs trying to lure them with tall claims,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rise-in-demonetised-currency-scams-has-the-police-befuddled/article32825210.ece

11 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Stay on criminal proceedings against CSITA||The High Court of Karnataka has stayed till November 4 the criminal proceedings against the Church of South India Trust Association (CSITA) initiated by the city police and the provisional attachment of bank deposits by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on the allegation that the CSITA is unlawfully occupying the land of All Saints’ Church, Hosur Road, and received compensation from the BMRCL though the land actually belonging to the Defence authorities. Justice Suraj Govindaraj passed the interim order on a petition filed by the CSITA questioning the legality of the criminal case registered by the city police on August 17, 2019 and the attachment of deposits of Rs. 59.52 crore by the ED on September 8, 2020. The criminal proceedings were initiated based on the complaint filed by Indian Army’s Quartermaster, CMP Centre and School, Bengaluru, alleging that the CSITA unlawfully received compensation for land, measuring about 7426.886 sq.m acquired under Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act for the benefit of Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL). Granted in 1884 It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that land with certain other land were granted to Lord Bishop and Archdeacon of Madras in 1884 by the president at the Court of His Highness, the Maharaja of Mysore, under the authority vested in him by the government of India, and no rents were required to be paid to the government. The Indian Churches Trustees (ICT) took over the land of All Saints’ Church in 1929 following enactment of Indian Churches Act, 1927. Though the Bangalore Civil Station and Bangalore Military Area were restored to Maharaja of Mysore after Indian independence in 1947, the land granted by the crown prior to retrocession were recognised as valid grant, the petitioner claimed while contending the ICT, which owned title over the land, in 1980 appointed the CSITA as new trustees. It was also pointed out in the petition that the Defence authorities never raised any objection or claimed the land even when a portion of the land was given for Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board in 1972 for construction of a water reservoir. The petitioner also contended that the Defence authorities had not objected even when the notification for acquiring portion of the All Saints’ Church land for metro project was issued in March 2017 and disbursal of part payment of compensation to petitioner was made in April 2019. The Defence authorities raised objection for the first time in July 2019 and complaint with the police was lodged without waiting for the petitioner’s response.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/stay-on-criminal-proceedings-against-csita/article32825487.ece

11 October 2020||Bengaluru/Kalaburagi,KARNATAKA||Hoarding causes prices of pulses to almost double||When Meenakshi from Banashankari went grocery shopping a few days ago, she was shocked to see that the price of toor dal had almost doubled in a little over a fortnight. Other pulses too had become more expensive. While excess rain has had a role to play, industry insiders attribute the trend largely to the hoarding of pulses by “big players”. It has created an artificial scarcity in the market, which in turn, has resulted in a rally in prices over the last two weeks. For instance, toor dal that was trading in the range of Rs. 70–Rs. 90 a kg two weeks ago, but was being quoted from Rs. 100–Rs. 140 in the wholesale market on Saturday. The prices of other pulses have also shot up. This price rise comes in the immediate aftermath of the recent farm reforms Bills, which among other measures deregulated trade in pulses. The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, recently passed by Parliament and made into law, removed pulses, cereals, and oil seeds from the list of essential commodities. “Big players have definitely resorted to hoarding over the last few weeks. However, unlike before, now that pulses are no longer an essential commodity, the government cannot check for stocks or intervene. The prices of pulses, cereals, and oil seeds will henceforth be prone to such artificial rallies,” said Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, chairman, APMC Committee, Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry. At a recent meeting of stakeholders, including mill owners, farmers and government officers, in Kalaburagi, which is the biggest contributor of red gram in Karnataka, it emerged that an artificial scarcity in the market was the primary reason for the rally in prices. Rithendra Sugoor, Joint Director of Agriculture, added that a premature assumption that this season’s harvest will be low had “prompted traders to keep the crop with them for better price”. T.N. Prakash Kammardi, former chairman of the Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission, said that this artificial rise in prices had proved their argument against the recent farm reform Bills. “The government should not give up control over agriculture commodity marketing. The present system, as is being shown, neither helps farmers nor consumers, but only big corporates,” he alleged. Farmers had sold red gram, from which toor dal is processed, at a low price of Rs. 6,100 a quintal earlier this year. What has aggravated the situation is crop loss owing to excess rain in parts of the State in August–September. “Of the 5.5 lakh hectares that had redgram sown in Kalaburagi, crop on over 1 lakh hectares has been completely damaged,” said Mr. Sugoor. However, he hoped the yield in the rest of the area would be good.  Big players have definitely resorted to hoarding over the last few weeks. However, unlike before, now that pluses are no longer an essential commodity, the government cannot check for stocks or intervene,” Ramesh Chandra Lahoti,chairman, APMC Committee, FKCCI||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hoarding-of-pulses-causes-prices-to-almost-double-in-two-weeks-in-state/article32825000.ece

Yediyurappa too had already clarified that a decision would be taken by the Minister for Primary and Secondary Education in consultation with educationalists, teachers, and parents.   Meanwhile, a statement by former Rajya Sabha member Prabhakar Kore that he had not yet retired from politics has given room for speculation about him being an aspirant for BJP ticket for the Belagavi lok Sabha byelection. Mr. Kore, who attended the meeting called by Mr. Kateel, spoke to presspersons and said that the party high command would decide on the candidate. When asked whether he would contest if the party chose him, he said that he had not yet retired from politics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/belagavi-ls-byelection-decision-on-candidate-after-poll-date-is-known/article32825013.ece

11 October 2020||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Council election: ‘JD(S) will seek votes on work done’||Former Minister and JD(S) leader Basavaraj Horatti has said that it was during the tenure of former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy that more steps were taken to help graduates and address issues concerning teachers and youths, and on this basis they would seek votes in the council election. Addressing presspersons along with JD(S) national general secretary N.H. Konaraddi, other office bearers Gururaj Hunasimarad and Rajanna Koravi, Mr. Horatti said unlike the other candidates in the council election, the JD(S) would be seeking votes on its work and was ready to answer all the queries of the voters. “We have documents on what we did for teachers and graduates, on the recruitment that we conducted, grants extended to educational institutions, and various agitations for the sake of graduates and teachers. What happened to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise of two crore jobs? What has the BJP done for teachers and graduates? Let them come for an open debate, we will participate with all the documents,” he said. Mr. Horatti admitted that there was a lack of interest among the graduate voters to enrol themselves in the voters’ list because of which there were just over 92,000 voters in the constituency although graduates in the region exceeded four lakh. On the election plan, he said the party had set up district committees and zone committees to take up canvassing. “Considering the COVID-19 pandemic, the election strategy will be changed and one-to-one contact will be made to appeal for votes. Other modes of communication to reach out to the electorate will also be done,” he said. Mr. Konaraddi said JD(S) had given ticket to party workers and would seek votes based on its work. Although the BJP, the Congress and other parties had made promises, it was only JD(S) which had addressed the problems of teachers and graduates, he said. JD(S) candidate for Karnataka West Graduates’ Constituency Shivashankar Kallaur said voters were disappointed with present MLC S.V. Sankanur who was seeking re-election. “In the last six years, he has done nothing for the graduates except giving memoranda,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/council-election-jds-will-seek-votes-on-work-done/article32825012.ece
11 October 2020||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Merge all four State road transport corporations and save public money: Anantha Subba Rao||President of KSRTC Staff and Workers Federation H.V. Anantha Subba Rrao has said that instead of unnecessarily spending crores on establishment costs through four State road transport corporations, the government should merge them and save public money. Addressing presspersons here on Saturday, Mr. Rao said over two decades ago the State government carved out four transport corporations out of the existing one corporation, and during this period the decision had only resulted in increasing more establishment cost and cumulative loss. “From around Rs. 300 crore from a single transport corporation, the cumulative loss had now mounted to Rs. 2,317 crore from the four transport corporations. With the creation of new transport corporations, additional posts were created including those of managing directors, chairpersons and others, and money was spent on regional offices. When everything could be done through a single corporation, best solution was to merge the corporations,” he said. Mr. Rao alleged that the State government was forcing the employees of the State road transport corporations to take the path of agitation by being apathetic towards their demands. He said that despite its own directions on full payment to workers during the pandemic period, the employees of the State transport corporations were not being paid properly and allowances, incentives and other facilities were being cut. “Our other main demand is that as the transport corporations are not meant for making profit and are for serving the people, the government should pay the salary grants to these corporations. Initially, the government paid full salaries to employees and now only 70% was being paid till September,” he said. He alleged that as the government had only paid 70% and asked the transport corporations to mobilise funds for the remaining 30%, the officials were finding new methods to deprive employees of their rightful wages and some were being forced to go on leave. Because of non-availability of funds, the transport corporations were unable to pay even the Provident Fund contributions and gratuity dues, he said. “We have submitted our list of demands repeatedly and sought appointment to meet the Minister. However, the government is not ready to even listen to us,” he said. General strike General Secretary of the federation D.A. Vijaya Bhaskar said the present government was trying to snub the trade unions and the voice of the farmers being raised for their rightful demands. The Joint Committee of Trade Unions had given a call for national strike on November 26 to condemn the anti-labour and anti-farmer policies of the Centre and preparations were on, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/merge-all-four-state-road-transport-corporations-and-save-public-money-anantha-subba-rao/article32825016.ece

Connections have been given in Derebail South (Ward 24), Derebail South West (Ward 26), Kodialbail (Ward 30), Bejai (Ward 31), Kadri North (Ward 32) and Kadri South (Ward 33). He told The Hindu that in the first phase, Mangaluru City Corporation has permitted the company to lay pipeline network to a length of 60 km to supply natural gas in six wards.

Mr. Zunke said that the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has allowed laying 10-km-long main steel pipeline on the highway between Arkula and Padil and between Panambur and KIOCL in the first phase. The total length of the steel pipeline to be laid along National Highways Nos 66 and 75 would be over 40 km. The city will source natural gas from the main Kochi-Mangaluru pipeline which is on the verge of completion. Gas will be supplied to houses through a network of pipelines to be laid along the two highways, main city roads and interior roads in wards. He said that GAIL has authorised two direct marketing agencies — Amoeba Events Pvt. Ltd. and Yogmaya & Co — in Mangaluru to collect registrations on its behalf.

11 October 2020||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||BJP denies irregularities in projects taken up under Smart City Mission||The BJP on Saturday refuted allegations made by Ivan D’Souza, former MLC, that there was large-scale irregularities in the projects taken up in the city under the Smart City Mission. Addressing presspersons, general secretary of the BJP Dakshina Kannada unit Sudhir Shetty Kannur denied that there was threefold increase in the estimated cost of the projects. He said the costs had been estimated as per the scheduled rate fixed by the Public Works Department. He said the Managing Director of Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. enjoyed powers to sanction projects costing up to Rs. 5 crore. The high-power committee of the government approved projects costing above Rs. 5 crore and upto Rs. 50 crore. Projects costing Rs. 200 crore and above will have to be approved by the Cabinet. All estimates under the mission will have to be approved by the Board of the company. Mr. Shetty said that 60% estimates of the projects taken up under the mission had been made in the last two-and-half years under the Congress regime when it was leading the city corporation council. The Congress had only decided on the projects to be taken up under area based development in eight wards. As Mr. D’Souza, at a press conference on Thursday, had sought an enquiry by the Anti Corruption Bureau or Lokayukta into the alleged irregularities, the BJP welcomes it as the projects got underway during the Congress regime. He said the projects were under progress in eight wards. Premananda Shetty, Whip in the council led by the BJP, said the projects had got a fillip since a year. The detailed project report for river front development is being prepared now. The BJP has not sidelined this project, he said. Housing project Referring to the housing project proposed near Shakthi Nagar for the poor, Mr. Shetty said the corporation has taken steps to deposit Rs. 60 lakh with the Forest Department to remove trees in the project site and compensatory afforestation in 20 acres of land reserved for compensatory afforestation in Tenka Edapadavu village. The “goof up” done by the Congress by not following the due procedures of a housing project has now forced the present administration to re-invite bids to take up construction of houses under the same project, Mr. Shetty alleged. Mayor Diwakar was present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-denies-irregularities-in-projects-taken-up-under-smart-city-mission/article32825624.ece

Yadapadithaya here on Saturday. Speaking at a function organised by the Dakshina Kannada Sahitya Parishat to present the Karantha award on the 118th birth anniversary of Shivaram Karanth, Mr. Yadapadithaya said the erudite Karanth commanded respect for his knowledge. “I still remember his advice to me when I just started teaching in the university as a temporary lecturer. Rather than just stating what is in the curriculum, he asked me to go beyond and share my experience with students. I have continued to follow his words,” he said. Ganesh Karnik, former MLC, said it was unfortunate that stalwarts like Karanth, former Supreme Court judge K.S. Hegde, and B.R. Ambedkar were not elected to the Lok Sabha. Octogenarian writer and folk researcher Padaru Mahabhaleshwar Bhat, who waspresented with the Karantha award, recalled his brief interactions with Karanth and his wife Leela Karanth.

The saplings were planted by family members of patients who passed away, at the children’s park. Saplings of herbal plants were distributed to cancer patients at Shirdi Sai Baba OPD block. In a press note, Sharath K. Rao, Dean of KMC, said though 32.5 million people require palliative care, only 10% were getting it. The hospital started palliative care specifically for cancer patients and it has now been extended to other patients, who are suffering from chronic diseases. Dr. Rao said palliative care ensures access to the best standard of care and highest level of comfort for the patient. It also ensures best support to the family members. Palliative care was relevant in this pandemic as World Health Organisation has said that any approach that does not include palliative care was “medically deficient and ethically indefensible”, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/saplings-planted-to-mark-hospice-day/article32825629.ece

The new circular was issued by the Director of the department late on Friday. The earlier circular issued on October 8 caused anxiety among students and institutions as it said the supplementary examinations should be held for all those who had failed in the I PU examination held in February. This created confusion as the failed candidates, as per the earlier order, had been promoted and were now half way through the second year course. The new circular clearly states that supplementary examination will be conducted for those who remained absent in the examination held in February. This will also be for students from earlier academic years who remained absent or failed the examination held in February. These two categories of the students, as per the circular issued in July 13, had been admitted to the II PU course and institutions were asked to hold an examination for them before the first term examination of the course. The new circular stated that the supplementary examination should be held at the respective colleges and it had to be completed by October 20. It further noted that if students did not get the necessary marks in the examination, then minimum marks should be given to pass them.

11 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Positives and negatives of Vidyagama||Even as the Vidyagama initiative has been temporarily halted in the State over the COVID-19 scare, as many as five teachers have succumbed to the disease in Mysuru with 124 testing positive to the infection since August. One teacher's death has been reported from Chamarajanagar. Sources in the Department of Public Instruction claimed that the COVID-19 deaths among the teaching community in Mysuru took place before and also after the launch of Vidyagama while arguing that the programme should not be solely blamed for the spread of the infection among teachers. However, the teaching community working in the government schools is perturbed after the reports of their colleagues contracting the infection during an exclusive testing ocnducted for teachers here in anticipation of the reopening of schools. The spread of infection led to a debate here on whether the programme should be suspended for now as a precaution until the cases recede in the interest of students and the teaching community. The COVID-19 cases have crossed 40,000-mark in Mysuru with 7,467 active cases as on Friday. In total, 862 persons have died due to the infection, which is second highest after Bengaluru. The cumulative positive cases as on Friday were 41,058. Mysuru district alone has over 9,000 teachers, including from the high schools and primary schools. As of now, nearly 6,000 teachers had undergone the COVID-19 test (Rapid Antigen Test) conducted for free by the Health Department on the department’s request and the remaining were expected to be tested in the next few days. Mysuru was among the foremost districts to subject the government school teachers to mandatory testing in anticipation of reopening of schools with the Centre lifting the restrictions. However, the State government, after growing concerns expressed by the parents and the public in general, has made it clear that the schools were not reopening now with cases on the surge. When contacted, Uday Kumar, Education Officer, DDPI Office, Mysuru confirmed the cases and said most infected teachers are under home isolation. Five deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred since August. Many teachers have already recovered. Barring one taluk, 124 teachers had tested positive in eight taluks in the district. In Chamarajanagar district, 35 teachers had tested positive and31 had recovered. Those in hospitals had been discharged and only three are in hospital till date. A teacher died of COVID-19 in the district. Chamarajanagar taluk reported 23 cases, which was the highest in the district, and the least was reported from Hanur where one teacher was infected, according to DDPI Jaware Gowda. While no deaths had occurred in Kodagu, 44 cases had been reported in the coffee district. A total of 32 teachers have already recovered. DDPI P.S. Machado said four schoolchildren from the aided schools had contracted the infection. Kodagu has 1,439 teachers from 467 schools. Apprehensions If the decision to suspend Vidyagama for the time being has brought relief to teachers, with some of them even on COVID-19 duty as well, apprehensions were expressed since the beginning of the programme over teachers as well as children being exposed to the risks of contracting the infection. The teachers had been told to engage in teaching visiting the community as many children, especially those in rural areas, were not able to afford online education, and such children should not be deprived of education. The outcome was positive as it kept the children engaged besides bringing more admissions to the government schools which had been shut down since last two years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/positives-and-negatives-of-vidyagama/article32825204.ece

11 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Farm Bills: It is an assault on farmers, says Surjewala||The Congress party organized a farmers’ meet in Mandya on Saturday, highlighting their fight against the farm bills of the BJP government at the Centre and in the State. While All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary in-charge of Karnataka Randeep Singh Surjewala, who addressed the gathering of farmers, accused the BJP government of launching ‘an assault on the farmers’, who he called the ‘soul of India’, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said the Congress will return to power in the State and the Centre and withdraw the anti-farmer laws that threatened to push the farmers into an abyss. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) chief D.K. Shivakumar said the meet had been organised to send the voice of the farmers from Mandya to the national capital. He called upon the farmers to participate in the country-wide signature campaign through which Congress leader Sonia Gandhi plans to highlight the farmers’ woes to President Ram Nath Kovind. Mr. Surjewala warned that the Narendra Modi-led government’s new farm bills would lead to an eventual dismantling of the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) structure in the country, deny the farmers the minimum support price and bring them under the control of a handful capitalists. During the last three years, the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane had been increased by only Rs. 10 from the earlier Rs. 275 to Rs. 285. When the Manmohan Singh-led Congress government was in power in the Centre, the FRP had been increased from Rs. 117 to Rs. 220, he said. He lashed out at the B.S. Yediyurappa government in Karnataka for amending to the Karnataka State Land Reforms Act, paving the way for agricultural land to be purchased by land sharks. Mr. Siddaramaiah said he raised the anti-farmer laws brought in by the State government in the Legislative Assembly, but his opposition fell on the deaf ears of the BJP government. He called upon the farmers to mobilise themselves against the Bills and force the government to withdraw them. Mr. Shivakumar said the ‘anti-farmer and anti-labour’ Bills of the State government had been defeated in the Legislative Council and thanked the members of the Legislative Council for the concern they had shown the farmers and the working class.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farm-bills-it-is-an-assault-on-farmers-says-surjewala/article32825051.ece
11 October 2020||MYSURU/Hassan,KARNATAKA||Excess rains, pandemic did not impact sowing in State||Excessive rains across most parts of the State during this year’s South West monsoon are now set to retreat. Meanwhile, the pandemic has not affected agricultural activity if the sowing status is any indication, as per the reports of the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) The sowing target for kharif was 73 lakh hectares against which the actual coverage as of September 30, 2020, was 77.5 lakh hectares. This is more than the actual area covered during the corresponding period last year when 68.84 hectares was brought under sowing, KSNDMC’s statistics reveal. The coverage of foodgrains was spread over 53.75 lakh hectares, oil seeds accounted for 10.05 lakh hectares and cash crop was spread over 13.69 lakh hectares. Rice coverage was spread over 10.36 lakh hectares while 6.72 lakh hectares was brought under ragi. Maize accounted for 14.14 lakh hectares and jowar covered an area of 0.73 lakh hectares in the State. Besides, 19.58 lakh hectares was brought under pulses. South Interior Karnataka comprising 11 districts brought in 20.44 lakh hectares of land under sowing against the target of 22.74 lakh hectares and the area met 90% of the target. North Interior Karnataka comprising 12 districts brought 50.69 lakh hectares under sowing against a target of 46.81 lakh hectares and achieved 108% of the actual target, as per KSNDMC statistics. Meanwhile, continuing rains in parts of South Interior Karnataka attributed to the low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal, are expected to persist for a few days but will not have any negative impact on standing crops. Local authorities said paddy was the only major standing crop in the region and the current spell of rains will not affect as it was still in the growth stage. Paddy cultivation The Joint Director of Agriculture in Mysuru, Mahanteshappa, said over 1 lakh hectares of land have been brought under paddy cultivation in Mysuru district and the current spell of rains will not affect the crops at this stage. But blast disease or Benki Roga can afflict the crops though it can be managed by the farmers. But in parts of Malenadu, heavy rains concentrated for a few days and lashed the region in August. This may affect paddy, maize and tobacco production, although the negative impact will be marginal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/excess-rains-pandemic-did-not-impact-sowing-in-state/article32825045.ece

For, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Saturday was apprised of the imperatives of the task. The ORR bisects the Mysuru-Bengaluru railway line, Mysuru-Hassan line, Mysuru-RBI printing press line and Mysuru-Nanjangud railway line. Though the 42.5-km-long ORR is a six-lane road and is currently managed by the NHAI, the road barrels into a two-lane stretch as it approaches these underpasses. This not only slows down the traffic but poses a risk to the motorists, especially at night. I.K. Pandey, DG (Projects), Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, who was in the city inspected the ORR on Saturday. Mysuru MP Pratap Simha and MUDA Chairman H.V. Rajiv were present. The two told Mr. Pandey of the need for widening the underpass at the earliest. The project is pending since more than 6 years but there are issues pertaining to its execution and funding. Though all rail underpasses are handled by the railway authorities, lack of clarity on the funding mechanism has delayed its implementation. But ever since the MUDA handed the ORR to NHAI for maintenance, the latter is expected to fund the project and fast track its execution. Mr. Rajiv said a proposal for a grade separator at the KRS Road and ORR junction was also discussed and Mr. Pandey has assured them of taking up the works on a priority basis. The works assumes significance in view of the increase in traffic along the ORR and the imperatives of removing the bottlenecks created by the narrow stretch at the underpass. Mr. Rajiv also sought NHAI support for the peripheral ring road (PRR) proposed by the MUDA. He said the ORR is already attaining saturation level of traffic and it was imperative to think of the future and ensure traffic diversion by creating a PRR. The proposed PRR is expected to come at a distance of 6 to 7 km from the existing ORR and will have a length of 106 km. Mr. Rajiv said the PRR may require approximately 600 acres and the NHAI MD has sought a detailed project report before it could be approved for funding. The PRR was conceptualised in the Mysuru Master Plan-2031 and was first announced by the MUDA in 2016. The alignment of the PRR has already been drawn in the master plan but may require tweaking and the existing roads connecting the hinterland may have to be broadened.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nhai-to-fund-widening-of-underpasses-on-orr/article32825203.ece

The incident took place on Thursday night when Kamala, who experienced labour pain, was walking from her house at Aneholla village towards the nearest hospital taking the forest route in the M.M.Hills Wildlife Sanctuary. The nearest hospital was at a distance of 5 km from the village and Kamala was accompanied by her husband Veeranna. But en route, Kamala developed severe pain and could no longer walk and went into labour. Veeranna left both the mother and the child in the middle of the forest and went to fetch help from the nearest village. The local people arranged for a goods vehicle which reached the spot and helped shift Kamala and her child to the hospital. Doctors said both were in good health. The issue was brought to the notice of the Forest Department staff who said there are a few hamlets where ambulance cannot go due to difficult terrain. The normal practice of the local community was to shift pregnant women to a hospital a few days before the delivery date to avoid such complications.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/woman-gives-birth-in-forest-at-night/article32825009.ece

Prem Krishnan has issued an order to acquire the land owned by Vellukunnel Jimmy Zakaria at Anayirangal, near Munnar. Around 3.68 hectares, including the Calypso Adventure Resort and a camp, in Chinnakanal village was found to be encroached upon by creating fake documents in the wrong ‘thandaper.’ Earlier, a team under the Subcollector had been asked to identify land encroachers in Munnar and prepare their list. Mr. Zakaria was found to be a major encroacher. Title deeds cancelled The Subcollector’s report has ordered cancellation of title deeds of three plots of land encroached by Mr. Zakaria. The report said that some officials had connived with him to make fake documents and title deeds in the wrong ‘thandaper.’ The revenue team found that the original title deed of the 3.68 hectares was issued to another land situated nearly half a kilometre away, proving that the title deed was forged. Order to remove camp The Udumbanchola tahsildar (LA) has been asked to remove the camp and acquire the land immediately. The report further stated that the Revenue Department had called many hearings, seeking land documents for verification. However, the landowner failed to submit the original records. The tahsildar found that the ‘thandaper’ number (3542) of three plots out of the four owned by Mr. Zakaria was forged. Surveyor’s action The report also recommended action against former taluk surveyor M.S. Anoop. When the tahsildar had sought a sketch of the controversial land, the surveyor attached a survey report excluding the resort and camp from the sketch. The action was aimed at helping the land owner cover up the encroachment, said the report. The plots encroached upon by Mr. Zakaria are in areas that have high commercial value.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/368-ha-encroached-land-to-be-acquired/article32825145.ece

11 October 2020||KALPETTA,KERALA||Now, UAVs make a statement in farm sector too||The dearth of skilled workers following the lockdown restrictions, especially deploying manpower, has affected farming operations and put the farm community in a fix. However, the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) at Ambalavayal under Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) has found a solution in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The KVK conducted a UAV-based demonstration of fertilizer application for farmers at the Kolavally Padashekharam in Mullankolly grama panchayat in Wayanad on Saturday. The application of Sampoorna, a micronutrient for rice cultivation, using an UAV was first of its kind in Wayanad and it evoked curiosity among villagers. During these challenging times, mechanisation and measures to reduce the number of labourers at the same time and enhancing precise farming techniques to maximise production are called for, says Allan Thomas, head, KVK. The extended time of operations and labour cost are the major issues affecting the agricultural sector. Both these issues are solved by the UAV, mostly called drone technology, that gives a new face to agricultural mechanisation, says Dr. Thomas. UAVs have multiple applications in agriculture such as measuring nutrient levels, yield map, weed control. UAVs are significant where they replace labour-intensive and potentially harmful use of backpack sprayers and similar equipment, he says. Risks reduced It reduces the risks of human spraying also. The manual spray takes around half-a-day per acre at a cost of Rs. 500 to Rs. 600 while a UAV takes around 5-10 minutes to spray an acre at a cost of Rs. 800 .The cost can be reduced by employing the equipment in a large area. Another advantage is that it is GPS-enabled and ensures precise application of the mixture, says Dr.Thomas. The height of flight, speed of drone, and fertilizer quantity were set by a group of scientists of the KAU consisting Aparna Radhakrishnan, K.P. Shivaji, V.P. Indulekha, and Sanju Balan. Jiju P. Alex, Director of Extension, KAU, inaugurated the programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/now-uavs-make-a-statement-in-farm-sector-too/article32825179.ece

Simon, 56, from Neeleswaram, was never cheated till a man successfully sold him four dummies as prize-winning lotteries last month. After a hiatus of a year when he took a break for cancer treatment, Simon was back selling lottery tickets when a man on a two-wheeler stopped him on the tracks like a long-lost acquaintance on September 22. “He wanted to know why I was not around and then asked me whether I could encash four tickets for which he had won Rs. 1,000 each. Since he acted like an acquaintance, I did not suspect any foul play and paid Rs. 3,600 in cash and issued tickets worth Rs. 400,” he said. But he was in for a shock when the District Lottery Office returned the tickets, saying that the ticket numbers were tampered with. “Who would have thought that people would even cheat a cancer patient,” bemoaned Simon. Since then, he had paid the money back to the dealer in small lots. Cheating of unsuspecting lottery vendors, especially the aged and the sick, using the facade of tickets having won small prize money seems to be quite rampant in the district.  Twin ploys Twin ploys have emerged as the popular routes for such cheating — tampering to match the number of winning tickets as published in the media and outright forgery of making colour photocopies of such tickets. “These fraudsters never directly approach agencies, knowing fully well that they are likely to be caught. So, they cunningly choose poor vendors who can be easily fooled,” said A.V. Prakashan who runs a lottery agency at Kalady from whom Simon bought the tickets. Tampering with tickets is so skilfully done that it is hard to detect with the naked eye, while forged tickets rival even the original ones in appearance, and in some cases, even pass the vetting using scanners. Meanwhile, Lottery Traders Union said it was seized of the matter and had raised it with the Lottery Department. “Bar codes have been issued as an additional security feature, while vendors have been given lens to closely verify the tickets. We have held awareness classes and asked vendors to avoid such payments as far as possible and instead direct such people to agents,” said Shaji Edappally, district president of the union. Senior Lottery Department sources said such complaints come up at the monthly monitoring cell meetings convened in the presence of the District Collector, and the District Lottery Officers concerned lodge police complaints. However, poor vendors end up losing what little of their hard-earned money.  Bar codes have been issued as an additional security feature.

11 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Excise forms special squad to stop ganja influx||The sudden influx of ganja in huge quantities from across the border has prompted the Excise Department to form a six-member special squad in the district. The squad under the direct supervision of the Deputy Excise Commissioner is being led by an Excise Inspector and is entrusted with intelligence gathering and field operations. “Huge hauls of ganja were reported from across the State recently, exposing the inter-State network for smuggling from across the border, especially Andhra Pradesh. None of those big consignments reached Ernakulam, as they were seized shortly after crossing the check-posts thanks to an alert Excise force in the districts concerned. However, the fact that the potential for a lucrative trade to thrive in the district remains real in the event of some of these consignments reaching here is the reason why we formed the squad preemptively,” said T.A. Ashok Kumar, Deputy Excise Commissioner, Ernakulam. Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh has emerged as the single biggest source of ganja flowing into the State, especially in the months post-lockdown. Mr. Kumar even suspects that the snuggling networks have been able to sell the drug to a large number of youngsters and jobless people in the wake of the economic distress spawned by the pandemic. Problem of plenty An Excise official with a wide ground-level intelligence network said a situation had evolved where the supply of ganja had overshot the demand, leading to piling up of the drug in Rajahmundry. “Our sources say it has reached a point where youngsters with not much money to buy large stocks and going there for small quantities like 1 to 2 kg end up being bundled with many folds more, as suppliers desperate to clear the stock are willing to take huge cuts in price,” he said. This, he claimed, was the case in which 100 kg of ganja was seized by the Excise squad in Thiruvananthapuram a few days ago. Mr. Kumar said the huge price cut had left carriers with the potential to make a big profit, if they managed to somehow dodge enforcement and reach the consignments to the distribution networks who even otherwise made a fortune by splitting even a 1 kg consignment into numerous satchels of small quantities. The district has a well-oiled distribution network comprising youngsters aged below 22, said the official. Easier to buy Ganja seems to have recaptured its pole position among popular drugs owing to a slew of reasons from easy availability to diminished purchasing capacity of potential buyers. “Large-scale smuggling in of synthetic drugs to the district is no longer feasible, since parties and large gatherings where they were in demand are no longer taking place owing to physical distancing norms,” said Mr. Kumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/excise-dept-forms-special-squad-to-stop-ganja-influx/article32825601.ece

Among the youngest in a group of 16, she was made the president, and since then she has been busy holding monthly meetings and taking care of three different micro-enterprises of her NHG till the pandemic put brakes on them. “Corona has hit the market for our products a bit, but that is manageable, since we have local demand. What we miss the most are interactions during our meetings held twice a month. The meetings were always a lot of fun with singing and dancing and often overshot the supposedly two-hour duration,” said Ms. Pushpavally. The meetings have remained suspended since February, and M.V. Yakub, a 66-year-old retired postman, looks back at them with so much longing. “At a time when neighbourly relations were not once they used to be, the meetings were occasions for people of our age to sit and reminisce about our past and share joyful moments by celebrating birthdays and wedding anniversaries,” he said. Going online It was on realising the significance of the meetings for the elderly that the Kudumbashree started weekly Google meets a fortnight ago, and they were received with great enthusiasm. “We are accommodating as many members as possible in the meetings, though those without smartphones cannot join. We are also urging participants to educate fellow members on how to join the meets considering that they may be able to better communicate among themselves,” said Ponni Kannan, Kudumbashree district programme manager. Google meets are among a slew of services organised by the Kudumbashree for the elderly in the wake of the pandemic. Grand Care project Under the Grand Care project, being implemented in association with the Department of Women and Child Development, the Kudumbashree has been reaching out to the elderly to enquire after their well-being and offer psychological support. A mobile application-driven project was facilitated by local body-specific data on the elderly. “We have deployed at least one resource person for a panchayat who, among other things, create awareness about the need for proper quarantine and reverse quarantine and ensure delivery of essentials, especially medicines. “In individual cases beyond the capabilities of resource persons, our community counsellors take over,” said Arathy Aravind, district programme manager, Startup Village Entrepreneurship Programme. So effective and frequent has been the communication that many elderly now personally contact the resource persons when faced with problems.  We are accommodating as many members as possible in the meetings, though those without smartphones cannot join.

Civic bodies that passed the government test on solid waste management will sign the agreement with the company in the first phase, according to officials. Clean Kerala Company decided not to receive unsegregated waste, as it had been causing logistical and financial strain on the already burdened waste collection and transportation mechanism amid the pandemic crisis. The government had asked local bodies to hand over non-biodegradable waste to the company after material collection facilities in panchayats were filled up with piles of unsegregated waste from March-end.temporary measure. Temporary measure The Environment Department had permitted Clean Kerala Company to transport waste to the hazardous waste treatment facility of Kerala Enviro Infrastructure Ltd. at Ambalamedu as a temporary measure. But the Central Pollution Control Board had warned against dumping solid waste at landfill sites earmarked for hazardous waste. The government wanted local bodies to reap the advantages of increasing their earnings through sale of segregated waste. The authorities had published rates per kg of each non-biodegradable item. Haritha Karma Sena members are now being encouraged to cash in on the demand for segregated materials among vendors involved in recycling. Civic bodies can bring down the expenditure for transporting unsegregated waste, as Clean Kerala Company will impose additional charge for such waste. Local bodies will also have to pay up for handing over waste that cannot be recycled to the company. A list of such waste materials will be published in advance by the company. Local bodies will get money from the company for segregated waste stored at the material collection facilities. It will be transferred to the bank account mentioned by civic bodies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/local-bodies-to-segregate-non-biodegradable-waste/article32825166.ece
11 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Thripunithura-Poothotta road widening on anvil||With the Kochi metro slated to be extended to Thripunithura SN Junction by 2021 and up to the terminal station proposed near the railway station, preparatory work to widen the narrow SN Junction-Poothotta stretch is under way. The proposed development of the 15-km road as a 22-metre-wide, four-lane corridor will end the perennial traffic hold-ups on the busy Thripunithura-Vaikom road. A sum of Rs. 300 crore had been allotted for the project in the 2019 Budget. The final alignment is ready, official sources said. Thripunithura Rajanagari Union of Residents’ Associations (TRURA) has sought tangible measures to realise the long-overdue road development project and resurfacing of the entire corridor. “The government must also allot funds to complete missing links on Seaport-Airport Road and widen it,” said V.C. Jayendran, convenor, TRURA. Narrow roads, mostly owned by the PWD, abound in the town, which was the headquarters of the erstwhile Kochi Kingdom. The government must allot funds to ensure their widening. Decades of indecision has resulted in the 8-km Thripunithura bypass project being a non-starter, said sources in PWD. The project ran into trouble in 2019 when survey stones were reportedly laid beyond the areas that were frozen for land acquisition, following which there were instances of landowners allegedly manhandling workers engaged in the work. The Thripunithura Municipality had frozen construction activity or sale of land located within 16.5 metres from the centre of the SN Junction-Poothotta road.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/thripunithura-poothotta-road-widening-on-anvil/article32825595.ece

The whole of Thripunithura and its surroundings are currently being served by the City Traffic Police - East, based at Edappally. “Police personnel from here often find it difficult to attend to traffic hold-ups and accidents in Thripunithura and nearby areas. Their jurisdiction thus extends to around 20 km from the traffic station. Locales in the city need swift response from the police,” said G. Poonguzhali, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic, Law and Order), who is slated to join her new stint shortly as SP of Wayanad district. “Moreover, personnel from Edappally have to manage traffic on the busy NH and other stretches in the city hub like Edappally, Palarivattom, and Kaloor. Under these circumstances, we have sent a proposal to the police headquarters, seeking bifurcation of areas under the Traffic Police - East,” she added. While city traffic - east and west is headed by officers in the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Thripunithura might be headed by an ACP or a Circle Inspector, it is learnt. Specialist wings The east wing of the traffic police has, in the meantime, deputed its personnel under three wings, to make optimal use of manpower. Each wing is taking care of road engineering, traffic regulation, and rule-enforcement aspects. Personnel of the engineering wing thus keep tab of manpower deployment, based on road and traffic conditions. They also track accident spots and suggest new infra like medians, pedestrian-crossing lines, signal systems, or modifications to existing infra like unscientifically-located U-turns. They also monitor CCTV footage, to keep tab of rule violations and to ascertain the cause of accidents. Traffic police have also been introducing reforms, based on first-hand observation of how personnel of the Hyderabad City police function. Over the past year-and-a-half, the police identified 38 bottlenecks that hindered free flow of vehicles, based on a study conducted across the city and its immediate suburbs. Steps were taken to overcome most of these hurdles, she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/third-traffic-police-station-in-city-may-come-up-at-thripunithura/article32825592.ece

Initially, the Kudumbashree formed 441 NHGs on a pilot basis in just five panchayats in the Mulanthuruthy block panchayat — Edakkattuvayal, Maneedu, Mulanthuruthy, Amballoor and Udayamperoor — under the Elderly Inclusion project of the National Rural Livelihood Mission in November 2015. Unlike other Kudumbashree NHGs, which are the preserve of women alone, NHGs for the elderly were open to both men and women aged 60 and above. In due course, the number of beneficiaries under the project rose to 6,548 and they collectively set up 206 micro enterprises. The main goal of the project was to provide a better social security net for vulnerable elders in the rural areas through health care, social protection, psycho-social care, livelihood support and other age-appropriate services in order to ensure an active, healthy, and dignified life. “The success of the project encouraged the formation of such elderly NHGs across the district. We were in the process of scaling up their activities and forming micro enterprises and joint liability groups for group farming when the pandemic set in and disrupted the activities,” said Ponni Kannan, district programme manager who is also in charge of the NHGs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nhgs-run-by-seniors-thrive-in-district/article32825590.ece

The metro agency undertook the project in 2019, on the orders of the State government and awarded the work to Antea Nederland BV (Netherlands) for the development of concept, master planning, and detailed design. The six major canals in the city that will be revived under the initiative are Edappally canal, Chilavannoor canal, Thevara-Perandoor canal, Thevara canal, Market canal, and Konthuruthy canal. “The surveys were completed within a short span of time. A detailed project report has been prepared and submitted for approval to the State government. We have lined up the course of action, including cleaning of canals, rehabilitation of people affected by the project, shore protection, and canal-oriented developments, thus bringing life back to these canals,” said Alkesh Kumar Sharma, managing director, KMRL. “Through this project, we will bring these canals back to their erstwhile glory when they were navigable [and used to move people and cargo]. We are also looking forward to developing more lung spaces along the banks of these canals,” said Mr. Sharma, who is also the Additional Chief Secretary for Special Projects. The metro agency completed the advanced LIDAR survey, for getting topographic details and to map sub-drains from which water enters the canals. It also completed the mandatory Social Impact Assessment (SIA), water quality studies, and Bathymetric Survey. Geotechnical bore-hole investigation at 56 identified locations, for understanding soil characteristics and lithology along the canals is nearing completion. A major portion of floodplain analysis and water-balancing studies is being done in the Netherlands and are expected to be completed by the end of this month, KMRL said in a press release. The metro agency had submitted an application before the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, and the Ministry has sanctioned the terms of reference for various mandatory clearances to be obtained, since the project area falls under the CRZ zone. The Kerala State Pollution Control Board has approved the Consent to Establish (CTE), while wildlife clearance is expected shortly from the Forest Department. The application for wetland clearance has been submitted to the Kochi Corporation. Land identification and acquisition proposals too are progressing fast. As part of the social upliftment aspects of the project, people residing along the canal banks will be resettled in a full-fledged housing complex that will be built at Kakkanad to accommodate them. As part of urban regeneration, KMRL has plans to implement Canal Oriented Development (COD) projects. The activities included are initial cleaning, widening, deepening to maintain the cross-section for flood mitigation and navigation, and bank protection. While striving to make the canals navigable to the possible extent, there will be inter-modal connectivity with the Kochi metro, Water Metro, and the road network.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/survey-over-for-water-transport-system/article32825587.ece

The book elaborates on the role and opportunities available for green volunteers. The Local Self-Government Department has rolled out training programmes for them in various districts to explore the various avenues available for income generation. In Ernakulam, the lead members of the various Haritha Karma Sena units had attended the first phase of the training programme. “Besides highlighting the role played by them in ensuring proper collection of non-biodegradable waste, the handbook has included detailed information on their potential to create a culture of sorting and segregating such waste at source itself. The training programme had focused on the importance of segregation of non-biodegradable waste, as it enhanced the income generation capabilities of Haritha Karma Sena members,” said Sujith Karun, district co-ordinator, Haritha Keralam Mission. The handbook has included the estimated prices of recyclable waste, besides pointing out the value-addition ventures that could be undertaken by green volunteers. They get user fee for collecting waste from households and commercial establishments. The members also get money after the sale of recyclable waste to agencies like Clean Kerala Company.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/handbook-comes-in-handy-for-volunteers/article32825599.ece
11 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Intelligent traffic management for Kochi||A Rs. 26-crore Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) to streamline traffic movement and to aid in rule enforcement in Kochi will be inaugurated on October 19 by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan through videoconferencing. The funding is from Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML), while Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation (Keltron) set up the necessary infrastructure. ITMS will also enable pedestrians to easily cross the road at a few busy areas in the city. The key technology-based initiatives include vehicle-actuated signals, pedestrian-operated pelican signal system which will help them safely cross the road, area-traffic management in three modes, a surveillance-camera network capable of taking high-resolution images even at night and in rainy weather, a system at 35 junctions to track vehicles which jump the red signal, and a control room at the Revenue Tower to monitor and coordinate vehicle movement. Actuated signals installed at 21 locales in Kochi will prevent the need for vehicles to wait unnecessarily at signal points. The system will automatically give preference to vehicles coming from the direction where traffic is more. The radar-based signal system will thus ensure optimal use of road space. Pelican signals have been placed on Shamugham Road, Menaka Junction, Kaloor, and Edappally. Data collection The data thus generated will help in planning traffic management measures, if need be, with the help of agencies like NATPAC. Other key advantages include collection of traffic data like average speed, vehicle flow, and queue length, which will help in urban and traffic planning. An automated e-challan system and signages capable of displaying variable messages too are part of the project. Keltron will maintain the infrastructure for a five-year period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/soon-intelligent-traffic-management-in-city/article32825593.ece

The new patients include 1,083 local contact cases, 10 health workers, five persons with no known source of infection, and nine who had travelled from other States. The Health Department has also confirmed that the deaths of a 76-year-old Kollam resident and a 53-year-old Anchal resident were due to COVID-19. Cases with no known source have been reported from Asramam, Mundakkal East, Chavara, Chithara, and Perayam. The number of recoveries on Saturday is 1,022. According to Health officials, around 6,000 tests are done in the district every day and all private facilities have been given strict instructions to inform the department about the tests they conduct. In coastal regions, positive cases will be shifted to special first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) if they the patients cannot maintain proper isolation protocol at homes. “They will be provided all the facilities including teleconsultation,” said Deputy DMO R. Sandhya. Reverse quarantine The department is also planning to provide reverse quarantine provision in some areas if the number of positive cases are higher. “Local bodies can arrange accommodation for the non-patients. We are also encouraging the public to wear masks at home if any member of the family is going out to work.” At present the department has strengthened the surveillance of symptomatic cases, closely monitoring the patients and asking them to follow the protocol till the results are out. If they test positive, their primary contacts will be traced and tested immediately. “Several persons from the same workplace are testing positive of late and this means some of them are not following the protocols. They share common space without physical distancing and properly wearing masks,” she said. More dialysis facilities Since the number of patients requiring dialysis is on the rise, the department has arranged additional provisions at the facilities in Neendakara, Nedungolam, Kadakkal, and Kollam District Hospital. “There are practical difficulties in conducting the dialysis for COVID and non-COVID patients at the same hospital. The department has added extra shifts in dialysis units at the government facilities in these places so that there is no overload at Government Medical College Hospital, Kollam.” Kollam currently has 19,245 persons under observation and the total number of samples collected is 2,55,543. While 2,092 persons completed home quarantine on Saturday, the Health Department has traced 53,100 primary and 6,904 secondary contacts of the patients. Kollam currently has 8,244 active cases and 13 COVID-19 FLTCs are functioning in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kollams-daily-tally-crosses-1000/article32825161.ece
11 October 2020||KOLLAM,KERALA||KMML to get more oxygen self-reliant||The Kerala Minerals and Metals Limited (KMML) has become self-reliant in oxygen production with a new 70-tonne per day (TPD) plant inaugurated online by Chief Minister Pinaryi Vijayan on Saturday. “Along with the oxygen needed for industrial purposes, the plant will also cater to the health sector, making the new facility extremely advantageous under current circumstances,” said the Chief Minister in his inaugural address. He said the government had been implementing comprehensive renovation and upgrading works in the public sector since chemical industry in the State had great possibilities. “A mineral separation unit was installed at the KMML at a cost of Rs. 10 crore after the LDF government came into power. While the KMML had registered a profit of Rs. 3 crore in 2015-16, in 2017-18 the profit jumped to a record Rs. 151 crore. In 2018-19, the profit was Rs. 163 crore and even in the midst of a severe crisis, the unit achieved a profit of Rs. 42 crore in the 2019-20 financial year,” he said. When commissioned in 1984, the production capacity of the Titanium dioxide Pigment (TP) unit in the KMML was 22,000 tonnes. A 50-TPD oxygen plant corresponding to the demand was also commissioned along with the unit, but the pigment production capacity of the unit considerably escalated around 1999-2000. When it reached 36,000 tonnes per year, the oxygen plant fell inadequate to meet the 63 tonnes a day demand, and by this time the capacity had come down to 35 tonnes from the original 50 tonnes. After this, the KMML had to buy 26 tonnes of oxygen per day from other manufacturers to meet the surge in demand and since then, the KMML has been spending around Rs. 12 crore per year for purchasing oxygen. The new completely automatic 70 TDP plant with high energy efficiency was completed with Rs. 50 crore including Rs. 4 crore sanctioned for civil works. If the production cost of one tonne oxygen in the earlier plant was Rs. 7,000, the new plant can produce the same quantity with Rs. 4,500. The liquid oxygen produced at the plant can be used for medical needs and now the KMML can augment medical oxygen supply if the health sector faces shortage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kmml-to-get-more-oxygen-self-reliant/article32825156.ece

Mani-led faction, party working chairman P.J. Joseph on Saturday asserted that the status quo with regard to the division of seats would be maintained. Addressing mediapersons in Kottayam to announce the party’s plan to hold dharnas at all district headquarters on October 14 seeking a universal pension of Rs. 10,000, Mr. Joseph said the coalition had not commenced discussions on seat allocation to the constituent parties of the UDF. “We do not think the Congress would ask for seats where the KC(M) has been contesting traditionally. There is no change in the situation from the previous election when the KC(M) had contested in 15 Assembly seats. While Mr. Mani and a few others have left the party, a large number of leaders, including Francis George, Johnny Nellore, and Joseph M. Puthusseri, have joined our ranks,” he said. ‘A boat adrift’ Mr. Joseph termed the faction led by Mr. Mani a boat adrift on the sea. “It may capsize any moment as nobody will accept a ship that is about to sink. While Mr. Mani had earlier stated he would announce its political stance on Friday, he is still unsure about the future course of action,” he said. Earlier, Mr. Joseph had alleged that Mr. Mani was eyeing a berth in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. The report, however, drew a rebuttal from the Mani group, with N. Jayaraj, MLA, accusing Mr. Joseph of misleading the public. “Mr. Joseph’s statement that he has got this information from the BJP leaders itself shows his connections with that party,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-talks-on-seat-allocation-joseph/article32825189.ece

The order dated August 25, 2020, offering 4% reservation for people from various categories of differently abled in common category posts in government offices is being questioned by the All Kerala Association of the Deaf (AKAD) on grounds that it has violated the tenets of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016 by denying jobs to people who are completely deaf. V.A. Yusuf, State chairman of Deaf Employees Forum and State secretary of AKAD, said people who were 70% to 100% hearing impaired were not qualified for any of the jobs listed under the order. He alleged that the order deemed mandatory for the hearing impaired to be able to function normally with the help of hearing aids or cochlear implants to be found qualified for the jobs. “The completely deaf have not been allotted any jobs, not even that of a sweeper. A lot of completely deaf people are doing several government jobs efficiently at present, while the same jobs are being denied to them through this order,” said Mr. Yusuf. The RPWD Act had maintained that sign language should be popularised to help the deaf be part of mainstream society. However, the State government had taken a shortcut by imposing hearing aids and cochlear implants on the deaf instead, he said.

11 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Hand-washing units fall into disuse||Without proper maintenance, hand-washing points and sanitiser dispenser units set up in various places in the city to promote the government’s ‘Break the Chain’ campaign have almost disappeared. Public taps and soap dispensers that were common and fully functional during the national lockdown period have been rendered unusable. Though a number of residents’ associations, local clubs and citizens’ forums were active in setting up water taps across the city, the practice is on the decline even within Kozhikode Corporation limits, where COVID-19 cases are on the rise. At present, usable taps and soap dispensers are not available even near bus shelters. The efforts of some autorickshaw drivers to set up portable hand-washing units in their vehicles too have come to an end. Though such initiatives were highlighted as models in fighting COVID-19, they lost steam midway. Merchants and autorickshaw drivers in the city said people were disinclined to use public taps since hand sanitisers had gained popularity and were easy to use. Sanitiser dispensers are now available in front of all shops in the city. Office-bearers of a youth club said they tried to set up public taps and soap dispensers during the lockdown days mainly to spread awareness about the need for personal hygiene. The Corporation authorities, meanwhile, said they would encourage the proper maintenance and continuation of all such existing units as they would be useful for many in the absence of other sanitising options. They claimed that many non-functional public taps were recently repaired and soap dispensers were being refilled regularly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hand-washing-units-fall-into-disuse/article32825079.ece
11 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Tipper lorry operators go on flash strike||A section of tipper lorry owners and drivers on Saturday began a flash strike in Kozhikode district, alleging that the recent series of inspections by the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) squad in the name of exposing illegal transportation of quarry products were meant to torture them. The strike was called in the wake of the alleged suicide attempt by a driver from Mukkom who was caught for overloading on Thursday. Following the VACB report, the Geology Department had reportedly asked him to remit a fine of Rs. 50,000 to compound the offence. He allegedly attempted to end his life on Friday by consuming poison. A lorry owner from Mukkom, which is known for the presence of a large number of granite quarries, said there were no accurate weighing mechanisms available in any of the large-scale quarry units. The operators concerned should be held accountable in case of overloading, as drivers cannot be held responsible for it in the absence of proper weighing and measuring facilities, he added. The protesters also alleged that the VACB inspection did not hold any quarry operators accountable for alleged overloading. Drivers are going through acute financial crisis with containment zone regulations, and the VACB team had compounded their crisis, they claimed. Meanwhile, expressing solidarity with tipper lorry owners and drivers, Muslim Youth League (MYL) workers from Mukkom Municipality and Karassery panchayats staged a protest, seeking legal action against the VACB squad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tipper-lorry-owners-allege-torture-by-vacb-go-on-flash-strike/article32825081.ece

Nine traders who tried to oppose police action in the micro-containment zone were taken into custody. They were charged under various sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act. A case was also registered against the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti leaders who allegedly called for opening shops in the micro-containment zone. More policemen were deployed at the spot as traders tried to intensify the protest with the support of merchants from other locations.

11 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Hygiene Status for 45 local bodies||Local bodies in Kozhikode district have maintained hygiene and sanitation well as prescribed by the Haritha Keralam Mission (HKM). As a result, 45 of them received the ‘Hygiene Status’ from Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday. Hygiene Status is conferred on local bodies scoring at least 60% marks in sanitation, based on HKM norms. Three municipalities and 39 grama panchayats, besides the Kozhikode Corporation, have achieved Hygiene Status in the district. Vadakara, Mukkom, and Koyilandy are the municipalities, while all grama panchayats under the Vadakara and Kunnummal blocks have achieved the feat. The grama panchayats in the Vadakara block are Eramala, Azhiyur, Onchiyam, and Chorode, while those in the Kunnummal block are Kuttiadi, Kunnummal, Maruthonkara, Kavilumpara, Velam, Kayakkodi, and Narippatta. Besides, Ulliyeri, Naduvannur, Balussery, Kottoor, and Panangad in Balussery block; Perambra, Cheruvannur, Changaroth, and Chakkittapara in Perambra block; Madavoor, Thiruvambady, and Koodaranhi in Koduvally block; Karasseri, Chathamangalam, Kuruvattur, Mavoor, Perumanna, and Peruvayal in Kunnamangalam block; Meppayur in Meladi block; Valayam in Thooneri block; Vilyappalli and Maniyur in Thodannur block; Atholi, Arikkulam, and Chemancheri in Panthalayani block; Kakkodi in Chelannur block, and Kadalundi and Olavanna in Kozhikode block have achieved the status. Fully functional material recovery facility, material collection facilities, source-level waste management system in every home, functional public toilets, adherence to the green protocol during public events, implementation of solid waste management rules, and plastic ban are some factors behind selection for Hygiene Status. Vadakara Municipality with 93 marks is the topper among urban local bodies in the district, while Azhiyoor with 92 marks tops among grama panchayats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hygiene-status-conferred-on-45-local-bodies-in-kozhikode/article32825065.ece
11 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Care centre for MDR-TB patients||A one-acre plot near the Institute of Palliative Medicine on the campus of the Government Medical College, Kozhikode, has been identified for the proposed rescue and rehabilitation home for patients diagnosed with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in the district. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), those with MDR TB do not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, the most powerful anti-TB drugs, because the bacteria that causes TB could develop resistance to these anti-microbial drugs. P.P. Pramod Kumar, District TB Officer, told The Hindu on Saturday that 19 persons were undergoing treatment for the disease in Kozhikode now. Dr. Pramod, who is also the officer in charge of AIDS control, said the centre would also be used for those who need in-patient treatment for AIDS. The facility for AIDS patients is coming up with the help of the Snehasparsham project of the Kozhikode District Panchayat. A project on MDR-TB patients had been submitted to the National Health Mission, Dr. Pramod said. Incorrect use of drugs The WHO points out that mismanagement of treatment and person-to-person transmission are the two main reasons for the emergence and spread of MDR TB. Most people get cured by a strict six-month drug regime, along with support and supervision. “Inappropriate or incorrect use of antimicrobial drugs, or use of ineffective formulations of drugs [such as use of single drugs, poor quality medicines or bad storage conditions], and premature treatment interruption can cause drug resistance, which can then be transmitted, especially in crowded settings such as prisons and hospitals,” says the WHO. Dr. Pramod said those under treatment include both senior citizens and youngsters. Last year, there were 33 patients, and 14 of them had completed treatment, he added. People with MDR TB could transmit the disease to hundreds, if they travel in public places. Dr. Pramod said some patients were spotted during the house survey held as part of the State government’s TB elimination mission. Official sources said earlier that the centre would help those patients who could not earn a living by doing a job. Some were bed-ridden whose families look at them as a burden. There are others who need long-term treatment. The proposed rescue shelter could have facilities for their treatment and some occupational therapy, the source said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/plot-identified-for-mdr-tb-patients-care-centre/article32825076.ece

11 October 2020||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||Nod for light vehicles to ply on Sabarimala road||Though the repair works of the road leading to Sabarimala are yet to begin, authorities have decided to permit light vehicles along the road when the temple opens on October 16 for the Thulam puja. The plan to restore the road, damaged in the heavy rain in August, was dealt a major blow with the e-tender floated by the Public Works Department receiving zero bids. Following this, the agency has tendered the works once again, which will open on October 13. “If the response continues to be lukewarm, the works will be awarded directly,” said Sheena Rajan, Executive Engineer, PWD (Roads) Pathanamthitta. The stoppage of traffic through the route has considerably affected the preparations at Pampa and the Sannidhanam for the upcoming pilgrim season. However, light vehicles carrying officials of the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) and the police still ply along the road. Because of a ban on the bathing of pilgrims at Pampa, the authorities will set up 20 bathing facilities at Pampa-Triveni. While the Irrigation Department will install sprinklers and related plumbing works, the Kerala Water Authority will ensure water supply. The TDB has been asked to ensure that waste water does not enter the river or other waterbodies. Officials said the showers and the make-shift bathrooms would be set up in line with the physical distancing guidelines. Water discharged from these facilities will be stored in a tank and diverted to the waste-water treatment plant.  New sprinklers Kottayam Collector M. Anjana has directed the TDB to install a new set of sprinklers at Erumely to ensure that waste water from these showers are not discharged into the Valiyathodu, a stream that opens to the Manimalayar. Pilgrims have been also prohibited from staying overnight at the stop-overs (Idathavalams) en route to Sabarimala, including Erumely. A ban has been imposed on performing Petta Thullal in groups comprising over five persons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nod-for-light-vehicles-to-ply-on-sabarimala-road/article32825187.ece

11 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||No move to centralise executive power: CM||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday denied a media report that the government had moved to concentrate the executive power with the Chief Minister’s Office by amending the rules of business that govern day-to-day administration. He also termed mere speculation a suggestion in the news report that at least four of his Cabinet colleagues and coalition partners had objected to the move. Panel formed Mr. Vijayan said that on December 28, 2018 the government had constituted a committee comprising five top bureaucrats to examine the rules of business, single out anomalies, if any, and recommend revisions if necessary. On August 26, 2020 the Cabinet considered the set of recommendations tabled by the committee of bureaucrats. It decided to constitute a Cabinet subcommittee to study the proposals in detail. Members The Cabinet nominated Law Minister A.K. Balan as convener of the subcommittee. It named Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan, Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran, Minister for Ports Kadannappally Ramachandran, and Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty as members. The subcommittee was yet to submit its report. The newspaper report had suggested that the coalition Ministers had objected to any amendments to the rules of business because they feared it would undermine their authority and concentrate executive power with the Chief Minister and heads of departments. Mr. Vijayan said the report was mere speculation. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala had said any alteration of the rules of business would undermine democracy and bolster authoritarianism. It would do away with checks and balances in the system and promote the arbitrary exercise of executive power.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-move-to-centralise-executive-power-cm/article32825172.ece

The day’s caseload has far surpassed the previous highest count of 1,182 reported on October 7. The death toll due to the pandemic also jumped to 297 with nine more people succumbing to the disease. Those who died including natives of Poovachal (aged 51 years old), Manacaud (79), Kuruvilpuram near Kallikadu (70), Kovalam (82), Peroorkada (60), Poovachal (47), Pettah (76) and Thirumala (61). The death of prominent fishing community leader T. Peter, who hailed from Valiyaveli, has also been included in the list. He had died in the Government Medical College Hospital here on October 8. As many as 1,288 out of those who tested positive during the last 24 hours contracted the infection through local transmission. The health authorities were yet to trace the source of infection in 226 cases among them. Twenty health workers have also been infected. Cases continued to grow among the vulnerable age groups with 193 senior citizens aged above 60 years and 142 children below 15 years getting the disease. The number of active COVID-19 cases in the district stood at 12,127 on a day when 905 people were discharged after recovering from the disease. While 4,483 people were directed to go into quarantine on the day, the number of those who are currently being monitored for COVID-19-related difficulties is 31,510. Pointing out that the COVID-19 situation remained grave, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan during his briefing said that the mounting case burden in the capital district witnessed a greater number of women contracting the illness. He pointed to the possibility of women frequenting markets and shopping malls in large numbers as the reason behind the trend. Appeal While reiterating the importance of auto and taxi drivers ensuring the constant use of face masks and hand sanitisers, the Chief Minister also urged them to consider wearing gloves and face shield for improved protection. He also appealed to the public to exercise caution while using public transportation. In view of the permission granted to commercial establishments to function, Mr. Vijayan directed shop owners to maintain availability of soaps and hand sanitisers for customers. Panic gripped the Museum police station in the city where three officials tested positive, taking the total number of police personnel affected to 29. Authorities deployed staff from other stations and wings to ensure the activities of the station remained unaffected. Meanwhile, the district administration formally launched the Santhwana Sparsham scheme to undertake COVID-19 testing at the homes of bed-ridden people who have registered for palliative care.

11 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||45% work of Kazhakuttam flyover over||Nearly 45% of the work of the upcoming 2.7-km four-lane flyover at Kazhakuttam for hassle-free entry to Technopark has been completed. The 12 slabs in the initial 1.7 km from Technopark to Kazhakuttam of the flyover that will pass along National Highway (NH) 66 and NH 66 Bypass extending to Karode on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border had been completed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). Demolition With the government handing over the land in the remaining one km stretch from Kazhakuttam, the NHAI is in the process of demolishing the buildings in the surrendered land and expediting the work of flyover being executed as a standalone project. “The demolishing of the remaining three buildings is to be completed next week,” a NHAI official said. Due to the delay in handing over the land, the NHAI had begun the work on the 1.7-km stretch from Technopark to save time. The delay was over acquiring land on the stretch from Kazhakuttam for a Right of Way (RoW) of 45 m for the flyover. The Kochi-based Cherian Varkey Construction Company that had bagged the work for Rs. 195 crore on April 5, 2019 and continued with the work during the lockdown is facing hurdles to expedite the work as the traffic is not being diverted. Traffic diversions as promised by the authorities had not taken place and this will hamper works, he said. Initially, it was decided to have a 1.4-km flyover. Later it was decided to go for a 2.34-km flyover that will terminate near the Kazhakuttam police station. Extension The decision to extend it up to CSI Mission Hospital was taken considering the Kazhakuttam station of the proposed 21.82-km Light Metro corridor from Technocity to Karamana; convention centre on the stretch; future traffic volume with urbanisation; and the four-laning of the Kazhakuttam-Cherthala NH 66 corridor. The flyover, the longest in the capital on commissioning, is to come up on 60 piers, each 30 m apart. Only three piers are pending, the official said. The pillars coming up in the median along the four-lane NH 66 will have a diameter of four metres and the main carriageway will be 21 m. The four-lane flyover is being executed under the Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) mode. Only 56 per cent of the land against the 90 per cent was handed over when the work started on April 6, 2019. “Despite the odds, the pace of work has been good. We are planning to complete the work by April 2021,” the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/45-work-of-kazhakuttam-flyover-over/article32825728.ece
11 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Tourism sector upbeat as opening nears||An upbeat mood prevails in the travel trade over the proposed opening of the tourism sector in the State from October 15 after six months of dampened activity following the COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdown. Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran had announced that initially hill stations and places where visitors can be restricted would be opened. The stakeholders of the badly hit industry are expecting good response. Positive signals The arrival of the visitors to the hill resort of Ponmudi, near here, and to popular destinations in Wayanad during weekends, and the interest shown by leading online travel portals like MakeMytrip, Goibibo and Booking.com on Kerala despite the uncertainties have been projected as positive signals for the revival of the tourism sector in the days ahead. However, the decision to postpone the opening of bars, notification of Munnar as a containment zone, and insistence on testing at the border check-post of Muthanga for those coming from Karnataka are concerns for the stakeholders. “The demand is for short tours. Our properties are ready to cater to the visitors. Rooms in the Ponmudi resort are sold out during weekends. An increase in the number of trains and flights will give confidence for people to travel,” an official of the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) said. Many enquiries Hotels that remain closed and local travel agents are preparing to receiving guests. “Enquiries have started coming from northern States. Small groups have started booking for arrivals in November and December. We are reserving them with the tag that everything will be subject to government guidelines,” says Abraham George, CMD of the Kochi-based Intersight Tours & Travel. The demand for the rooms in the properties that opened up in Wayanad from those in northern districts has surprised the industry. “Wayanad during the weekend is sold out, as holidayers from Bengaluru have also started arriving. Bachelors and families are arriving in good numbers,” says Prasad Manjali, MD and CEO, Citrine Hotels and Resorts. No beaches at first Meanwhile, the opening of the sector has not brought much cheer for the stakeholders at Kovalam as beaches do not figure in the initial opening phase.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tourism-sector-upbeat-as-opening-nears/article32825183.ece
11 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Pandemic curve worrisome, says Pinarayi||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has stressed the need for more effective disease containment measures in the coming weeks so that the COVID-19 pandemic curve does not hit the peak too soon, resulting in more fatalities. Addressing mediapersons here on Saturday, he said the test positivity rate was remaining high even when the number of tests had been increased substantially and that this was an indication that the curve would continue to rise in October-November. Interventions helped The State had successfully managed to keep the disease extended, without hitting the peak so that the surge was below the health system capacity and the case fatality rate could be kept down. The State's interventions in disease containment has helped create a lag in the pace of the pandemic, giving the State adequate time for preparedness, he said. However, the past eight months have taken a toll on health-care workers in the State, who are very much fatigued. Though the COVID Brigade had been created for aiding the health-care workers, doctors of modern medicine who have joined the brigade are only 543. Mr. Vijayan again reminded people to take over the responsibility of keeping themselves protected against the disease by following all safety precautions. In Thiruvananthapuram, women seemed to be crowding malls and supermarkets and this had resulted in more women contracting the disease. In Malappuram, renal patients, who contract the disease, were being denied dialysis services and this would invite strict action. All private hospitals should set aside one dialysis machine exclusively for COVID patients and a dialysis patient who is SARS-CoV-2 positive may be referred to the Manjeri medical college only in dire situations, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pandemic-curve-worrisome-says-pinarayi/article32825171.ece
11 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||City Corpn., local bodies in district get ‘clean’ status||The city Corporation found a place among the local bodies that were accorded the ‘clean’ status on Saturday. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan declared ‘clean’ status for 501 grama panchayats and 58 municipalities, as part of the 100-day action plan. Following the declaration through videoconference, Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran presented the award and the citation to Mayor K.Sreekumar at the Corporation office. Mr.Surendran said that the achievements of the Corporation in implementing a robust decentralised waste management system after the closure of the centralised waste treatment plant at Vilappilsala is a model worth following. The model has won accolades at the national and international levels. Earth Day award The Mayor said that the Corporation had also recently won the Earth Day Network Star Municipal Leadership Award, instituted by the Earth Day Network, a non-profit organisation which organises the annual observance of Earth Day. He said that the recognition from the State government as well as the other awards will spur the civic body for further efforts in this sphere. The city Corporation, which was dependent on a centralised system till the closure of the Vilappilsala plant in 2011, made a shift to decentralised waste management systems, with the setting up of aerobic bins for community waste composting at the ward levels and by the distribution of kitchen bins for waste treatment at the household level. Collection points were also opened for non-biodegradable waste. These are taken to material recovery facilities, from where it is handed over to various agencies for recycling purposes. The City Corporation also organises periodic collection of non-biodegradable waste. It has also set up a licensing system for septage waste collection and disposal, which has put an end to dumping of septage waste in water bodies and in public spaces. In the district, 47 grama panchayats, five municipalities and five block panchayats were declared as clean. Other than the city Corporation, Varkala, Attingal, Nedumangad and Neyyatinkara municipalities and Parassala, Kilimanoor, Varkala, Nedumangad and Vellanad block panchayats were given the clean status. Winners The winners among the grama panchayats are Parassala, Chenkal, Karode, Kulathoor, Poovar, Karumkulam, Kanjiramkulam, Athiyannur, Kollayil, Perunkadavila, Kallikkadu, Aryankode, Poovachal, Vellanad, Tholikode, Vithura, Kattakada, Malayinkeezh, Balaramapuram, Aruvikkara, Karakulam, Anad, Vembayam, Peringamala, Pangode, Vamanapuram, Nandiyode, Manikkal, Andoorkonam, Mangalapuram, Kizhuvilam, Vakkam, Manamboor, Chemmaruthi, Ottoor, Edava, Elakamon, Cherunniyoor, Madavoor, Karavaram, Pazhayakunnummel, Pulimath, Navayikkulam, Pallikkal and Nagaroor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/city-corpn-local-bodies-in-district-get-clean-status/article32825740.ece

PNDT clinics will continue to be monitored, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja has said. In a message in connection with International Day of the Girl Child on Sunday, the Minister said the State had looked into the fall in the number of girls from birth to age six in recent times. Strict steps were being taken to prevent crimes against girls which undermined the social and cultural gains made by the State, the Minister said. Ending of any overt caste discrimination and achievement in girl child education and other social changes had brought women and girls in the State into the social mainstream. Increase in female literacy, 78% presence of women in higher education, their significant presence in professional education had all helped improve gender equality. The State was also ahead in sex ratio, with 1,000 males to 1,084 females. The setting up of a separate department for women and children in 2017-18 had also helped focus attention on their issues. A number of projects had been rolled out for them by the government. Crimes against children were being reported on the helpline 1517. ‘Karuthal Sparsham Kaikorkkam Kuttikalkayi’ campaign was launched to prevent crimes against children. The services of school counsellors, awareness programmes for adolescent girls, and setting up of 17 of the 28 fast-track courts had also benefited girl children. However, incidents such as sexual abuse of a student by her teacher, rape of a woman by the ambulance driver, exploitation of young girls by elderly men or cyber crimes indicated the need for stronger interventions so that girls could be assured of equality in society and opportunities to display their talents and personality to the full, the Minister said.   Strict steps are being taken to prevent crimes against girls which undermine the social and cultural gains made by the State K.K.

11 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Chennithala seeks action against police||Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Saturday demanded stringent action against the police officers responsible for the shoddy investigation into the death of two Dalit sisters, both minors, at Walayar in Palakkad district in 2017. In a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Mr. Chennithala said the law enforcement had come under criticism from across the political spectrum after a special court for the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) acquitted three persons accused of having sexually exploited the children and abetted their suicide. Want of proof The court had cited failure on the part of the prosecution and want of evidence as grounds for the acquittal. The wilful indifference on the part of the police to the plight of the indigent Dalit family had driven the parents of the girls to the street to seek justice for their wards, Mr. Chennithala said. The parents were on an indefinite protest in front of the Secretariat. Mr. Chennithala visited them and expressed solidarity with their struggle. The CPI had criticised the police for their “lack of empathy.” Janayugam , the party run newspaper, had penned a scathing editorial damning the police failure to bring the abusers to book. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had championed the cause of the Dalit family. BJP activists had staged a march to the district police headquarters in Palakkad. BJP State president K. Surendran had alleged that the police had developed cold feet in the case because the main accused were local apparatchiks of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)]. The parents had also made a similar allegation. They had even doubted whether the girls, who were 10 and 12 at the time of their unnatural death, could have committed suicide. They had said they suspected that the accused could have murdered the children to evade prosecution. Conflict of interest Mr. Chennithala said the lawyer who defended the accused in the case was also a local CPI(M) man who officiated as chairperson of the District Child Welfare Committee. He said it pointed to collusion and potential conflict of interest. The United Democratic F and the BJP demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation inquiry in the case. Director General of Prosecution Manjeri Sreedharan Nair has reportedly given a similar opinion after he found flaws on the part of the prosecution.  The parents are on an indefinite protest in front of the Secretariat||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chennithala-seeks-action-against-police-officers/article32825164.ece
11 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||New woody herb species found||A team of researchers have reported a new species of perennial woody herb of the genus Lepidagathis from the northern laterite plateaus of Kasaragod district. Since this rare plant is spotted in the neighbourhood of the Ananthapura lake temple, it has been named Lepidagathis ananthapuramensis after the famed temple dedicated to Ananthapadmanabha. An article on the discovery authored by P. Biju of Government College, Kasaragod; V.S. Anil Kumar and S. Arya of University College, Thiruvananthapuram; E.J. Josekutty, Government Brennen College, Thalassery; and Jomy Augustine, St Thomas College, Pala; has been published in the latest edition of Phytotaxa , a journal on plant taxonomy. The plant has been spotted during field explorations, Mr. Anil Kumar said. With this, the number of species of the genus Lepidagathis (family Acanthaceae) found in India has risen to 34. “Plants of this species are locally called ‘paramullu’. Lepidagathis ananthapuramensis is endemic to the region,” he said. To date, eight species of the genus Lepidagathis and three varieties have been reported from Kerala, of which four are endemic to the Western Ghats.  Lepidagathis ananthapuramensis is closely related to Lepidagathis keralensis reported from Madayippura in Kannur district. Detailed studies have established the former as a hitherto undescribed species, he said. An erect woody herb that grows to a height of 50-100 cm, Lepidagathis ananthapuramensis is characterised by a hairy and branched stem, thick and woody rootstock, hairy leaf veins, and flowers clustered on one side of the inflorescence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-woody-herb-species-found/article32825185.ece
11 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Call for State law on minimum farm prices||The State government should bring in legislation to guarantee minimum support price to farmers for their agricultural produce, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said on Saturday. Addressing a farmers’ meet organised by the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee, Mr. Chennithala said the Opposition would move the Supreme Court against the contentious farm laws introduced by the Centre. The opening up of the sector to corporates will adversely impact food production and the future of farmers, he said. Inaugurating the meet, All India Congress Committee general secretary Tariq Anwar said the Congress would continue its struggle until the farm laws are withdrawn. The Narendra Modi government passed the Bills in Parliament without taking farmers into confidence. The Prime Minister did not discuss the Bills with farmer organisations or political parties. The Central government was solely concerned about corporate interests in this matter, Mr. Anwar alleged. In passing the farm laws, the Centre has struck at the very roots of federal principles, KPCC president Mullapally Ramachandran said. In its haste to get the Bills passed, ‘the Centre did not take Parliament into confidence or follow its procedures,’ Mr. Ramachandran said. Minimum support price would have been guaranteed to farmers if the Centre had implemented the M. S. Swaminathan committee recommendation that the MSP should be fixed at 50% more than the weighted average of the production cost, Mr. Ramachandran said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-for-state-law-on-minimum-farm-prices/article32825742.ece

11 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Showcasing students’ talents in digital form||People around the world have come up with new ideas to shake off the COVID-19 blues. With the First Bell and White Board digital classes in full swing in the State, students, including the differently abled, have taken up academic and creative activities to drive away frustration, boredom, and anxiety during this troubling period. The Thiruvananthapuram South urban resource centre (URC) under the Samagra Shiksha, Kerala, is showcasing digitally all the works created by students, including the differently abled, in the Thiruvananthapuram South educational sub-district. The ‘Digi Showcase,’ which was launched recently, targets digital education for students and teachers to overcome the challenges posed by the pandemic. The works, be it song, dance, painting, or any other activity, will be stored into separate albums for each school and class so that these can provide a lasting memory of the pandemic and its aftermath. For this, all students, parents, and teachers in the South URC will be given online training in preparing digital portfolio, digital worksheet, and digital magazine. South URC officials say while students and teachers have some idea how to shoot or click their creative works and upload them, parents rarely do. In a departure from the practice of involving only students and teachers, parents too will be roped in with the objective of realising digital literacy for all in society. The project is at present being implemented from Class I to VII. From November 20, it will be extended to the higher secondary section. A schedule too has been drawn up for Digi Showcase. For instance, to prepare digital worksheet portfolio for differently abled students, special educators will be trained first. Each educator will then prepare a portfolio for two students, and prepare worksheets as per class activities and hand them over to students. Samagra Shiksha, Kerala, Project Director A.P. Kuttykrishnan inaugurated the Digi Showcase.

Making the declaration at an online conference, he said the initial plan was to declare at least 250 local bodies as clean, based on them satisfying a set of conditions, but more than double that number had been achieved in the period. The clean status is awarded to local bodies based on a set of parameters, including mechanisms for waste treatment at source, material recovery facilities, segregated collection, and recycling of non-biodegradable waste. The Haritha Keralam Mission and the Suchitwa Mission anchored the activities. “Cleanliness is the gauge which shows the level of development in a State. Even if you attain development in all sectors and people still have to shield their noses while walking the streets, it will be a huge setback for the State’s developmental aspirations,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cm-cleanliness-is-a-development-gauge/article32825177.ece

The State police have totally failed to control the revenge murders of goonda gangs and drug mafia, he said. “It is the sixth murder over the past two weeks in the district. The police system, which should protect the life and property of people, have become a failure. The intervention of the ruling party, which does not allow the police to function freely, is the main culprit. High-level intervention is needed to bring normalcy in the district. Otherwise, antisocial elements will make life horrible in the district,” Mr. Prathapan said. Half-a-dozen murders were reported in the district in the last two weeks. This included political murder, gang wars, and even a custodial death. Action was initiated against four jail workers in connection with the death of an accused in a ganja case, who was in quarantine. Six people were arrested in connection with the murder of Sanoop, Puthussery Colony branch secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Murder of Nidhin at Muttichur was allegedly a fallout of a goonda war. Sasi, 60, of Ollur, was killed by the son of his brother and friends.

11 October 2020||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Texport workers seek Rs. 5,000 hike||On the sixth day of strike by more than 4,000 workers of three units of Texport Garments manufacturing company in the Industrial Area of Hindupur in the district, the Labour Department-initiated joint meeting of management, workers’ union and the Joint Commissioner of Labour S.Y. Srinivas, remained inconclusive after six hours on Saturday. Texport workers had been demanding hike in minimum wages (Rs. 5,000) and improvement in working conditions and have gone on strike from October 5. Mr. Srinivas, CITU State vice-president Kandharapu Murali, representing the workers, and management representatives sat for discussions from 1 p.m. and before concluding the discussions for the day, they decided to meet again on Monday to continue the process. Workers’ representatives E.S. Venkatesh (CPI-M), Imtiaz (AITUC) and others have been seeking increase in minimum wages. They pointed out that in Karnataka, which was two km away, the minimum wages were Rs. 12,000, but in Hindupur only Rs. 6,000 was being paid on an average, hence they demanded an increase of Rs. 5,000 in the wages. Replying to this demand, the management representatives seemed to have offered only Rs. 500 hike. Mr. Srinivas seems to have put forth his suggestion of the management enhancing the salary by Rs. 1,000 for all from their present levels. No decision, however, was arrived at and meeting ended in the evening to meet again on Monday. Meanwhile, the women workers continued dharna in front of the factory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/texport-workers-seek-rs-5000-hike/article32825664.ece

Diwakar Reddy’s family members, who hold the lease for Limestone quarries. The Department officials, after a thorough scrutiny of the quarries on Friday, served notices on Saturday.

11 October 2020||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Madanapalle tomatoes to reach Chennai by rail||For the first time, tomatoes of Madanapalle region, the largest tomato-growing belt in Asia, are set to reach Chennai by rail. Modalities soon The modalities pertaining to the loading, unloading and time schedules would be finalised in a couple of days in coordination with the agriculture and horticulture wings, traders and railway authorities. District Collector Narayana Bharat Gupta on Saturday announced that the first batch of the tomato stock would be transported to Chennai next week. The decision was the outcome of a series of meetings between the district administration and traders’ associations of tomato and mango products of Chittoor district and Tamil Nadu and railway authorities as well. As of now, the tomato and mango stocks, including the pulp, reach Chennai and other parts of the country from Chittoor district by road through containers. The tomatoes meant for export would be predominantly procured from Kalikiri, Gurramkonda and Madanapalle mandals, the main contributors to the Agriculture market at Madanapalle. Besides, huge stocks also reach Chennai from the Vaddepalle market in V. Kota mandal. Mr. Gupta said that regular rail transportation of tomatoes from Madanapalle to Chennai and other parts would result in further boom in the horticulture trade of Chittoor district. The traders felt that rail transportation would be beneficial to them and the risk of damage to the produce would be less compared to sending it by road. It is expected that the initial shipment would require about six bogies and the number could be more during the peak season. During the peak season, the daily arrivals of tomato stocks at the Madanapalle market alone would be about 1,200 tonnes and in the lean period, it drops to below 300 tonnes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/madanapalle-tomatoes-to-reach-chennai-by-rail/article32825666.ece

11 October 2020||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Spread confined to Tirupati, Chittoor’||The COVID-19 cases in Chittoor district crossed the 70,000-mark on Saturday, followed by over 700 casualties. In spite of the daily average of cases emerging at 800, the recovery rate at 90% has come as a breather to the officials in the district. According to the District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO), M. Penchalaiah, though the district is witnessing a high number of cases daily, it was confined to Tirupati, Chittoor municipal corporations, followed by Srikalahasti and Madanapalle municipalities. He observed that the virus spread was rapidly brought under control in the rural areas compared to the urban belt. Special medical teams “The recovery rate is close to 90% in the district in recent days, while the number of cases under institutional admission is around 4,000, and about 2,000 under home isolation. Special medical teams at the COVID hospitals are promptly attending to the emergency cases in case of their shifting from home isolation to the hospitals,” Dr. Penchalaiah said. The DMHO said that the COVID task force personnel were tracing primary and secondary contacts of the emerging positive cases, besides guiding the infected persons as to whether they should opt for institutional or home isolations. “We suggest and are ensuring that elderly patients, aged 60 or above, are admitted to hospitals. Daily, about 6,000 tests are being conducted in the district,” he said. Meanwhile, as the spread is restricted to urban areas for now, people in most of the rural belt and municipalities other than Srikalahasti are in a relaxed mood. However, social distancing, wearing of masks and hand sanitising at the business outlets has become a farcry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/spread-confined-to-tirupati-chittoor/article32824884.ece

11 October 2020||KAKINADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||TUs decry curbs on utilisation of building workers’ fund||Trade unions, led by CITU East Godavari chapter, on Saturday urged the State government to withdraw the abeyance order on the utilisation of welfare fund of the AP Building and Other Construction Workers’ Board (APBOCWW). At a round-table conference attended by the representatives of the trade unions -- AITUC, AICCTU, INTUC -- here on Saturday, a resolution was passed to intensify the protest against the abeyance order and the GO. No. 17 that directs the APBOCWW to transfer Rs. 450 crore to the State government. CITU East Godavari district general secretary Ch. Raj Kumar said that such curbs on the utilisation of the funds available with the APBOCWW would deprive the facility of claiming the benefits entitled to the registered workers. This move by the State government was violation of the existing welfare laws. The benefits include financial aid for medical treatment, wedding, risk coverage in the event of accident, natural death and disability. “The APBOCWW generates the fund by collecting workers’ cess from the builders and fee paid for registration. The fund should not be transferred to the State government as it is meant for the welfare of the registered workers,” pointed out Mr. Raj Kumar. The trade union leaders alleged that claims made by the eligible workers under various schemes of the APBOCWW to the tune of Rs. 5 crore were not settled even after over 18 months. INTUC district president T. Raju, AICCTU district president P.N. Rarasa Raju, CITU district president M. Veera Lakshmi and other trade union leaders were present. District-level meet A district-level conference will be held at NGO Home on October 20 in Kakinada, according to the leaders.

11 October 2020||NELLORE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Chennai all set to get full quota of Krishna water||Chennai can breathe easy as the Kanadleru reservoir in Nellore district, which augments the drinking water supply to the metropolis, has attained a record storage of 52.94 tmcft for the first time since the launch of the Telugu Ganga canal system in 1996. Tamil Nadu can expect to get its full quota of Krishna water this year as the storage in the reservoir is expected to go up further in the coming weeks to reach closer to its full capacity of 68.05 tmcft. “We will maintain the storage at 60 tmcft, leaving a flood cushion of about 8 tmcft, to ensure the safety of the reservoir,” Telugu Ganga project Chief Engineer C. Harinarayana Reddy said while overseeing the water release to meet the needs of, among other cities, Tirupati and Chennai. It was in the year 2010 that the reservoir had a relatively comfortable storage of 50.65 tmcft against the full capacity of 68.05 tmcft. Water realised at Poondi “The discharge from Kandaleru is being maintained at 2,650 cusecs to meet the drinking water needs of, among other cities, Tirupati and Chennai,” he told The Hindu . Two tmcft of water had already been realised at Poondi by the neighbouring State since the water release started in September. Once the farm season begins in November, the water realised from Kandaleru by Tamil Nadu will come down a bit to about 600 cusecs from the present 800 cusecs, after accounting for evaporation losses and seepage. “Going by the present trend, we are in a position to continue the water release to Chennai till March 2021,” Mr. Harinarayana Reddy indicated. The metropolis is entitled to 15 tmcft under the pact reached with the riparian states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and undivided Andhra Pradesh when actor-turned-politician N.T. Rama Rao was the Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/chennai-all-set-to-get-full-quota-of-krishna-water/article32824793.ece

11 October 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Vidya Kanuka is CM’s brainchild’||Education Minister A. Suresh on Saturday refuted the allegation that Vidya Kanuka was a Central scheme hijacked by the YSRCP government. Addressing the media here, the Minister asserted that the novel scheme was the brainchild of the Chief Minister, who was passionate about extending quality education to children belonging to all sections of society. The novelty of the scheme had attracted the attention of other States, the Minister claimed, adding that children were excited about not just their new school kits but also about the new look of their school buildings and classrooms, and were eager to attend their classes.  Central funds But unable to digest Mr. Jagan’s “growing popularity,” the Opposition leaders made baseless allegations about the programme, he said. Speaking about the Central funds, Mr. Suresh said the State had received only Rs. 100 crore from the Centre.

11 October 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||People should not panic in case of gas leak, says expert||The city experienced two domestic cylinder leaks, with one resulting in blast and the other leading to fire in kitchen on Friday night. In one case at Sabbavaram, the leak led to a blast, in which six people, including three inmates and the others who had come to their rescue, were injured, with one 45-year-old woman being said to be critical. In another leak that resulted in a fire in the kitchen at Marripalem, there were no injuries. But there was some property damage. In both the cases, the police and the Fire Department took steps to prevent further damage. But the moot question is how can there be a fire in case of a leak in domestic cylinder. According to S.P.B. Rangacharyulu, president, Fire and Security Association of India (Vizag chapter), fire can be avoided if the inmates do not panic. “A minor caution is enough,” he said. Analysing both the cases, he said, “It is clear that there was a leak from the cylinders in both the cases, but there must have been a source of fire in both the cases.” It is learnt that in the case in Sabbavaram, when gas was leaking from the cylinder, one of the injured had lit a candle. When gas leaks, a vapour cloud is formed in the area and a small spark from the friction created while closing a door or switching on the exhaust fan, is enough to cause fire. “And if the fire enters the cylinder, then there can be a blast,” said Mr. Rangacharyulu. If there is a gas leak and the cylinder cannot be turned off, move the cylinder from enclosed area to open space like terrace or balcony, where the gas can dissipate. If not possible, carefully open all windows and doors (without causing any friction) and avoid any form of ignition such as turning off or on lamps and electrical switches and immediately pour water on incense sticks if they are lighted. Keep smokers away from the spot, he said. If the smell of the gas is strong and persists, try to cordon of the area and call up the Fire Department, said Mr. Rangacharyulu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/people-should-not-panic-in-case-of-gas-leak/article32825695.ece

11 October 2020||VIZIANAGARAM/SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Sand scarcity hits construction activity||Construction industry has been hit hard both in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts due to sand scarcity. Hundreds of constructions in the two districts have come to a halt. According to sources, sand, at present, is available only in black market and a load of lorry costs around Rs. 30,000. In normal days, it costs Rs. 12, 000 to Rs. 14,000 depending on the distance of the stock point and place of construction. With sand becoming dearer, several individuals have stopped the construction activity. “Earlier, sand transport was allowed from ramps in bullock carts. The small quantity used to help individuals who were constructing their houses and shops. Now, the administration has banned it,” says a trader of Srikakulam. “Also, there is no supply of sand through online booking. We have been waiting for two months for sand. The government should look into the issue since it would have an impact on labourers also,” he adds. K.C.S. Bose, general secretary of Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India, AP chapter, has urged the government to ensure supply of sand as the construction sector is in crisis. “Thousands of labourers, electricians, welders, painters and others lost their livelihood due to delay in supply of sand. The government also loses revenue since construction industry pays direct and indirect taxes. The revenue of the Registration and Stamps Department has also come down significantly,” he points out. In fact, the government decided to give top priority to local supply. However, it is not being implemented in spite of many ramps located at many rivers including Nagavali, Vamsadhara, and Mahendratanaya. Restrictions According to sources, too many restrictions and supply through stockyards instead of ramps and other factors led to delay in supply of sand. CITU Vizianagaram district president G. Appala Suri and general secretary T.V. Ramana have alleged that more than 25,000 labourers and others lost livelihood as a result of what they called ‘wrong’ policies of the government. Meanwhile, officials attribute delay in supply of sand to its non-availability in sufficient quantities in ramps.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sand-scarcity-hits-construction-activity/article32825694.ece

11 October 2020||Bibinagar,TELANGANA||AIIMS Bibinagar to be made integrated healthcare centre||The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Telangana, located at Bibinagar in the district, will be developed into an integrated healthcare, teaching and research centre with state-of-the-art infrastructure, Minister of State (Home) G. Kishan Reddy said on Saturday. The present facility built on a 50-acre land, earlier designated by the State government for Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), would be further expanded by 150 acres to house a range of professional and patient-centric services. The State had made the land allocation recently, he said. Academic progress Mr. Reddy, who was here on a surprise visit, took stock of the hospital development, its services in the wake of COVID-19, academic progress and reviewed hospital expansion plans with officials from AIIMS and the district. 10 acres for rural health According to the plan, Mr. Reddy said 10 acres would be earmarked for rural health centre, a separate AYUSH department would be set up, and adequate staff and advanced equipment appropriate for the centre would be provided. The first academic year that began in August 2019 had 50 students for the MBBS course and 63 in the current year. Plans were afoot to admit 750 medical, 200 paramedical and 300 students in the post-graduate courses by 2021. And to accommodate students, teaching staff, and those engaged in research and innovation, modern residential amenities and facilities would be in place. Post-review, speaking to the media, Mr. Reddy said that AIIMS-Bibinagar, one of the nine apex institutes sanctioned under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana, was being developed rapidly. And his visit to AIIMS was as per instructions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He said that the district and State authorities were advised to transfer the NIMS building, in which the student affairs were being conducted now, to AIIMS. Executive director of AIIMS Vikas Bhatia and District Collector Anita Ramachandran participated in the review meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/aiims-bibinagar-to-be-integrated-health-centre/article32825581.ece
11 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||No CT-scan facility at OGH||The impending crisis with diagnostic machines has unfolded at Osmania General Hospital (OGH). From Friday night, the hospital does not have a CT-scan facility. The equipment is crucial since the scanning is important before performing surgeries on victims of road accidents with head injuries, for brain stroke patients to know if there is any internal bleeding or clots in the brain. Besides, CT-scan is used to know the probability of patients having COVID-19 if they show symptoms of the infectious disease. After rain water made its way into diagnostic rooms in the hospital’s Quli Qutb Shah block on Friday night, the CT Scan and MRI machines were shut down. “We get at least five to six such cases a day. We cannot rely on MRI machine alone as it takes around half an hour for one patient to be scanned. And road accident victims or paralysis patients need emergency care. So CT scan is preferred,” sources in the hospital said. The hospital has two CT scan machines. One in the Out Patient block, another in the Quli Qutb Shah block. The CT Scan in OP block is dysfunctional. So the hospital was left with only one of the machines. However, after rains pounded Hyderabad on Friday evening, water entered into the CT Scan machine in the diagnosis room in Quli Qutb Shah block and it was switched off. The result, no CT scan machine at the major hospital on Saturday. “Now we don’t have a CT Scan machine. If there is a patient in need of emergency care, we are forced to use X-Ray or Ultrasound machines. This situation could have been avoided if the machine in OP block was repaired on priority basis,” sources said. More pressure OGH and Gandhi Hospital are tertiary care hospitals where road accidents and other emergency cases are attended. Since only COVID-19 patients are attended at Gandhi Hospital, OGH was the only government tertiary care centre in Telangana where emergency cases are attended. With the defunct machines, a crucial process before surgeries could not be executed. It was learnt that the engineering team from Telangana State Medical Services and Infrastructure Development Corporation (TSMIDC) are taking remedial measures.  We cannot rely on MRI machine alone as it takes around half an hour for one patient to be scanned. So CT scan is preferred.

11 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Muslim bodies divided on Dharani||Muslim socio-religious organisations are divided over the non-agricultural property enrolment on Telangana State NPB, which is part of Dharani portal. Jamiat-e-Ulama Hind of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh (Mahmood Madani group) has raised concerns about data collection for the Dharani portal and called for a boycott of the non-agricultural property enrolment exercise. According to its general secretary Hafiz Khaleeq Sabir, announcements were made in several mosques across the State on Friday to ask for clarifications from those seeking property details, and in case they are unable to do so, to boycott the exercise. “We are clear about this. Why does the government want so many details, including the number of people in our houses and their Aadhaar card numbers? They already took details in the intensive household survey soon after the creation of Telangana. There was fear over NPR in the country a few months ago. Why is this exercise soon after,” he said. In a statement issued to the media, Jamiat president Maulana Hafiz Peer Shabbir said that the organisation had a membership of over 6 lakh and instructions had been given to them to seek clarifications once government officials come with the enlistment forms. “They have been told not to give information to them till clarifications come forth. Otherwise they will boycott this drive,” he said, adding that the decision to boycott TS NPB was taken once it was announced. Another cleric, Maulana Jafar Pasha, too raised similar concerns. On the other hand, the Jamiat-e-Ulama Hind of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh (Arshad Madani group) decided to support the Telangana government’s move. Speaking to The Hindu , Jamiat general secretary Mufti Mahmood Zubair said, “We believe that this is not connected to NPR and NRC. Therefore, we have decided to ask people to participate in the property enrolment. This will straighten out a lot of creases which property owners have been facing over long periods. A lot of property owners can benefit from this.” Meanwhile, the Jamat-e-Islami Hind of Telangana and Odisha is ‘studying’ the issue. Speaking to The Hindu , Jamaat president Hamed Mohammed Khan said, “We want to be thorough about what Dharani is, and also about the land laws. We are speaking to bureaucrats, former civil servants, and lawyers. We are likely to make our stand clear on Monday,” he said. In a separate development, a widely-shared video clip showed an unidentified resident turning away personnel carrying enrolment forms and wearing GHMC caps and vests. In the video, he is heard questioning the authenticity of forms which, he says, do not carry a government seal. “Why do you want Aadhaar details? You have house numbers and that is sufficient,” he is heard asking why the details of children are required. It is not clear where the incident took place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/muslim-organisations-split-on-dharani/article32825007.ece
11 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Property enumeration sluggish in Hyderabad||Enumeration of properties within the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation limits for uploading onto the Dharani portal could take much longer than expected, going by the experience so far. Despite enlisting the services of thousands of GHMC employees, the survey in the city is proceeding at tardy pace, sources informed. Going by the progress, it could take up to two months’ time for completion of the survey. Government has roped in more than 5,000 employees from the corporation’s various wings -- including Sanitation, Entomology, Town Planning, Revenue, and Engineering, for carrying out the property enumeration. Reports came in that staff of the cadres ranging from data entry operators up to assistant engineers from the head quarters too have been asked to report to the zonal offices for one week, to be part of the field survey, while higher ranking officials have been deployed to monitor the mammoth task. Despite the best of the efforts, the enumeration has been sluggish so far, and it is not yet clear if the employees would be retained on the duty for longer than a week’s time. Estimates are that there could be around 24.5 lakh properties in the city, of which only 14.5 lakh properties are on the GHMC records. Only about three lakh properties have been enumerated for the first 10 days, up to Saturday, though the employees have been made to work even on holidays. Officials say that about 7% to 8% of the enumerated properties are new, as in they have not entered the property tax records so far. Staff on the ground are facing issues ranging from suspicious property owners to technical glitches. On an average, about 30% of the employees are unable to log in due to software issues, sources informed. Besides, the kind of details sought in the prescribed format, including Aadhaar number, caste, and details of family members are giving rise to suspicion that this exercise is linked to National Population Register (NPR)/ National Register of Citizens (NRC) by the Central government. Staff roughed up “We are facing tough situation in the old city, as people are not ready to trust us. A predominant majority have refused to part with the details, and a few employees on the duty have also been roughed up,” shared an employee. The situation has only improved during the last two days, after corporators of the respective divisions have been taken into confidence to spread awareness and gain trust. All pervasive scare of COVID-19 pandemic too is proving to be a hindrance. Resident welfare associations of several apartment complexes and gated communities have barred entry for the teams due to apprehensions about spread of the disease. “Some of them, especially from gated communities, said they will upload the details online by themselves. We could convince a few, but majority of them would not budge,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/property-enumeration-moves-at-sluggish-pace-in-city/article32825562.ece
11 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Flash flood leaves behind a sandy trail||The heavy downpour on Friday that dumped 15 centimetres of rain in parts of Hyderabad also left behind tonnes of sand on the roads in its wake. Motorists, especially two-wheeler riders, had a tough time balancing their vehicles the following morning as Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation workers raced to remove the heaps of sand from the roads. At Toli Chowki, Shaikpet Nala, Jyothi Nagar, Filmnagar, Banjara Hills Road no. 10, Khairatabad, Gudimalkapur, Nampally and many other areas of the city, civic workers and contractors had to deal with piles of sand in the daytime. Areas of the city which reported water inundation on Friday evening were the worst-affected. “Kindly send your team to Toli Chowki Main Road,Meraj Colony,Galaxy Theatre,Nadeem Colony. Please also send at Ahmad Nagar Road and Habib Nagar,” Hyderabad Member of Parliament Asaduddin Owaisi tweeted on Friday evening. These areas had piles of sand after the water was drained. “This is the third vehicle we are using for moving the sand,” said a worker filling up a small cargo vehicle near Shaikpet Nala. Even after moving a large quantity of sand, the road remained dangerously slippery. Small hand tools At Khairatabad, a photo blogger captured three GHMC sanitation workers using small hand tools to push the sand into piles. “GHMC staff at work -They need better tools,” wrote Sanjay Borra on a social media platform. By evening, though the sand was removed, commuters had to deal with dry dust particles floating in air.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/flash-flood-leaves-behind-a-sandy-trail-in-the-city/article32825561.ece
11 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Buzz back on streets as citizens reclaim public spaces||It looks like business as usual near Charminar as throngs of people mill around the monument, haggle with the vendors, drink tea and click photographs of the monument. “Earlier thousands of people would come. Now, we have about 200 people visiting everyday. On October 2, we had approximately 300 people visiting the monument,” says an Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) official at the site. It is not just Charminar and its surrounding areas that make it appear as the worst of COVID pandemic is behind us. Indira Park, Lumbini Park, Necklace Road, Durgam Cheruvu park, the cable stayed bridge, malls and other public places, are seeing large number of people thronging them. The park abutting Osman Sagar lake has been closed for the past few months, but that has not stopped people from driving to the edge of the lake and inquiring about the park, according to officials at the reservoir. The crowd at Durgam Cheruvu bridge shows how citizens are trying to embrace the outdoors. The walkway on one side of the bridge is perpetually jammed through the day and even evening. “The numbers go up as it gets darker. Those nearest the bridge do more business than us,” says the owner of a tiffin centre that has popped up a month back on the stretch near the bridge. The sidewalk is now a buzzing business centre where snacks, tea and coffee vendors have appeared out of nowhere and are patronised by the visitors to the bridge. Even the Golconda Fort has seen higher footfalls from the time it reopened a few weeks back. “We used to have a few thousand visitors per day. Now, the numbers are in hundreds. On October 2 holiday, we had 1,200 visitors,” said an ASI official. Part of the reason for low number of visitors at these national sites is due to the zero-contact ticketing process. Visitors can either book online or scan the QR code at the site, pay digitally and flash the coded ticket for entry. At Chowmahalla Palace, which re-opened on October 3, the number of visitors is low. “We are getting under 100 per day in comparison to 600-1,200 visitors before the lockdown,” said a staffer at the palace.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/buzz-back-at-tourist-spots/article32825551.ece
11 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Bangladeshi woman, husband arrested for running brothel||A Bangladeshi woman and her husband, an Indian, were arrested by Uppal police on Friday, for allegedly trafficking young girls from Bangladesh and running a flesh racket. Moyna Akhtar aka Shafeeq Ul Islam (35), wife of Gunda Anjaneyulu (38) from Boduppal, is also accused of fraudulently obtaining Aadhaar card and other documents in India. A native of Narayanganj district in Bangladesh, she illegally entered India 14 years ago and married Anjaneyulu, who hails from Miryalaguda of Nalgonda district. As her earnings were not sufficient, she started luring innocent young women in Bangladesh on the pretext of a job in Hyderabad, and when they came here, forced them into prostitution. She was arrested in 2015 by Vanasthalipuram police on similar charges. Police said that the brothel was also being run by Shaila Shaik of Bangladesh, Ismathora Khatoon of Kolkata, Ruby Malakar and Indira. Currently, Shaila Shaik and Ismathora Khatoon are in the safe custody of Prajwala Home, while Ruby Malakar is at Kukatpally Home and Indira at her residence at Khairatabad. “After being released from jail in November 2017, Moyna Akhtar did not change her behaviour, and indulged in running a prostitution racket with Mohammed Afeez Ahmed,” the investigators said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bangladeshi-woman-husband-held-for-running-brothel/article32825575.ece
11 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||More eyes on the capital: govt. to step up CCTV surveillance||The sixteenth most snooped city in the world, Hyderabad is in the process of climbing up a few more notches, with the Telangana government issuing express orders to install CCTV cameras at several more locations and vantage points in the metropolis. In a recent survey conducted by a UK firm Comparitech, Hyderabad with its three lakh public CCTV cameras has bagged the dubious distinction of being the only Indian city in the top 20 most surveilled cities in the world. In fact, it is one of the two cities outside China, the other one being London. The survey mentioned in its report that little correlation was found between the number of public CCTV cameras and crime or safety aspect. Unmindful of the observation and stressing that there have been studies establishing clear, direct correlation between CCTV surveillance and reduction in crime, the government has gone ahead with its mission of installation of more such third eyes. Municipal Administration & Urban Development (MA&UD) Principal Secretary Arvind Kumar has issued the orders on Wednesday, directing GHMC and other urban local bodies (ULBs) within ORR, HMDA, HMRL, South Central Railway, TSRTC, TSIIC, HGCL, and several other departments, to install CCTV cameras at various locations. A blanket deadline of one month has been issued to all the departments for fulfilment of the orders. While it has been stipulated that the cameras should be installed only in consultation with the Police department and integrated with the existing network of the Police, the responsibility of installation, operation and maintenance rests with the respective departments only. The Town Planning wing of the GHMC, and the Directorate of Country and Town Planning (DTCP) have been asked to insert mandatory provision for installation of surveillance cameras in the building permission rules under the TS-bPASS. Accordingly, installation of the cameras will be made mandatory for all structures built in over 600 square yards of land, and all apartment complexes, shops though they are within the 600 square yards limit, besides all layouts. Instructions have been issued to bring in all the proposed Integrated Township Projects too in the ambit immediately. The exhaustive list of locations where camera surveillance has been made a norm include all notified slums, all 2BHK colonies, Basti Dawakhanas/UPHCs/government hospitals, metro rail stations and select pillars on metro routes, MMTS stations, railway stations, buses, bus depots, bus bays, bus shelters, entry points of all religious places, lakes and parks, vehicular underpasses, select locations on several roads, all IT parks, and institutional buildings within IT parks, comprehensive garbage transfer stations, all shelter homes, night shelters, orphanages, social welfare hostels, all paying guest accommodations, hostels, and educational institutions, all IALAs, petrol pumps, ORR interchanges, logistic parks, all wholesale markets, Rythu Bazars, and other retail outlets of the Marketing department, street vending zones, colony level offices of TSSPDCL, Mee Seva centres, all shop fronts, cabs run by cab aggregators, and even facades of public toilets by the road.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/more-eyes-on-the-capital-govt-to-step-up-cctv-surveillance/article32825550.ece

11 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘Exercise to overcome anti-incumbency factor’||The Congress has alleged that the Comprehensive Household Survey done in 2014 was used to map the voters and suit the interests of the ruling TRS in the last GHMC elections, and the present Dharani exercise was a similar effort. Marri Shashidhar Reddy, Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee Election Commission Coordination Committee chairman, and G Niranjan, convenor, said that the Dharani exercise would take at least a year’s time but was being condensed and the suspicion was that it was to map the voters yet again. “The TRS has failed to fulfil its promises and there is an overwhelming anti-incumbency factor which the government wants to negate utilising the data in their favour,” they alleged. “Indulgence in corruption by the corporators and MLAs and unfulfilled promises are haunting them,” they said. Mr. Reddy said the effort to bring in some amendments to the GHMC Act in the Assembly now was also an indication of it. During the monsoon session last month, the present Act was amended but election-related issues were not touched. He pointed out that the reservation of wards carried out in 2015 was fixed to suit the TRS. SC and ST and women reservations, which had to be done on the basis of the 2011 census, were faulty and done arbitrarily. “Ward-wise BC enumeration was tailored to suit TRS and so reservation done on its basis was wrong.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/exercise-to-map-voters-again-cong/article32825576.ece

It was in 2011 when notification was issued for filling 140 Group-I posts last. However, after that no notification had been issued, belying hopes of youth that formation of Telangana would bring t jobs.

In a letter to the Chief Minister, he said to impose LRS was inhumane, particularly when people were financially constrained, losing employment with the economy going down.

11 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘KCR has hidden agenda behind Assembly session’||Telangana BJP State president Bandi Sanjay on Saturday alleged that TRS government is holding one-day Assembly session to curry favour to Muslims and MIM party. In a scathing attack on TRS supremo and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhara Rao, the BJP State president said the one-day session was planned to relax the rule of not permitting persons having more than two children to contest in GHMC elections. Speaking with media persons at Kondagattu in Jagityal district, having returned from Delhi, Mr. Sanjay said the one-day Assembly session is purely to help TRS party’s ally MIM in ensuing GHMC elections by relaxing the two-child norm. He charged that Mr. Rao had already damaged the interests of lakhs of Backward Classes among Hindus by providing 12% reservations to Muslims. To exploit the Muslim vote bank in GHMC elections, Mr. Rao decided to permit persons having more than two children to contest in GHMC elections, Mr. Sanjay charged. Relaxation of two-child norm would help Muslims who have more than two children and directly benefit MIM, the BJP president alleged. Continuing the tirade against Mr. Rao, the Karimnagar MP said the TRS supremo did not utter a single word about the law brought out by the BJP against on Triple Talaq which is helping Muslim women. He would does not speak about 12% reservations for tribals but readily holds Assembly session to help Muslims, Mr. Sanjay alleged. “When KCR made sarcastic comments about Hindus during Lok Sabha elections, people taught him a lesson in Karimnagar. People would repeat it in GHMC polls if he undermines majority sections,” the BJP president said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-has-hidden-agenda-behind-assembly-session/article32825574.ece

11 October 2020||New Delhi,||Virus dampens festive cheer||The upcoming festive season will be a shadow of its usually glorious self because of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the oldest, largest and most popular Ramlilas in Delhi have been cancelled, smaller idols, restricted entry, live- streaming of rituals, slashed budgets and abandoned cultural events will culminate in muted Durga Puja celebrations across the Capital. Both renowned as much for the pomp as well as the traditional hues which draw thousands to sprawling venues each day when on display, Ramlilas and Durga Puja intersect on shashti or the sixth day of the Navratras. The Puja commences on this day and the combined festivities conclude together around Dussehra. Ramlilas are scheduled to commence on October 17 and Durga Puja on October 22. While the former will conclude with Dussehra on October 25, Durga Puja will end a day later. This October, however, both organisers and visitors are caught between the health scare due to the COVID-19 pandemic on one hand and lack of precise guidelines regarding organisational matters related to them to be issued by the Delhi government on the other. So, Ramlila and Durga Puja organisers have decided to knock on the doors of local temples with larger-than-usual compounds, banquet halls and homes with reasonable room in their surface-level stilt parking for smaller renditions of what were, till last year, larger-than-life galas. Big cancellations “Ours is the oldest Ramlila in Delhi. This will be the fourth time that it is being cancelled in our 170-year history after 1948 due to the Partition, 1962 war [with China] and 1965 war [with Pakistan]. This [COVID-19] is a global problem and even the Olympics had to be deferred,” said Rajesh Khanna, general secretary of the Shri Ramlila Committee. The SRC stages the event, which has its origins in Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar’s decision to patronise it during his reign, at the Ramlila Maidan near Delhi Gate followed by a parade of all the characters of the Ramayana through the bylanes of Old Delhi. “Given the economic condition due to the pandemic, we did not even seek donations from patrons this year. We are still in the process of figuring out what to do and will probably telecast previous episodes from our programmes,” Mr. Khanna said. Dheeraj Dhar Gupta, general secretary of the Shri Dharmic Lila, which has been organising the event at the Madhavdas Park in the Red Fort grounds since 1924, making it slightly younger than the Shri Ramlila Committee but the second oldest in the Capital, said that his committee too was mulling a similar alternative. “There seems to be no other choice than cancelling the event this year. We will exhibit episodes of the Ramayana instead,” he said. Waiting for directives While some Durga Puja committees are still waiting for government directives, most have already chalked out guidelines to be followed. The Delhi Durga Puja Samiti at Kashmere Gate, which is also the oldest in the city, will not be worshipping an idol this time — a first since 1911. The organiser, Som Prakash Mitra said, “We are literally going back a hundred years this time considering this is the first time since 1911 that instead of worshipping the idol a “ghot puja” will be done. It has only happened for the first two years since this puja’s inception in 1910.” “Even our practice of getting theatre artists and bands will be discontinued this year. Due to the current situation, we are also not forcing people for a donation. Everything will depend on the voluntary donations made by the members,” said Mr. Mitra. The Matri Mandir in Safdarjung Enclave will also be dependent on voluntary donations and online streaming of rituals this year, said committee member Debasish Saha. “While all rituals will be followed to the core there will be no idol this time. It will be a low-key affair and all rituals will be streamed online. This time, we are entirely dependent on voluntary donations and have also decided to donate the money among the needy, including the dhaakis and our regular cooks who are out of work this time,” said Mr. Saha. The little fix Ashok Goel Devraha, general secretary of the Delhi Dharmik Sangh which is an umbrella body that facilitates the organisers of Ramlilas, said traditional patrons were as certain of the fact that “something, no matter how small” needed to be organised as they were of the cap of 100 persons per religious gathering prescribed by the Ministry of Home Affairs, subject to the go-ahead of respective State governments, not being amenable to the staging of traditional celebrations. “It is more or less clear that the Ramlila will not be able to manifest itself at the usual scale; so, we will either shift the venue of the celebrations from larger ones to temple courtyards, banquet halls and even large houses with stilt parking if required,” Mr. Devraha said. “The consensus among organisers, so far, is that those who can make arrangements for small performances in such settings with volunteer actors should go ahead and do so. Gatherings revolving around the recitation of the Shri Ram Katha can be organised,” he said. Rajesh Gehlot, chief patron of the Dwarka Sri Ram Leela Society which has been a traditional crowd-puller to its venue in Sector 10 for decades and saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi in attendance last year, said a cap of 100 people on an event which used to accommodate as many as 150 artistes on stage per se and provide employment to 1,000 people in total every year was just not feasible enough to work around. “Ramlilas are not just about the stage and the performance but also the traditional mela [carnival] around them. Since the number of people permitted is even less than the artistes we are used to seeing on stage, we are thinking of organising a televised exhibition of the Ramayana at a banquet hall,” Mr. Gehlot said. Not more than 12 people The Purbanchal Bangiyo Samiti, an umbrella organisation of 38 Durga Puja samitis located across East Delhi has also decided to not allow more than 12 people at any given point during the day. “The entire day will be divided into slots which people can pre-book. In each slot not more than 10-12 people will be allowed for darshan. Even those who visit the site will not be allowed to go up to the idol. Provisions will be made in a such a way that they can view the idol from the gate. Those below 16 years and above 65 years will not be allowed,” said Mrinal Kanti Biswas, general secretary of the Samiti. Mr. Biswas added that of the 38 pujas, only 12 were having idols made this time. “On an average, each puja committee collects around Rs. 12-Rs. 15 lakh each. This time for most it has been slashed to Rs. 1-Rs. 1.5 lakh each. At the Milani Durga Puja in Mayur Vihar, whatever money is collected from our regular members will be utilised in contributing towards the weaker sections of society by distributing ration, sanitisers and masks,” said Mr. Biswas. Budgets have also been slashed at the C.R. Park Kali Mandir as opposed to previous years. While last year it collected an estimated Rs. 1 crore, this year it has been brought down to Rs. 5-Rs. 6 lakh. Stating that several crowd-control measures will also be undertaken, Prodip Ganguly, a managing committee member said, “In regular times, the daily footfall would range between 1.5-2 lakh daily. It will become very difficult to restrict some and allow others. So it has been decided that no one will be allowed. Approximately, 100 people who are directly involved with the rituals will be present within the temple premises.” “We have also decided that unlike other years, general bhog will not be distributed. It will be delivered to those who pre-book it in sanitised tiffin boxes. While all rituals will be followed and it will be live-streamed,” said Mr. Ganguly. The Arambagh Puja Samiti which usually rents a CPWD land will be relocating this year to a private hall. Shanker Chakravarty, president of the Samiti said, “Considering the fact that celebrations have been scaled down, we have decided to book a private hall. Usually, the footfall used to be around 20,000 per day, but this time the responsibility is on us. Hence we decided to impose restrictions on the number of people who can attend. Only members and their families will be allowed. The priest will be kept in isolation and no devotee will have direct contact with him.” Mr. Gehlot pointed out that while the most that visitors would confront due to the reduced scale of celebrations this year was disappointment, for innumerable others it would mean irrevocable economic hardship. Actors, idol makers affected “At least a thousand people are involved in every big Ramlila: the actors and stage artistes, those who make the three effigies, those involved in the arrangements and the ones who set up stalls for visitors. Smaller celebrations due to the pandemic will, unfortunately, mean no business for them this festive season,” he said. Nitin Chauhan, now 34, has been playing the character of Demon King Ravana since he was 18 years old. A builder, director and talent manager by profession, Mr. Chauhan jovially said he comes from “a family of Ravanas”. “My father, Santosh Chauhan has played Ravana in several Ramlilas followed by my elder brother Naveen. Having a family meal together these days ends up in disappointment and tears for us because we feel empty since we won’t be able to perform this year,” he said. “While we can do with the fact that we will not be able to get contracts for performing this year because we are economically stable, I have had to send junior artistes from my group to events all over the country so that they can make ends meet. Some of them have gone to Ayodhya to participate in small Ramlilas to get by,” Mr. Chauhan said. Idol makers, among others, are the ones critically affected by the curtailed celebrations. Gobindo Nath, a third-generation idol maker has received an order of eight idols as opposed to the 50-60 orders he received in previous years. For Niranjan Chitrokar, an annual visitor to the Capital from West Bengal, the situation has been similar. “I used to bring a team of 12-13 people three months in advance due to the number of idols we had to make. This time only my son is accompanying me. Usually the earnings we made from this season helped us survive the entire year. With the condition this bad I don’t know how we will survive,” he said.  Ours is the oldest Ramlila in Delhi. This will be the fourth time that it is being cancelled in our 170-year history after 1948 due to the Partition, 1962 war [with China] and 1965 war [with Pakistan].

11 October 2020||New Delhi,||Hindu Rao shifts 20 COVID patients to 2 govt. hospitals||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Saturday shifted 20 COVID-19 patients from its Hindu Rao Hospital to two Delhi government hospitals, said officials. Earlier in the day, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain had said that officials had been directed to shift 20 COVID-19 patients admitted at Hindu Rao Hospital to any Delhi government hospital, as doctors and staff of the municipal-run hospital have given a notice for a strike because their salaries have not being paid for many months. DDMA directives Meanwhile, the North Corporation spokesperson said that the shifting was done on directions of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), which is headed by L-G Anil Baijal, who is appointed by the Central government. The North Corporation is ruled by the BJP. “The North Corporation shifted 20 patients to Delhi Govt hospitals — 17 to Lok Nayak Hospital and three to Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital. Three COVID patients are in the ICU and we have not shifted them as they are critical,” the north body spokesperson said. “We were informed by the DDMA over the phone that there are few patients in our hospital and to shift them to Delhi government hospitals, so that Hindu Rao Hospital can provide other services,” the spokesperson said. The Delhi government PRO did not respond to queries on whether the government had issued an order to shift the patients to Delhi government hospitals. Earlier in the day, the Health Minister had said, “Hindu Rao Hospital is run by municipal corporation and doctors and staff have given notice for a strike. We have directed to shift COVID patients in the hospital to Delhi government hospital.” He added that the corporation is not paying salaries of employees, despite having funds. “The BJP is doing politics, we have told them now that if you cannot run the hospital, then give the hospital to us. There is no deficiency of funds [in corporations]. They collect a lot of money in taxes, but there is no account of where it goes,” the Minister said during the press conference. 2,866 fresh cases Meanwhile, the city reported 2,866 new COVID-19 cases in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 3,06,559, according to a health bulletin released on Saturday. The death toll has reached 5,740 following 48 more fatalities in the past 24 hours. Of the total cases, 2,78,812, people have recovered and there are now 22,007 active cases.

11 October 2020||Mumbai,||‘We need community-based mental health services’||On World Mental Health Day, Dr. Soumitra Pathare, a consultant psychiatrist and director of the Centre for Mental Health Law & Policy at Indian Law Society in Pune, speaks to The Hindu on  how society and laws discriminate against people with mental health issues and the need to stop treating them as second class citizens.  Why is it important to have a Mental Health Day? All the issues attached to mental health are a 365-day affair. But it is important to at least have an annual reminder that we need to pay attention to mental health issues. The data shows that one out of six or seven people in the world have a mental health problem or illness. So it is one day when people try to get over the stigma around it and reluctance to talk about it. It is a good day to introspect on why and how we discriminate against people with mental health issues and treat them like second class citizens. We need to ask ourselves and the governments this question and why this is allowed to continue even in 2020. Do you think over the years awareness has increased? Awareness has never been a problem. It is not like people don’t not know of mental health problems. The issue is that there is stigma and discrimination attached to mental health. As a society we very actively and freely discriminate against those who have mental health problems. How would you explain discrimination and stigma? Stigma is only an attitude and discrimination is actively behavioural. People discriminate, which has an impact on your life. What anyone thinks about you does not necessarily affect you, but how one behaves with you affects you. That is discrimination. It is active discrimination which makes people’s lives miserable.   Can you give an ex ample  of how people are discriminat ed on the basis of mental health?    Our society discriminates and our government discriminates. If you look at the laws. Our marriage laws, whether it is the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, or the Special Marriage Act, 1954, if you have a mental illness, then it is a ground for divorce. If mental illness is a health issue, then why is one health problem a ground for divorce and not one other health problem? Even HIV is not a ground for divorce. What a law like this says is if the State can discriminate then it is alright for everyone to discriminate. So that goes on to say that they are lesser human beings and they have lesser rights. There are so many cases of employment – where there is no protection from unfair dismissal if you have a health problem. What are the other laws that discriminate? There is a need to look at laws that actively and passively discriminate. There is a host of laws that definitely need to be modified. For example, in the Representation of the People Act, 1951, with respect to voting. Why should somebody with a mental health problem be denied voting? The government will say ‘mental illness’ is not mentioned in the Act and the legislation says with an ‘unsound mind’. However, electoral officers across the country have interpreted that ‘unsound mind’ means mental illness. There is a clear need to clarify that. In the Hindu marriage Act, it is very interesting that when the Act was amended and ‘leprosy’ was removed from it. We got rid of ‘epilepsy’ from the Act almost 20 years ago. However, mental illness still figures in it. Over time, leprosy and epilepsy have been deleted from the law but mental illness still figures in it. It is a discriminatory provision that needs to be removed. What steps should the government take to handle mental health issues? There is a need for more services which are acceptable to people. We need to provide community-based mental health services and not large asylums. The world over, what we have seen is that people want community-based mental health services as they are more effective and less costly. Services need to be nearer to people’s homes so that they can continue to get those services. Very few people require long-term institutional care and that needs to be provided in the community-based services. There is no use in building large hospitals with many beds if the government is not going to help people with mental health problems and recovery. How much of the government’s budget is allocated to mental health? Simple statistics show that less than 1% of the health budget goes towards mental health. While there is enough data to show that mental health issues constitute 8-10% of the health burden, we do not have enough mental health professionals.  What anyone thinks about you does not necessarily affect you, but how one behaves with you affects you. It is discrimination which makes people’s lives miserable||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/we-need-community-based-mental-health-services/article32825140.ece
11 October 2020||Mumbai,||Shrinking spaces for winged visitors a cause for concern||On World Migratory Bird Day on Saturday, experts from Mumbai came together to discuss ways to protect lesser flamingos. They said four decades ago, conditions were ideal for flamingos to visit the city but today they are being forced to feed within a tiny piece of land owing to the continuous destruction of wetlands and development activities across many areas. A webinar titled, ‘The Flight of the Pink - How can Mumbai protect the lesser flamingoes’ was organised as a part of the ‘Biodiversity by the Bay’ campaign, initiated by Ministry of Mumbai’s Magic — a citizen’s collective comprising Mumbaikars who wish to bring the issue of protecting biodiversity to the forefront. Speaking on ways to protect the iconic bird and the wetlands where they feed in Mumbai, Stalin Dayanand, Director of Projects, Vanashakti,  said, “After the loss of 2,000 hectares of wetlands for the Navi Mumbai International Airport and JNPT expansions, the habitat for flamingos and wetland birds has shrunk to 20% of what it was. The Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary is the last refuge for 1.5 lakh birds which concentrate here now. Presently, more than 60% of the habitat has been kept out of the sanctuary limits obviously to help real estate and other projects later on.” Other experts in the webinar included Bahar Dutt, award-winning environment journalist; Ashima Narain, wildlife filmmaker; Virendra Tiwari, CCF and Head of Mangrove Cell; and Ritwick Dutta from Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment. The group also discussed how wetlands at Uran used to be a flamingo hotspot, which has been reclaimed to make way for a new airport. The ongoing construction of the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link — a 22km sea bridge — cuts across mangroves and mudflats to Navi Mumbai. This means no large flocking of flamingos at Sewri bay, which lies between Thane Creek and the Arabian Sea.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/shrinking-spaces-for-winged-visitors-a-cause-for-concern/article32825138.ece

11 October 2020||Thane,||Convict serving life term held three months after jumping parole||A notorious criminal and sharpshooter, who was allegedly involved in the attack on Bollywood director Rakesh Roshan in 2000, has been arrested in Thane city of Maharashtra nearly three months after he jumped parole, a senior official said on Saturday. The accused, Sunil V. Gaikwad (52), was nabbed from Parsik Circle area in Kalwa around 9 p.m. on Friday, he said. “We had received a tip-off that Gaikwad is coming to Parsik Circle area. Accordingly, we laid a trap and caught him,” senior inspector of the Central Crime Unit Anil Honrao said. “The accused has 11 cases of murder and seven cases of attempt to murder registered against him. One of these includes attempt on Bollywood director Rakesh Roshan’s life in 2000,” Mr. Honrao said. Roshan was shot at outside his Santacruz office in Mumbai in January 2000. The assailants had fired six rounds, of which two bullets had hit Roshan, according to the police. “Gaikwad had been sentenced to life imprisonment in a murder case and was lodged at Nashik central jail. However, he came out on a 28-day parole on June 26 this year,” the official said. “He was expected to return to the jail after completion of the parole period, but he did not do so. He was hiding till his arrest last night,” Mr. Honrao added. According to the official, the accused was active during 1999 and 2000 and was involved in several crimes. He was associated with the notorious gangs of Ali Budesh and Subhash Singh Thakur. During the same period, he was also involved in a dacoity in Nashik, where he had opened fire on police personnel, he said. “Gaikwad will be handed over to the Pant Nagar police, where an offence of escape has been registered,” Mr. Honrao said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/convict-serving-life-term-held-three-months-after-jumping-parole/article32825132.ece

11 October 2020||Washington,||Trump set to get back on campaign trail||U.S. President Donald Trump made his first public appearance since returning to the White House on Monday, as he prepares a rapid return to the campaign trail just three weeks before the election. Mr. Trump spoke from the White House balcony at an event called ‘a peaceful protest for law & order,’ attended by a few hundred people standing on the lawn below. The 74-year-old President has also announced a Florida rally on Monday in an attempt to relaunch his stumbling re-election campaign against surging Democratic rival Joe Biden, who called the President’s behaviour “reckless.” Undeterred, the Trump campaign announced two more rallies next week — in battleground Pennsylvania Tuesday and in Iowa on Wednesday. Seeking to project strength and improved health, Mr. Trump had refused to participate in next week’s scheduled debate after organisers shifted it to an online format out of coronavirus concerns. On Friday, the Commission on Presidential Debates made it official, saying next Thursday’s debate is scrapped, leaving an October 22 event — the final Trump-Biden showdown — before election day on November 3. That prompted accusations of bias from Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh, who said “there is no medical reason to stop” the October 15 debate from proceeding. Knocked off the campaign trail by his three-night hospitalisation last week, the President is in the midst of a frenetic bid to catch up with Mr. Biden. On Friday, during an extended media blitz, Mr. Trump falsely claimed that COVID-19 now has a cure. He also revealed that he’d been told he was near death at the worst of his bout with the virus, which has killed more than 2,13,000 Americans and severely dented his chances of winning a second term. Crucial state On Monday, Mr. Trump will take another major step by holding a rally in a crucial battleground state. “Will be in Sanford, Florida on Monday for a very BIG RALLY!” Mr. Trump tweeted. The events come despite continued questions over how sick Mr. Trump was and how complete his recovery is now, with White House officials refusing to answer basic queries, including when the President first contracted the virus and whether he has tested negative since. After Mr. Trump spent months mocking Mr. Biden for staying at home during the pandemic, it is Mr. Biden who has barnstormed swing States this week. He visited Arizona on Thursday and campaigned on Friday in Nevada. Mr. Trump won both States in 2016. At a drive-in style event in Las Vegas, Mr. Biden slammed the President. “His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis, the destabilising effect it’s having on our government, is unconscionable,” Mr. Biden said. As Mr. Biden boarded his campaign plane, he offered a message for those attending Mr. Trump’s public events: “Good luck. I wouldn’t show up unless you had a mask and were distanced.” On Friday, Mr. Trump gave a marathon interview to right-wing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, in which he said the experimental Regeneron antibody cocktail that he took as part of therapeutic treatment was “a cure.” It’s “a total game changer.” In fact, there is no cure and still no approved vaccine for the coronavirus. Later, he appeared in his first interview since he was diagnosed with the virus, telling Fox’s Tucker Carlson show he is now “medication-free.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-set-to-get-back-on-campaign-trail/article32824782.ece
11 October 2020||MOSCOW,||Truce not holding, say Armenia and Azerbaijan||Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to a Russia-brokered ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh starting Saturday, but immediately accused each other of derailing the deal intended to end the worst outbreak of hostilities in the separatist region in more than a quarter-century. The two sides traded blame for breaking the truce that took effect at noon (0800 GMT) with new attacks, and Azerbaijan’s top diplomat said the truce never entered force. The ceasefire announcement came overnight after 10 hours of talks in Moscow, sponsored by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The deal stipulated that the ceasefire should pave the way for talks on settling the conflict. If the truce holds, it would mark a major diplomatic coup for Russia, which has a security pact with Armenia but also cultivated warm ties with Azerbaijan. But the agreement was immediately challenged by mutual claims of violations. Minutes after the truce took force, the Armenian military accused Azerbaijan of shelling the area near the town of Kapan in southeastern Armenia, killing one civilian. Azerbaijan’s Defence Ministry rejected the accusations as a “provocation.” The Azerbaijani military, in turn, accused Armenia of striking the Terter and Agdam regions of Azerbaijan with missiles and then attempting to launch offensives in the Agdere-Terter and the Fizuli-Jabrail areas. Azerbaijan’s Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov charged that “conditions for implementing the humanitarian cease-fire are currently missing” amid the continuing Armenian shelling. Armenia’s Defence Ministry denied any truce violations. The latest outburst of fighting between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces began September 27 and left hundreds of people dead in the biggest escalation of the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh since a separatist war there ended in 1994.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/truce-not-holding-say-armenia-and-azerbaijan/article32824770.ece
11 October 2020||MOSCOW,||Kyrgyzstan bans rallies, imposes curfew||Authorities in Kyrgyzstan on Saturday arrested a former President, banned rallies and imposed a curfew in the Central Asian nation’s capital, seeking to end a week of turmoil sparked by a disputed parliamentary election. The declaration of the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. curfew in Bishkek followed President Sooronbai Jeenbekov’s decree on Friday announcing a state of emergency in the city until October 21. He also ordered the military to deploy troops to the capital to enforce the measure. Convoys of military trucks were seen driving into the city. Mr. Jeenbekov has faced calls to step down from thousands of protesters who stormed government buildings a night after pro-government parties reportedly swept parliamentary seats in Sunday’s vote. The demonstrators also freed former President Almazbek Atambayev, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison in June on charges of corruption and abuse of office that hedescribed as a political vendetta by Jeenbekov. Mr. Atambayev was arrested again on Saturday on charges of organising riots, the State Security Committee said in a statement. The turmoil marks a third time in 15 years that protesters have moved to topple a government in Kyrgyzstan, a Central Asian nation of 6.5 million that is one of the poorest to emerge from the former Soviet Union. As in the uprisings that ousted Kyrgyz presidents in 2005 and 2010, the current protests have been driven by clan rivalries that play a dominant role in the country’s politics. Under pressure from protesters, the Central Election Commission has overturned the parliamentary vote results and protest leaders have moved quickly to form a new government. The President’s allies in Parliament on Saturday elected lawmaker Sadyr Zhaparov as new Prime Minister. On Friday, supporters of Mr. Zhaparov assailed pro-Atambayev demonstrators on Bishkek’s central square, hurling stones and bottles. A man with a pistol fired several shots at Mr. Atambayev’s car, but the former President was unhurt. Two other politicians affiliated with Mr. Atambayev also had their cars shot at. They weren’t injured.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/kyrgyzstan-bans-rallies-imposes-curfew/article32824775.ece
11 October 2020||BEIJING,||China protests against U.S. Navy mission in South China Sea||China said it dispatched ships and planes to track the U.S. guided-missile destroyer John S. McCain as it passed near Chinese-held islands in the South China Sea. The People’s Liberation Army accused the U.S. warship of trespassing into Chinese territorial waters on Friday near the Paracel Islands — called Xisha by China — during the latest freedom of navigation missions by the U.S. Navy aimed at defying China’s vast claims in the strategic waterway. Spokesperson for the PLA’s Southern Theater Command Colonel Zhang Nandong said Beijing demanded the U.S. end such actions, calling them “blatant navigation hegemony and military provocation” that “seriously violated China’s sovereignty and security interests, and gravely jeopardized peace and stability in the South China Sea.” “We urges the U.S. side to immediately stop such kind of provocative actions, strictly manage and control its maritime and air military operations so as not to cause any eventuality”, Mr. Zhang was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua News Agency. Counter claims China claims sovereignty over virtually the entire South China Sea, which is also claimed in whole or in part by Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam. Frictions between China and Indonesia have also increased over activities by China’s fishing vessels, the Coast Guard and Navy within Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone. China ignored a 2016 arbitration ruling that invalidated most of its claims in the South China Sea.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-protests-against-us-navy-mission-in-south-china-sea/article32824772.ece
11 October 2020||Islamabad,||Pakistan court asks Sharif to appear before it by Nov. 24||A Pakistani court through newspaper advertisements asked Nawaz Sharif to appear before it by November 24 to avoid being declared a “proclaimed offender” after the former three-time Prime Minister reportedly refused to receive non-bailable arrest warrants at his residence in London. The Islamabad High Court on Friday noted that it was left with no option but to order issuance of proclamation for intimating Mr. Sharif, 70, who has been living in London since November last year, to appear before it on November 24. A two-member bench comprising Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Aamer Farooq observed that the examination of statements of witnesses as well as the documents showed that efforts were made to serve the non-bailable warrants on Sharif to ensure his attendance before the court in the the Al-Azizia and Avenfield graft cases. Irked by the attitude of Mr. Sharif’s representatives at his residence in London, the High Court on October 7 had ordered that advertisements be issued in newspapers to summon him. The court directed the federal government to bear the cost of the advertisements in the Dawn and Jang newspapers. The government later told the court that Rs. 60,000 were paid for advertisements. The court has asked Mr. Sharif to appear before it by November 24, failing which he would be designated as a “proclaimed offender”, which may result in the confiscation of his properties as well as passport.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pakistan-court-asks-sharif-to-appear-before-it-by-nov-24/article32824777.ece
11 October 2020||ADDIS ABABA,||Israel to bring over 2,000 Ethiopian Jews||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told his Ethiopian counterpart that his country has the intention to “immediately” bring over some 2,000 Ethiopian Jews. The announcement came on Friday after a phone call with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Mr. Netanyahu’s office said the decision comes “out of his commitment to the continued aliyah of Jews to Israel”. Some 13,000 Ethiopian Jews are in the capital, Addis Ababa, and in Gondar, most of them waiting to be taken to Israel, which they call home. Most live in dire conditions and have threatened to stage a hunger strike if they’re not allowed to travel to their “homeland”. “Some 250 people have left for Israel within the past year until COVID-19 came. Now the travel has stopped, but Israeli officials are conducting interviews online,” Nigusie Alemu Eyasu, programme director for the Ethiopian Jews Community, said. Activists say Israel’s government in 2015 pledged to bring the remaining Ethiopian Jews to Israel. In 1991, while Ethiopia was in the midst of a civil war, Israel carried out the dramatic Operation Solomon, airlifting some 14,500 Ethiopian Jews in less than two days. Jews are often referred to in Ethiopia as “Falashas,” a derogatory word which translates into “strangers” or “migrants”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israel-to-bring-over-2000-ethiopian-jews/article32824773.ece

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||‘We need a scrappage policy’||Engines and power equipment supplier Cummins India is expecting full revival of business in 2022, according to its managing director Ashwath Ram . With FY20 revenue of Rs. 16,000 crore from seven entities employing 11,000 people across 20 manufacturing sites, the company has been hit hard by the pandemic. Excerpts:  How has COVID-19 affected Cummins India? All our factories were shut for the first two months of the lockdown and once the ramp-up started, we have gradually picked up and are now at roughly about 70% capacity utilisation. Demand differs across segments. Some segments such as construction or our distribution business units are doing quite well and demand is rising pretty rapidly. [But]demand from sectors like rail are badly impacted. In our power generation segment, demand from data centres, telecom, residential reality and FMCG is moving up rapidly. But segments such as commercial real estate and heavy manufacturing are reviving at a much slower rate. Overall, we are about 70% of the peak of the pre-COVID level. When do you think the auto sector, mainly HCVs, will bounce back? The heavy commercial vehicles segment has been significantly impacted because it had already slowed down due to many developments such as the NBFC crisis which happened the year before last. It triggered the slowdown and then there were many changes in regulations. The government allowed 20-25% extra loading on all vehicles already on the roads. Then we were supposed to do the BS-VI transition in April which was very expensive. It was also the fastest we had to go from BS-IV to BS-VI in three years as against 10 years in other countries. When we launched products with investments worth thousands of crores of rupees, we were already in the lockdown; so it was like a perfect storm with all variables being bad. The market for the medium and heavy commercial market is now at a 10-year low. We haven't seen such poor demand since 2008 or 2009. The demand in medium and heavy commercial vehicles is closely linked to GDP; as the economy recovers, this market will also bounce back. This market will fully revive only by 2022. But it has already started to come up, slowly. By January 2021 we will be at 50% of pre-COVID levels; now, we are at 30-40%. India and China are at logger heads. Have your exports to China been affected? No. As a matter of fact, we have had record exports to China during the last 3-4 months and there has been no impact on our business with China. We have created advantages versus China in certain products. We have the scale here as well as a cost advantage. Our labour cost is roughly 20-25% lower than China’s. So, are pricing is competitive. We are able to get entry as well as continued business from China. If relations between the two countries worsens, I don't know how that will go. But as of today, we continue to have strong exports with China. We sell them gensets, engines, manufactured components... What would you like the government to do? The government is taking a long time to introduce the scrappage policy. That would certainly help this industry because with BS-VI, the pollution levels will see 60-70% improvement over BS-IV standards. Even today we have BS-I, -II and -III vehicles running on the roads. Over 90% of the pollution is caused by these old vehicles. So, we have introduced these ultra-clean engines to the point that [exhaust from] those engines is cleaner than the Delhi air. But, it is not going to have any impact if these old pieces of equipment keep running. So, the government needs to introduce the scrappage policy immediately. Also, to boost demand, they should [waive] GST. A lot of export incentives have now been taken away and there is no clarity yet on what is going to happen from January. We're going to lose money.   A lot of export incentives have been taken away; there is no clarity yet on the road ahead.

15 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Airlines owe Rs. 2,400 crore to AAI||Several airlines have delayed payments, amounting to Rs. 2,400 crore, to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) for using airports because of losses sustained following the drop in travel demand during COVID-19. The biggest defaulter among all airlines is the Air India (AI) Group which owes more than 80% of these dues. The AAI has also declared SpiceJet and GoAir as ‘cash-and-carry airlines,’ implying they will need to pay daily rentals to be able to use the airports. As per official data, AI owed Rs. 1,887 crore, Alliance Air Rs. 97 crore and Air India Express Rs. 12.55 crore. Among the private carriers, IndiGo owed Rs. 150 crore, SpiceJet Rs. 140 crore, GoAir Rs. 58.75 crore, AirAsia India Rs. 21.61 crore and Vistara Rs. 2.79 crore. But AAI said these carriers had ensured the dues do not exceed the bank guarantees given by them. COVID-19 had also impacted AAI’s earnings from food and beverages and retaining concessionaires at its airports as they have a revenue-sharing model that has taken a hit because of the drop in passenger footfalls at airports, Arvind Singh, Chairman, AAI said recently. “The first two months of lockdown led to a revenue shortfall of 80% compared with the previous quarter. It has improved since then but hasn’t crossed the 50% mark,” Mr. Singh explained. These events have forced AAI to avail a loan of Rs. 1,500 crore from the State Bank of India for its working capital requirements and it is likely to go into the red for FY21, according to a recent statement in Parliament. AAI has been a profitable entity for several years, paying dividends to the government. In FY20, the AAI earned a profit of more than Rs. 3,600 crore from a revenue of about Rs. 14,367 crore. The AAI expects some relief from an upfront payment that Adani Enterprises is expected to make for taking over three of the six airports awarded to it for operations, management and development, by November 12.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/airlines-owe-rs-2400-crore-to-aai/article32824757.ece
11 October 2020||Chennai,||‘Centre’s, RBI’s stand in SC on loans is a big blow to MSMEs’||The Consortium of Indian Associations termed as a ‘big blow’ to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) the RBI’s affidavit in the Supreme Court pleading for vacating its stay order on the classification of NPA and the Centre ruling out further relief measures under the loan moratorium scheme. Consortium convener K.E. Raghunathan appealed to the Prime Minister to intervene and protect the interests of MSMEs. In a statement, he said, “The lockdown was implemented suddenly in national interest and it was extended for nearly six months for which MSMEs are not responsible.” He pointed out that uncertainty abounds over the next six months of business activity and that MSMEs continued to pay for fixed costs though revenue has been eluding the sector for the last six months. Earlier, the consortium had suggested several measures to the Centre. Mr. Raghunathan said an estimated Rs. 3.5 lakh crore were due to MSMEs from large industries, PSUs, SPSUs and central/State governments. These, he said, should be paid immediately. He also appealed to the Centre to waive income tax for the current year for those earning less than Rs. 15 lakh. “This will spur middle-income individuals to spend, kindling demand.” He also suggested that small enterprises with turnover of less than Rs. 5 crore be exempted from collection or levy of GST till March. “This will help them offer competitive prices. This move alone can bring down end prices by 18%.” He urged the States and the Centre to spend at least 75% of their budgeted procurements for FY21 before December 2020 to boost order books and create job opportunities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/centres-rbis-stand-in-sc-on-loans-is-a-big-blow-to-msmes/article32824760.ece
11 October 2020||kolkata,||Freight-rate surge stirs call for shipping regulator||Several trade bodies have urged the Centre to set up a regulator to deal with the rising freight charges, amid the problem of container shortages that exporters are facing. Engineering Export Promotion Council of India claimed that shipping lines are demanding high freight charges as inward traffic from different countries, particularly from China, has declined for which the exporters are required to pay a higher amount for outbound consignments. “Imports from China have fallen and the liners have increased freight rates. No shipping company likes to sail empty after delivery of export consignments,” Sanjay Budhia, chairman of CII national committee on exports and imports, told PTI. He said all the exporters across the country are facing this problem. “This is leading to a situation where cargo is lying at ports. We urged the government to set up a shipping regulator to control the freight rates,” Mr. Budhia said, adding exports have started to pick up despite the coronavirus crisis. After contracting for six months in a row, exports grew by 5.27% to $27.4 billion in September. The shipping companies have raised freight rates due to falling imports from China as liners do not have much cargo while they are returning, an official of the engineering exporters’ body said. “This is making Indian exports uncompetitive in the global markets,” an EEPC official said. After witnessing a sharp fall, engineering exports have somewhat steadied, though the contraction continues, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/freight-rate-surge-stirs-call-for-shipping-regulator/article32824761.ece
11 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Worst is over, recovery faster than expected’||Mortgage lender HDFC Ltd.’s CEO Keki Mistry on Saturday said the ‘worst is behind us’ and the economic recovery has been faster than expected. Stating that the December quarter growth could outperform the expansion logged a year ago, he said the Indian economy had shown its resilience. Benign interest rate regime will continue going forward and rates will go up only after economic activity gathers more pace and inflation pressure rises, Mr. Mistry said at an online dialogue organised by the All India Management Association (AIMA). He, however, said interest rates had bottomed out. The government should identify the job-creating sectors and address their issues on a priority, AIMA quoted him as saying.  Qualifies optimism However, Mr. Mistry qualified his optimism saying that a lot depended on whether another virus wave hits in the winter. The government was aware that India could not afford another lockdown. Job creation and leaving money in the hands of the people should be the top two priorities of the government, Mr. Mistry said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/worst-is-over-recovery-faster-than-expected/article32824763.ece
11 October 2020||Orlando,||Heat take it to Game Six||Jimmy Butler’s triple-double propelled Miami Heat to a 111-108 victory over Los Angeles Lakers on Friday. The win kept Heat alive in the best-of-seven NBA Finals, which Lakers lead 3-2. Butler scored 35 points with 12 rebounds and 11 assists and Heat withstood a 40-point performance from Lakers superstar LeBron James. Game Six is on Sunday, and seven, if needed, will be on Tuesday. Rare rally Heat can become just the second team to rally from a 3-1 deficit to win the championship series. The only other team to do it was the James-led Cleveland Cavaliers against Golden State in 2016. Butler drained two free-throws with 16.8 seconds left to put Heat up by one. James, stymied under the basket, found Danny Green for a wide-open three-pointer with 7.1 seconds remaining but Green missed and Tyler Herro added two more free-throws to seal the game. On a night that saw Heat lead much of the way, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope’s three-pointer with 6:18 remaining put the Lakers up 97-96. But Heat dug in, Duncan Robinson’s three-pointer put the team ahead 101-99 with 3:16 remaining, and it was a heavyweight slugfest the rest of the way, the lead changing hands seven more times. Robinson added 26 points for Miami. Kendrick Nunn had 14, Bam Adebayo 13, Herro 12 and Jae Crowder 11. James added 13 rebounds and seven assists for the Lakers, Anthony Davis 28 points and Caldwell-Pope 16. Multiple triple-doubles Butler is just the sixth player in NBA Finals history to have multiple triple-doubles in the title series, and just the second, along with James, to have multiple 30-point triple-doubles in the same Finals.  The result: Finals: Miami Heat 111 (Butler 35, Robinson 26) bt LA Lakers 108 (James 40, Davis 28) Lakers 3-2.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/heat-take-it-to-game-six/article32824901.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Kohli piles on the misery for CSK||It was evident in the last two games that Virat Kohli was finding his touch and he continued his good run on Saturday against Chennai Super Kings with an unbeaten 90 (4x4, 4x6) off just 52 balls at the Dubai International Stadium. The Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper came up with his best score of the tournament so far to power his side to 169 for four, rescuing the side from a slow start. Sedate start Electing to bat, RCB began sedately, with Aaron Finch falling early and Devdutt Padikal not at his fluent best. Deepak Chahar had Finch beaten with away swingers before knocking back his middle stump with a delivery that swung in. Padikkal (33) and Kohli quietly steadied things until the halfway stage as CSK stifled the batsmen on a wicket that did not appear easy for stroke-making. Then Shardul Thakur removed Padikkal and A.B. de Villiers in the same over to reduce RCB to 67 for three in the 11th over. A beauty The Indian skipper began to break free, stepping out to Thakur and hitting him down the ground before producing a beautiful cover-drive off Dwayne Bravo. With his side in trouble, Kohli hunkered down and kept the scoreboard moving with some impressive running between the wickets. He reached his half-century with a pull to square-leg boundary off Thakur. He then produced some vintage shots, going after Sam Curran in the 18th over, hitting the left-arm paceman for two sixes. The first one was over long-on and the second, an audacious flick over square-leg using his wrists to give direction while stepping down to the pacer. Dube’s cameo Shivam Dube chipped in with a cameo (22 off 14) as RCB added 74 runs in the last five overs. In the back end of the innings, CSK looked ordinary in the field with debutant N. Jagadeesan, who replaced Kedar Jadhav, dropping Dube, a sitter, on the boundary line. Despite having RCB under the mat after 15 overs, the CSK bowlers once again let the opposition off the hook and lacked discipline, sending down as many as 10 wides.  Super Kings 75 for two Super Kings were 75 for two in 13 overs with Rayudu and Jagadeesan both batting on 25. du Plessis (8) and Watson (14) were the batsmen dismissed||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kohlis-knock-propels-rcb-to-169/article32824854.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Rahul’s Kings choke and surrender||When two teams owned by Bollywood superstars clash, you know you are in for an entertaining evening. And Saturday was no different as Shah Rukh Khan witnessed some edge-of-the-seat action with his team, Kolkata Knight Riders, pulling off a narrow two-run win over the Preity Zinta co-owned Kings XI Punjab in an Indian Premier League clash. Chasing 165 at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, Kings XI seemed to be in control till the 18th over of the chase, with captain K.L. Rahul on 71 off 55 balls. Two quick wickets However, things went horribly wrong thereafter. Needing 20 off 12 balls, KXIP lost two wickets — including Rahul’s — in the space of three balls in the 19th over bowled by Prasidh Krishna. It was then seven needed off the last delivery to take the game to the Super Over, but Glenn Maxwell missed out on a six by inches. Earlier, things looked promising for Kings with openers Rahul and Mayank Agarwal forging a 115-run partnership. Rahul got a reprieve in the second over after Andre Russell dropped a chance at mid-off. Making use of the opportunity, Rahul and Agarwal (56, 39b, 6x4, 1x6) went about their business calmly. Even when Shubman Gill caught Agarwal at deep mid-wicket off Prasidh, it seemed to be too late for the Knights. But the game took a dramatic turn after Nicholas Pooran’s exit. KXIP’s decision to promote youngster Prabhsimran Singh at No. 4 — ahead of Maxwell — backfired. The youngster succumbed to pressure and managed just four runs off seven balls. Batting first, KKR struggled till the 11th over, making 63 for three. However, captain Dinesh Karthik’s counter-attacking 58 off 29 balls and opener Gill’s 57 guided the side to a competitive total. Karthik, who has been struggling, brought up his half-century off just 22 balls. And it was the 82-run stand between him and Gill that set the tone for the Knights.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kings-choke-and-surrender/article32824857.ece
11 October 2020||MUMBAI,||Pattinson happy to play supporting role||Replacing Lasith Malinga, in any outfit, is a humongous task. But James Pattinson has so far ensured defending champion Mumbai Indians has not missed the highest wicket-taker in the tournament’s history. “They’re big shoes to fill... I played my part and we have two really good white-ball bowlers in Jasprit (Bumrah) and Trent (Boult). So, just nice to play a back-seat role,” Pattinson said ahead of Sunday’s battle for the table-topper’s slot versus Delhi Capitals. The MI pace triumvirate has been the best unit in the tournament, with Bumrah picking up 11 wickets from six games and Boult 10. Pattinson is not too far behind. The best thing about MI’s bowling attack is that it can contain as well as take wickets, he said. “A team like (DC), it is sometimes really hard to stop them. They have got a wonderful batting-line up, similar to ours, it should make for a really good game,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pattinson-happy-to-play-supporting-role/article32825219.ece
11 October 2020||Abu Dhabi,||MI and DC in a battle for bragging rights||Many side-battles can be expected as the two most consistent teams — Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals — cross swords in a clash of equals on Sunday. However, experience in the pace-bowling arsenal may give MI the edge. Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult could make the difference. The good news for Capitals is Shimron Hetmyer getting his touch back. Shreyas Iyer has been impressive both as a batsman and leader. It will be interesting to see how he uses his resources against his in-form counterpart Rohit Sharma and the smashing middle-order of Hardik Pandya and Kieron Pollard. Shreyas has the exciting South African pace duo of Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje to do the job in that department. The guile of R. Ashwin further adds sting. At Dubai, Rajasthan Royals, battered and bruised, will hope Ben Stokes’ presence gets the adrenaline flowing as it seeks a revival of fortunes against a charged-up Sunrisers Hyderabad on Sunday. The Royals will be relieved to have the services of Stokes who has completed his mandatory quarantine. Jos Buttler, Smith and Sanju Samson will need to contribute in a big way. Royals’ bowling is spearheaded by pacer Jofra Archer, with support from spinners Tewatia and Shreyas Gopal. For Sunrisers, Bairstow has been in prime form this season, smashing 97 off 55 balls against KXIP. Skipper David Warner, who has scored 227 runs so far, would like to carry on with his good form. His 160-run stand with Bairstow laid the foundation for the big win against KXIP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mi-and-dc-battle-for-bragging-rights/article32824858.ece
11 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Swimming fraternity welcomes resumption of Olympic training||The Indian swimming fraternity has welcomed the decision to reopen swimming pools across the country after Sports Ministry issued the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) on Friday. Virdhawal Khade one of six Indian swimmers who has achieved the Olympic qualification B mark, and participated in the 2008 Olympics, welcomed the decision. “I hope the State governments take decision to fully support the decision taken by the centre at the soonest and 100% of the competitive swimmers can start training again,” Khade was quoted as saying in a press release. In August, SAI had sanctioned a two-month training camp in Dubai, attended by swimmers Srihari Nataraj and Kushagra Rawat, both of whom have achieved the B Qualification mark along with Sajan Prakash.  Though he had trained in Dubai, Srihari is happy to be training in India once again. Happy tidings “I’m very glad that swimming pools are opening up in India, being able to train by staying at home does make me a feel a lot better especially due to the fact I have my entire support staff available and the schedule can be designed for maximum efficiency,” said Srihari. Despite the delays brought upon by the COVID-19 pandemic, a postponed Olympics may just help Indian swimmers and Dronacharya awardee coach Nihar Ameen has said the resumption of training is a positive step in this regard. “I am very optimistic that our Olympic B qualifiers will work very hard to attain the A qualifying time and all our swimmers across the country are very enthusiastic about resuming their training,” Ameen said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/swimming-fraternity-welcomes-resumption-of-olympic-training/article32825220.ece
11 October 2020||KOZHIKODE,||Suresh was ahead of his time: Sujith||On Friday night, even as cricket fans were glued to the IPL match between Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Capitals at Sharjah, a disturbing news emerged from Alappuzha. M. Suresh Kumar, reports said, had ended his life. It was a tragic end to a remarkable cricketer, at the age of 47. The left-arm spinner was so good and a complete package that he could have represented the senior Indian team, felt those who have played with and against him. He did play for the India Under-19 team — and was the first from Kerala to do so — but had the potential to achieve more. Sujith Somasundar, former India opener and currently head of education at the National Cricket Academy, is one of those who believe Suresh could have had a brighter career. Extremely talented “I have played against him in so many matches, from the Under-15 days through the Ranji Trophy, and found him extremely talented,” Sujith told The Hindu over phone from Bengaluru. “He was a superb spinner, had a fluid action, mixed it up well and had a good loop.” He also has vivid memories of Suresh as a fielder. “He was one of the best fielders I have ever come across,” said Sujith. “I would say he was even ahead of his times when it came to fielding. He specialised in running out batsman with direct hits pretending to aim at the other end. “And he did that on the outfields of Kerala which was full of pebbles and devoid of grass.” Like Sujith, Sunil Oasis too is a contemporary of Suresh. The former Kerala captain was his teammate for over a decade. Gifted player “We have played together in junior cricket too,” said Sunil. “He was a gifted cricketer. I haven't seen many naturals like him in my career.” He said it was unfortunate that Suresh did not go on to play for the senior Indian team. “With some luck, he easily could have,” he said. “He was one of the best spinners in India at the time. Given his exceptional skills as a fielder and usefulness as a batsman, he would have excelled in ODIs.” Sunil remembers Suresh was effective on any surface but particularly difficult on turners. “I have several memories about him, including the way he ran Yuvraj Singh out in a Deodhar Trophy match in that typical fashion of his,” he said. “He was also the bowler who used to get Rahul Dravid out most when Kerala played Karnataka.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/suresh-was-ahead-of-his-time-sujith/article32825055.ece
11 October 2020||Sao Paulo,||Easy day at the office for Brazil against Bolivia||Brazil and Colombia had no trouble beating two of the weakest South American teams to score their first wins in the opening round of World Cup qualifiers. The matches took place without fans due to health protocols from the COVID-19 pandemic. Brazil easily beat Bolivia 5-0 in rainy Sao Paulo while Colombia scored all of its goals in a 3-0 victory in the first half in Barranquilla. After the first round, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay and Argentina lead with three points. Peru and Paraguay have one. Ecuador, Chile, Venezuela and Bolivia have none. All five matches in the second round will be played on Tuesday: Peru vs. Brazil, Bolivia vs. Argentina, Chile vs. Colombia, Ecuador vs. Uruguay and Venezuela vs. Paraguay. Back pain Neymar, experiencing back pain ahead of the match and who was only confirmed in the starting lineup at the last minute, had two assists. He had more trouble with the pouring rain in Sao Paulo than with Bolivia’s chaotic defenders who barely touched him during the match. Defender Marquinhos opened the scoring in the 16th minute with a header. Roberto Firmino netted the first of his two goals in the 30th minute, just pushing the ball into an empty goal after a low cross from Renan Lodi. Firmino made it 3-0 in the 49th minute, assisted by Neymar, putting the ball between the legs of goalkeeper Carlos Lampe. Then 19-year-old striker Rodrygo scored his first for the national team with a header in the 66th minute. Philippe Coutinho ended the rout in the 73rd minute with a header, also assisted by Neymar. “The team took this very seriously, we were very respectful,” said Brazil captain Casemiro. “We still need to improve teamwork. Match by match we will get it.” Brazil coach Tite said the team will continue to play aggressively. Bolivia left some of its players in La Paz, looking towards the clash against Argentina at altitude. The team is in crisis due to a political dispute involving the country’s soccer body and major teams. Serious injury The match in Barranquilla was marked by a serious left-ankle injury to Colombian defender Santiago Arias after he tackled Venezuelan striker Darwin Machis in the first few minutes. Machis was initially sent off, but video review reversed the decision after it became clear the Venezuelan had not touched Arias. Colombia showed why it is one of the favourites for one of the four direct South American berths in the Qatar 2022 World Cup in the 16th minute when Duvan Zapata calmly scored from close range after a low cross by Juan Cuadrado. Ten minutes later Johan Mojica bulldozed through the Venezuelan defence from the left and assisted Luis Muriel to add a second with a classy right-foot touch. Muriel also scored the third Colombian goal in first-half stoppage time.  The results: World Cup Qualifiers (South America): Colombia 3 (Zapata 16, Muriel 26, 45+3) bt Venezuela 0.   Brazil 5 (Marquinhos 16, Firmino 30, 49, Carrasco 66-og, Coutinho 73) bt Bolivia 0.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/easy-day-at-the-office-for-brazil-against-bolivia/article32824892.ece

It is about doing the preparation well and getting the right methods and ethics into the players.” Possession football About his coaching philosophy, Fowler said it was about being competitive and playing the right way. “We want to be competitive and play the right way and get good results. This is what football is all about. We are going to be a possession-based team.

Wolff has guided Mercedes to six consecutive constructors’ titles, but the Austrian has hinted that he is ready to move on. Rosberg believes Wolff’s uncertain future is a reason for Hamilton’s reluctance to sign a new contract. Speaking to Sky Sports F1 at the Eifel Grand Prix, he said: “I do think it matters because Lewis is very convinced that Toto is an integral part of the success of that team, which is true, because Toto absolutely is. And it’s not guaranteed that if Toto goes and there is a new leader that the stability remains. Also, if Toto goes, it could potentially have a spiralling effect.” Rosberg also suggested that Sebastian Vettel will have a good opportunity to rebuild his career and reputation at Aston Martin next year after losing confidence in a car that did not suit him at Ferrari.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/wolff-exit-may-mark-downturn-for-hamilton-feels-rosberg/article32824898.ece

They have great skill levels, but it was more about working on their mindset — how to approach a T20 game. “For Abhishek as a middle-order batsman and Shubman as an opener, you have to approach (the roles) differently.

Yuvraj had long sessions with a few young Punjab cricketers, including Shubman and Abhishek earlier this year. He monitored the duo’s fitness levels and made them sweat it out in his personal gym. According to him, time management is very important in T20s. “When I was a captain, I realised that there were times when I was not standing at the position because I was worried about the game.

On the eve of the match on Saturday, Bengaluru head coach Richard Hood sounded cautious, saying he expects nothing less than a “hard battle” from the Delhi-based side. “Right from the start, we have maintained that there are no favourites or underdogs in this tournament and Garhwal proved us right. They are a very well-drilled unit that has everyone on the pitch playing out a very clear game plan,” said Hood. Garhwal FC head coach Vikas Rawat said was appreciative of the efforts put in by FC Bengaluru United to play an expansive style of football. However, he implied that his boys will have their own plans of putting the ball in the Bengaluru net. “Bengaluru are a strong team. We have obviously read them and seen what they are capable of. I really appreciate the efforts put in by them in the first match, though the result may not have been enough for them,” said Rawat. With both the teams on the lookout for their first win, Hood felt that the upcoming match would not be one for the faint-hearted. “We both have our backs to the wall and there is no way out but to fight it out for three points,” said Hood. Missed chances Mohammedan Sporting will look to put the missed chances from the previous game behind as it takes on newcomer ARA FC in Kolkata on Sunday. Sporting head coach Yan Law stressed on the innumerable chances that his side missed in the previous match.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Loneliness, love, and literature||Trigger warning: The following article mentions suicide, and may be disturbing for some. “ Tu paagal toh nahi hai (Are you mad)?” The rag-picker said, not angrily, but then proceeded to thrash me. Solitude, a soulmate Sadness has been an integral part of my life: the sadness of losing loved ones, friends, family members. I would read of a stranger’s death and skip a meal, brood. I loved it, this being alone, being sad. I was surrounded by family and friends, all of whom loved me, yet I revelled in solitude. I don’t know when I began to love melancholy in cinema, and dreamt of being Rajesh Khanna from Anand or Guru Dutt in Kaagaz ke Phool . Why would anyone feel alone amidst so many people? It is hard to explain, but easy to understand if you are in depression — a condition I was diagnosed with only later in life, but probably had even as a boy — where you want to shut yourself off from the world and just disappear. The first time it came to the fore was when I was 12 years old. I was emotionally attached to my sister-in-law. She was a friend, sister, mother, and I drew inspiration from her. One day, she scolded me for something silly and my world seemed to have crashed. I slipped out of her home in Delhi and wandered around, looking for ways to end my sadness. Over the next few days, I contemplated suicide many times over, showing up at a spot in the city often. This one time, a rag-picker had been observing me, and that day, two strong hands pulled me back from the brink. He dragged me to the police station nearby, and I pleaded with them to let me go. They took pity on me, and did. I returned to my sister-in-law’s arms and just broke down. That was my first brush with death. I grew up with the guilt of having caused suffering to my vahini (Marathi for sister-in-law). I also grew up avoiding people, not turning up for social events, because I wanted to stay in my room. I never understood why; my family thought it was the anger that goes with teenage years. It wasn’t. Working at it As a sports journalist travelling around the world, I have walked around both strange and familiar cities alone, not wanting to communicate with people. Many have misunderstood this to mean that I call only when I want something. Playing football and cricket, and my sports writing kept me afloat, but I did not have the courage to confide in anyone that there was something wrong inside. What would they think of me? I had the best parents. They pampered me, and then I lost them in quick succession when I was 30. Much before they took leave of this world, they had come to understand what some of my friends thought were my “weird” ways. Being alone was weird. Then 15 years ago, my family doctor confirmed I was suffering from acute depression, when I repeated the suicidal episode. This time, I had my wonderful wife and son — Sunanda and Akshay — and office colleague C. Rajshekhar Rao to look after me. They hijacked me from my work, and sent me off to the mountains — 15 days of bliss. I came to terms with myself and settled into a routine, looking to make new friends, basically to convince everyone that I was normal. Only a few knew. Kadambari Murali Wade, a fellow journalist at the time, was one, and would speak to me for hours on end over the phone. Books, my saviour I looked for refuge in books and for peace by forging new friendships. In fact, I excelled at striking up conversations with strangers of all ages, mainly because they wouldn’t ask me, “ Tu paagal toh nahi hai? ” I wasn’t sure if it was written on my face, this sadness. I dreaded the mirror because it reflected a sorrowful image. I decided to fight it by immersing myself in work. My coping mechanisms also lay in writings on spirituality. The Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda became a companion and I loved it when Virat Kohli tweeted a selfie with that book a few years ago. Not that he had my mental health condition. Swami Vivekananda also became my new friend. Of course, I was ravaged time and again by painful memories of losing the people I loved, one by one — in just four years, I had lost three close friends. The realisation that I wouldn’t see them again would leave me acutely depressed. It would become worse when seeking help from friends — as grateful I am for them, at the time, I felt they all had their own worlds and could not always spare time for me. During the lockdown My low moods were becoming more frequent and damaging, and worsened after the lockdown. My diabetes and hypertension forced me to stay home for months. I began to read literature online about battling depression. I was never convinced that counselling would heal my mental state. I believed in facing it on my own. But a few online counselling workshops during this period gave me the strength to come to terms with life and my condition again. Then I got this priceless recommendation from a friend. I ordered Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression — and the Unexpected Solutions by Johann Hari and slowly accepted that depression was a condition that could be dealt with, and that the stigma attached to it should be broken — hence I am writing this. I realised that your best friends are at home: my family, and my childhood friend Ghaus Mohammad. They have all the time for you. I have learnt to smile again, thanks to them. I have acquired the courage to accept my condition and look for ways to conquer it, rather than deny it or pretend it isn’t there: a daily walk, reading a variety of literature, and writing that often gives me an escape. I have learnt to enjoy my life in the moment. To the question, ‘ Tu paagal toh nahi hai? ’ I would say, I am seeking help, not attention.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Be breast aware||With over 1,62,000 cases reported each year (according to GLOBOCAN 2018), breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women in our country. “A person dies every 10 minutes due to breast cancer. The actual numbers can be much more than this. While we cannot pinpoint a reason for developing the disease, it can be controlled to a great extent by being breast aware,” says Dr. P. Raghu Ram, director of KIMS – Ushalakshmi Centre for Breast Diseases, Hyderabad, and president of The Association of Surgeons of India. Being breast aware vs breast self-examination? Though the term is often used interchangeably, they are not the same. “Being breast aware is to become familiar with one’s breast and the changes that happen to it throughout a person’s life,” Dr. Ram explains. Women of all ages should be encouraged to touch and feel their breasts with their hands every day. This can be done anywhere and it helps to make us aware of what is normal and what is not. The point is to start as young as possible, to normalise and destigmatise it, and to make it a part of the daily routine. Breast self-examination (BSE) is the regular checking of breasts at a particular time every month. “This is now replaced by breast awareness as a standard practice,” he says. Changes to look out for  During the examination, we must look out for changes including:   Painless lump or thickening A noticeable change in size Recent retraction of the nipple Swelling under the armpit or around the collarbone Rash on or around the nipple Bloodstained spontaneous (without pressing) discharge from one or both nipples Dimpling of the skin Constant pain in any portion of the breast or armpit What if there is a change?  The changes do not always mean that it is cancerous. “Nine out of 10 breast health issues are benign. But this should not stop women from consulting a doctor,” says Dr. Ram. To know if the lump is benign or cancerous, a woman will have to go through a triple assessment. “It comprises clinical breast examination by a doctor, breast imaging (a combination of mammogram and ultrasound), and core needle biopsy (ideally guided by ultrasound),” he explains. Along with being breast aware, a woman over 40 should also ideally undergo a screening mammogram once a year or at least once in two years. Who is more prone to breast cancer?  Studies prove that prolonged exposure to the estrogen hormone is a contributing factor: “People who had their menarche at a very early age (before 11 years), those who have late menopause (after 55).” Post-menopausal obesity is also a factor as fat cells are capable of producing estrogen. Childbirth below 30 years of age and breastfeeding for two years has proven to decrease this risk. Another factor is hereditary. It is caused by an abnormality in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. However, only 5% to 10% of breast cancers are caused by this anomaly.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Should schools take lessons from corporates on wellness?||In 2020, amidst a pandemic that has left the corporate world largely working from makeshift, often ergonomically-challenged home offices, Elton Mayo has resurfaced. Mayo’s work in the first half of the twentieth century traced the link between the social side of work — to grab a ready example, the two-minute banter around the water-cooler on that hanging corridor — and organisational health. The pandemic has underlined the significance his theory holds for employee wellness. Organisations now seek to virtually recreate the social side of work. So, you have colleagues sipping coffee together, parked at Google Meet, Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Non-work activities are offered virtually to help employees keep their sanity intact. It is probably equally necessary to recreate the “social side of learning” for students, as they continue to “study from home” with some slipping further into the bog of gadget dependence. “We plan online classes in such a way that children have time to share their daily experiences, interact with their peers and also have some physical exercise. We also plan for a few classes where we all have lunch or snacks together virtually. That way children feel connected with their peers and teachers,” says Abirami .P, counselling psychologist and facilitator-and-counselor at HLC International School in Karanai, off Old Mahabalipuram Road. Communication strategy  Due to the challenges resulting from the work-from-home arrangement and from the pandemic itself, corporates encourage their leaders to practise “overcommunication” with their teams so that they can lead with greater empathy. The study-from-home arrangement obviously requires a similar communication approach from teachers. Peer-level interactions and increased points of contact with teachers are now more necessary than ever before, because challenges are steadily on the rise, states Malathi Karthiban, chief counsellor, Adarsh Student Counselling Centre, which primarily caters to students of five schools and one college in Chennai that come under the Punjab Association. (On account of COVID-19, it has extended its tele-counselling service to children and even adults outside) Malathi points out that the grown-ups in a child’s world, including teachers, should engage children in conversations that can reveal coping difficulties. “There is a world of difference between the concerns children raised at the beginning of the pandemic and now. Earlier, it would largely be academics-related. Now, emotional problems surface more frequently. Aware of COVID-19 deaths in their friends’ circles, some children fear for the safety of their family members, especially the elderly among them. There is much information about COVID-19 out there for the older children to figure out who would be at high risk for complications from the disease. Where younger children are concerned, the problem often stems from an inability to process the situation correctly. It is not unusual for us to come across little children who feel neglected because they are not allowed to step out of their room. With their inability to process the complexities of human existence, let alone the peculiarities of a pandemic, little children tend to equate ‘being quarantined’ on account of a Coronavirus infection with rejection. When a child runs a temperature, it is possible to attempt to persuade them to stay confined in a room and take rest. When the child has tested positive for the virus and is asymptomatic, they have trouble processing isolation measures,” elaborates Malathi. “In these five schools, teachers now set aside two after-school hours every day — between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. — for non-academic interactions with the children of the class they handle, via a WhatsApp group. There is scope for interaction through this group during the weekends too. Teachers are expected to encourage children to discuss their day and anxieties, if any. If there is something personal to be shared, the child would be encouraged to have a one-on-one interaction. At this time, only online intervention is possible and we try to make the most of what is possible,” explains Malathi and points out that teachers of the five schools exchange notes on what works and does not in terms of making the online classes less tiresome for the children. “One of the striking shifts in focus is that the classes now begin with compliments, claps and ice-breakers,” adds Malathi. The family on board  Another takeaway from corporates during the pandemic is how they engaged with the employee’s family, particularly in the early part of the lockdown when they kept their employees’ children engaged through online contests and educative sessions. To give two examples, Prione, which provides technology support services to SMBs, got these children to design sunglasses under a programme called ‘Parents of Prione’. Temenos, a banking software solutions provider, reportedly ran an online soft skills training programme for its employees’ children. Schools could look at organising programmes that would get the student’s family on board. “We have conducted two online programmes engaging the entire family. One was a seven-day programme on gratitude, which encouraged parents to teach their children how to be grateful for the good things in their life, by first practising gratefulness themselves. We felt a need for this programme as the pandemic had led people to take a dim view of their own lives. The families were taught to be grateful not just for the things they had, but also for the things that they lacked and also for the things in their house they no longer had any need for. This way, they were being encouraged to recycle these things by offering them to people who may need them. “The second programme was ‘Lockdown Camp’ in which we called the WhatsApp group, ‘Fun Room’ where every member of the family was being taught life skills,” says Malathi. “We have started our third programme which is a self-care programme for our teachers and it covers the physical, psychological, spiritual, financial and professional aspects of their lives.” Abirami believes that if interventions that activate peer-level interactions are engineered now, when the pandemic is over, students would struggle switching to the old in-person learning environment. In a sense, children are like astronauts on a prolonged stay in space — in this case, it is online space — who would have to make some adjustments as they start living as earthlings again. Abirami says the weaning-off should happen when they are still online. However, the process has to be gently administered. Says Abirami, “The focus should not be only on academics, but also on emotional well-being. We don’t know in what ways children would have been affected during this time.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/should-schools-take-lessons-from-corporates-on-wellness/article32825276.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||A day to remember at the police station||Around 7.30 p.m., on September 29, J. Mari, a Grade-1 police constable, was on duty at Lotus Garden in Kilpauk, and he received a call from the writer at the Kilpauk police station (G-3) asking him to report 30 minutes before the routine evening roll call at 9 p.m. A stream of possibilities raced through Mari’s mind. For, this is something he had never before been asked to do, in all of his 12 years of service. He sought to find out from a few colleagues what it was all about, but they feigned ignorance. As he stepped into the station, Mari was warmly greeted by two dozen police constables and the Station Inspector. Murugesan Kottaiswamy, Inspector (Law & Order), Kilpauk police station, shook his hands, giving him an advanced birthday wish. September 29 was his birthday and the station celebrated it the previous day. An initiative by the Greater Chennai City Police Commissioner, Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, the personnel of all wings of the Police Department, including Armed Reserve (AR), Crime, Law & Order (L&O) and Traffic, are to be given a holiday on their respective birthday. They also receive a birthday greeting card signed by the Commissioner the previous evening. “I was in tears as I had never witnessed such a gathering and a cake being cut for my birthday,” says 35-year-old Mari. Initially, the police personnel were being invited to the office of the Deputy Commissioner or the Assistant Commissioner and given the greeting card. They would cut the cake together. However, due to time constraints and to prevent overcrowding during the pandemic, the celebrations started being conducted in the respective police stations during the roll call every day now. The reason to celebrate during roll call is because all the police personnel are present at the station as they report or sign off from duty at that time. “The aim is to forge bonds between police personnel especially during these uncertain times when they have to risk their lives for the larger good,” says 53-year-old-Inspector Kottaiswamy, adding that the initiative brings a lot of cheer to the entire team. The Greater Chennai Police Commissionerate has 140 police stations divided into four zones — North, South, West and East within its 12 police districts. The department is said to be continuing its earlier practice of wishing police personnel on their birthdays, over a microphone at 8 a.m in the city. The announcer will also convey the birthday wishes from the City Police Commissioner. Now that tradition has been extended to include the cutting of a cake and granting a day’s leave for birthday and marriage anniversary celebrations.  The aim is to forge bonds between police personnel especially during these uncertain times||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-day-to-remember-at-the-police-station/article32825280.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||The lockdown food factory||Every year, 79-year-old N. Chandramouli, his seven brothers and their families don’t miss participating in the Kapaleeshwar temple car festival in Mylapore. They have been following the tradition of serving food to the poor who attend the festival. The food is cooked by their three cooks. The brothers were getting ready for the festival this year, when it was going to be held in April, and they had kept the stocks in their kitchen. And then the first lockdown came into effect in March, cancelling the temple car festival. But the lockdown restrictions did not stop them from continuing with the tradition of serving the poor. They have been providing them with free food for 156 days between April and September, on the trot. Along with the food, safety kits were also distributed. And, they still continue . “We saw many poor people struggling to manage one square meal a day, and so with some support from our friends and relatives in the city and elsewhere we mobilised funds to serve the poor in the neighbourhood during the lockdown,” says 56-year-old N. Vidyanathan, the youngest among the eight brothers. With the three cooks — Kannan, Krishnan and Kumar at their house on Mathala Narayanan Street near the Jain temple, off Kutchery Road, Mylapore — they divide the work the previous evening. While the work of buying vegetables from the Broadway market and chopping them into varying sizes are carried out by the younger brothers and their children; washing the vegetables, rice and cooking them are done by the cooks and the women in the family. The menu includes sambar rice, vada, curd rice and sweets and a 200 ml water bottle. “Many neighbours supported and helped us continue the free food distribution during the lockdown; some shared our roles and a few others shopped for vegetables at the Broadway market. Many others contributed monetarily,” says N. Pattabi, another brother. Between noon and 2 p.m every day, the brothers and their children, along with a handful of neighbours, visit key roads and intersections in Mylapore, Luz Corner, Mandavali, Santhome, Royapettah and Foreshore Estate to distribute food packets to the needy. Close to 1,200 persons including 300 frontline workers, mainly conservancy staff of the Greater Chennai Corporation were also provided with food on all days including Sundays. The brothers also gave 20,000 free safety kits which included face masks, gloves and hand sanitisers. With the easing of lockdown restrictions by the State government, the brothers have only slowed down the service, and not stopped it.  Many neighbours supported and helped us continue the free food distribution initiative during the lockdown||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/the-lockdown-food-factory/article32825283.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||A Saturday cleaning routine||For the past six Saturdays, close to 50 residents of two gated communities — The Atrium and Park View — are cleaning a Greater Chennai Corporation’s playground (Ward 181 — Zone 13 Adyar) at the intersection of Sivasunder Avenue and Kalakshetra Road in Thiruvanmiyur. In addition, they also clean the road around the park. As repeated requests to the Corporation to clean the playground were of no avail, residents have taken it upon themselves to carry out the work. “With no proper maintenance, the place has become a haven for tipplers. Every morning, we find liquor bottles, food packets, plastic covers and cigarette stubs strewn all over the park. Our colony is losing its serenity. A board hanging at the gate says visitors are not supposed to consume alcohol or smoke cigarettes inside the playground. However, tipplers don’t seem to pay any heed to it,” says M.S. Bharath, a resident of The Atrium who is leading this cleaning exercise. The volunteers are also persuading their neighbours to patronise the playground. “Only when more local residents frequent the playground and get the most of it, would deviants hesitate to use it. Earlier, we were cleaning the playground in the early hours of the morning. Now, we purposefully choose to clean the playground in the evening hours, which is from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m every Saturday so that tipplers don’t come. Anyway, they enter the playground after we leave,” says Bharath. Residents were upset when tree branches were not trimmed properly “Trees that stand inside the park have branched out onto the roads. They need to be trimmed — both the branches overlooking the road and the ones found within the park. When we informed the Corporation about this, its workers trimmed the branches jutting out and refused to trim the part of the branches of the same tree found inside the park. They said that was the job of the parks department of the Corporation and they were responsible for the ones on the road,” says Bharath. The 1.5-acre playground was earlier an open space reservation (OSR) land of The Atrium. “We were maintaining it until 2006 or 2007, after which it had to be handed over to the Greater Chennai Corporation. When the OSR land was with us we were maintaining it well. We planted trees and maintained a garden. But the play equipment was installed by the Corporation.” Earlier, in December 2015, following the floods, residents came together to clean the playground. “After that, it is only now that we have taken up such an exercise, which we plan to continue. Further, we will paint the compound walls of the park with artworks hoping passers-by will not relieve themselves on the walls,” says Bharath. He also pointed out that although the nameboard calls the OSR land a playground, it has swings, slides, and other play equipment meant for smaller children, which are all features of a park. “Either, it should be provided with facilities apt for a playground or the Greater Chennai Corporation should call it as a park,” says Bharath. In this respect, a Greater Chennai Corporation official says, “It is not advisable for residents to clean the playground due to COVID-19. Soon, we will take it up and clean the place.” Bharath also says, “Earlier, the Corporation had entrusted with us one set of keys to the park. But, now as we have cleaned the park, it has got back the keys from us. We had to clean the park because people were having food and we faced the menace of rodents.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-saturday-cleaning-routine/article32825250.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Interior roads in Kottivakkam and Palavakkam neglected||Residents of a few neighbourhoods in Kottivakkam and Palavakkam draw attention to how some roads are being allowed to detriorate through prolonged neglect. Wear and tear and lack of intervention have led the bitumen topping to come off in some roads, exposing the gravel. With these small stones having loosened up, there is the risk of motorcyclists suffering skidding accidents, residents point out. They want the Greater Chennai Corporation to take up road-relaying work in these areas on a priority basis. Seemingly high up on the list are: Raja Street at Lakshmana Perumal Nagar in Kottivakkam and Dr. Kalaignar M. Karunanidhi Beach Road in Palavakkam. According to residents, years ago, a section of Raja Street was dug up for laying metro water pipelines. Though the work got completed, the road was not relaid, they point out. In addition, at the intersection of Rani Street in Kaveri Nagar and Raja Street in Lakshmana Perumal Nagar wears a battered look, and the condition of the surface makes skidding a dangerous possibility for motorists. Navigate it. Similarly, the intersection of Fourth Cross Street and Fifth Cross Street at Lakshmana Perumal Nagar and Raja Street needs mending. “Near the intersection of Raja Street and Karthik Street at Kaveri Nagar in Kottivakkam, the road is uneven due to protruding stones. Therefore, people are using only one half of the road which makes for sluggish vehicular movement,” says G. Aishwarya, a resident of Kottivakkam. S. Bhaskaran, a resident of Palavakkam, says, “Beach Road First Cross Street and Beach Road Second Cross Street intersecting with Dr. Kalaignar M. Karunanidhi Beach Road are battered. Years ago, when the Palavakkam Beach Road was relaid with cement surface, a few damaged points on the stretch were relaid too. But now, they are in a bad shape.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/interior-roads-in-kottivakkam-and-palavakkam-neglected/article32825292.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Water tankers speed through narrow streets’||A couple of weeks ago, on Sarathy Nagar Main Road in Velachery, Arun Raj heard a dog whimpering, and discovered that it had sustained a head injury. Checking the CCTV footage to find out what had caused the canine harm led him to the moving images of a water tanker, one pressed into service on behalf of the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (CMWSSB). Arun says, “The footage showed that the driver was driving recklessly, not slowing down even at the turn of the street.” Madhusudhanan Sampath, another resident, points out that a few days ago, a parked car in one of the streets of Sarathy Nagar missed being hit by a speeding water tanker, by a whisker. CMWSSB tankers passing via the interior lanes of Sarathy Nagar is a problem that its residents have endured for many years. This March, Sarathy Nagar Residents Welfare Association made a complaint about this continuing menace to the CMWSSB Area Office and Greater Chennai Traffic Police this March. “CMWSSB officials promised that they would instruct their contractors and drivers about this. The tankers were off out streets for two weeks. By passing through Sarathy Nagar, drivers of water tankers avoid the congested Taramani-Velachery Link Road. The streets in Sarathy Nagar are however narrow, with sharp bends, and hardly meant for water tankers to pass through. Between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. every day, once in 15 minutes, a water tanker passes through Sarathy Nagar,” says Gokhul, secretary of the Association. Residents point out these tankers ride over stormwater drains and they are likely to get broken anytime. “Some of the drivers honk raucously and play loud music. When I made a complaint to a CMWSSB official, I was not prepared for the reply I received. He sympathised with the contractors and said that they take the interior lanes to save on fuel. The traffic police have promised to look into the issue, but no action has been taken so far,” says T.K. Kumaravelu, vice-president of the Association. “Slow in their reflexes, senior citizens taking a walk through the neighbourhood are in danger on account of speeding water tankers. CMWSSB should take measures to stop its vehicles from entering our neighbourhood,” says Hari Priya Ramesh, joint-secretary of the Association.  “Every day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., once in 15 minutes, a tanker passes through the colony”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/water-tankers-speed-through-narrow-streets/article32825256.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Kapaleeswarar Nagar residents go to court over SWD work||Kapaleeswarar Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association has filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court seeking a directive against the construction of stormwater drains at Kapaleeswarar Nagar in Neelankarai on East Coast Road. With repeated representations to Greater Chennai Corporation to drop its plan to construct stormwater drains failing to yield results, the Association has resorted to a legal course. The Greater Chennai Corporation and the German development bank, KfW Development Bank, have proposed to construct stormwater drains in South Chennai at a cost of Rs. 1,200 crore through East Coast Road connecting Kovalam Basin. Kapaleeswarar Nagar is among the neighbourhoods on East Coast Road that come under the purview of this project. Residents of Kapaleeswarar Nagar have opposed moves to construct stormwater drains in their locality for the following reasons. “There is a 23-feet natural downward slope from East Coast Road to the sea which allows for draining of excess flood water. The soil is sandy and hence absorbent. In our representations to GCC, we also pointed out that even during the 2004 tsunami and 2015 floods, there wasn’t waterlogging in our area. In addition, it will be against the interests of rainwater harvesting. Through stormwater drains, rainwater is allowed to go into the sea. But we want to conserve rainwater and thereby recharge the groundwater table. Hence we don’t want stormwater drains for our locality,” says Rohit Menon, secretary, Kapaleeswarar Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association. Further, the Association has pointed out that there is no site-specific drawing for Kapaleeswar Nagar and therefore contractors will construct the drains according to their convenience. “In the nearby localities where stormwater drains are constructed, sewage flows through it and pollutes the sea. Funds meant for SWD work can instead be used provide us with underground sewage drains and piped drinking water supply. We are buying water cans for cooking and drinking purposes. Besides, we spend so much towards clearing the septic tanks in our houses. As there was no reply from GCC to our requests, we decided to file a writ petition in the Madras High Court,” says Rohit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/kapaleeswarar-nagar-residents-go-to-court-over-swd-work/article32825254.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||The gates swing open||For over six months, ICF South Colony shut the door on the outside world to keep those on the inside safe. With two of its three gates kept locked at all hours, the Colony did not seek to couch its intentions in any form of ambiguity. It’s only now, after all its three gates are open for outsiders, does the insularity of the past six months come home to its residents. Spread across several acres, the housing society has around 1700 ICF employees who have taken residence there along with their families. With tree-lined streets, a spacious playground, a park and other amenities, ICF South Colony has held out for people outside the locality. And the society has always extended an attitude of welcome towards outsiders, without however compromising on the privacy and safety of its residents. Besides, there was also the question of access that had to be extended to people. Many motorists use the gates of the colony to access a shorter route to Perambur and Anna Nagar. “You skip two signals and reach 12th Main Road by going inside the colony,” says Shahul Hameed, secretary of ICF South Colony Residents Association. A. Udayappan, another committee member, points out that even in pre-COVID days, one of the entrance gates would be kept closed between 10 a.m. and noon to reduce the vehicular flow through the colony.  Precautionary measures When the lockdown began in March, as a precautionary measure against COVID-19, the resident’s welfare association decided to block access to two of its gates. However, the main entrance was kept open with two security guard regulating the movement of motorists. “We had taken various initiatives to keep residents in our quarters safe and these were undertaken after consultation with members,” says Hameed. “We did not want outsiders and vendors to hang out inside the colony, so we put these restrictions in place,” says Hameed. With various restrictions across Chennai having been eased, the Association decided to open its gates. While the main gate is open round-the-clock, the others offer restricted access to outsiders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/the-gates-swing-open/article32825270.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Shopping app goes into retirement||In keeping with the easing of lockdown restrictions by the Government, residents of a gated community in Siruseri reportedly put certain in-house restrictions to a vote. A shopping system got dismantled, and so, a free web app that promoted it had to bow out. Created by residents, the app had punctuated shopping processes at two stores on the premises, with calculated pauses to ensure contact-less trading and social distancing. Its popularity growing beyond this community, it was even adopted by another. Despite its evident usefulness, the app lost favour with the residents. Over the last seven months, best-laid plans by RWAs have come unstuck after initial success. In the end, these initiatives are not missteps, only miscalculations. Their applicability and value can’t be doubted. Only that, sometimes, their relevance was overestimated. Sometimes, inherent challenges had been glossed over. At L&T Eden Park, this web app had made it possible for residents to shop at an in-house supermarket and vegetable store, from their living rooms. From a virtual shelf, they could check items into the cart. Before the purchase rolled into the reception, the resident would be notified, thereby cutting out queues in the collection area. In terms of social distancing in a shopping space, this was just what the doctor ordered. Besides, every day, a special hour was earmarked for a pre-determined block which enabled residents of all eight blocks to buy all essentials before these ran out of stock. The creators kept finetuning the app, bunging in features to address previously unacknowledged issues. “Order till availability” was such a feature: It kept the order alive, carrying it over till the item was available at the stores and delivered to the resident. The creators also sought to address a socio-economic question by bringing small vendors — such as the tender coconut and milk vendors — into its purview. And then, reality caught up with it. Sathish Arcot, a resident of L&T Eden Park, says, “The vendors expressed their concern that the lack of shoppers’ footfall was affecting their business. Obviously, if people visited a store they would make more purchases than if they shopped from home. Besides, with government easing lockdown restrictions considerably, residents wanted an in-person shopping experience, of course with safety protocols in place. And this meant the app had to go.”  In the end, these initiatives are not missteps, only miscalculations. Their applicability and value can’t be doubted||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/shopping-app-goes-into-retirement/article32825266.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Footpaths come up on road in Besant Nagar, Kalakshetra Colony residents are unimpressed||Kalakshetra Colony Welfare Association (KCWA) cannot bring itself to give Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) a pat on the back for promptly executing a part of the footpath project on Tiger Varadachari Road in Besant Nagar. What has come up is a concrete footpath and that is not what the Association had bargained for. KCWA points out that it wanted a footpath made with paver blocks to ensure rainwater percolation. The Association’s general secretary Shanthi Krishnan says, “Only on the slopes in front of the gates of houses, a concrete surface was necessary. Besides, the slopes near the gate and on the carriageway are longer than they should be. Further, the GCC had promised to keep the Association informed when the work started. We were not informed, and the footpaths were laid overnight.” Reportedly, on July 20, the Bus Route Road Department of the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) and the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy(ITDP) convened a meeting with Kalakshetra Colony residents to discuss the objectives of the ambitious footpath project. The project is geared to the goals of promoting non-motorised modes of transportation, encouraging walking and ensuring pedestrians’ safety. An ITDP representative is said to have showed examples of safe footpaths that have been laid by GCC in other parts of Chennai, notably those on Raman Street in T. Nagar, Commander-in-Chief Road in Egmore, and Sringeri Mutt Road in Mandaveli. Shanthi points out that when residents made it clear that they wanted paver blocks to be laid to ensure rainwater percolation, GCC officials accepted the request. Saucer tiles Geetha Padmanabhan, a civic activist, says, “When we questioned the workers about the laying of concrete footpaths instead of paver blocks, they replied that the latter would sink. The inter-locking tiles footpath should be stomped in such a way that it does not sink. Besides, the GCC and ITDP officials pointed out that saucer tiles will be laid adjacent to the footpath, which we agreed to. The saucer-tiles will be laid in the area between the footpath and the carriageway. Laying of saucer tiles will ensure smooth passage of rainwater, before it reaches the recharge wells (six to seven recharge wells) on the stretch. The wells will be dug based on the contours of the surface of the carriageway and the flow of the rainwater.” The tiles will keep the curb stones in place and reduce the chances of underground cables getting exposed. Whenever a need arises for carrying out electrical cable works, the tiles can be removed, and the cable wires put in place.  “Further, the GCC had promised to keep the Association informed when the work started. We were not informed about it, and the footpaths were laid overnight.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/footpaths-come-up-on-road-in-besant-nagar-kalakshetra-colony-residents-are-unimpressed/article32825258.ece

Recently, Prince Village Phase-I, a gated community in Tondiarpet, opened its gym and play area after much deliberation among residents. Both these amenities have been out of bounds for children and adults since March. With easing of lockdown restrictions, the temporary ban stands lifted. The facilities team ensures the gym and play area are cleaned. At Aashiana Apartment in Venus Colony, Alwarpet, badminton enthusiasts have to book a slot in advance via a WhatsApp group specifically created for it. Only two players can occupy the court at any given point of time. Every two players are given a 45-minute slot, which is followed by a 30-minute ‘no play’ time that is used to carry out cleaning at the court. The court is open only for an hour in the morning and three hours in the evening, as against three and six hours, respectively, before the pandemic. CCTV cameras would be watching over players to check if they are flouting any rules, including if they have come to the court without wearing a mask. “It’s difficult to control everyone and so we need to bring strong rules for the safety of all those living in the community,” says Gopinath V., acting secretary of Prince Village Phase-I Owners’ Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/gyms-parks-open-up/article32825268.ece

The Federation is making this request because there has been quite a number of reported dengue cases from the locality. N. K. Raja, secretary, Federation of Perumbakkam Residents’ Welfare Association, says, “ During May and June, the region witnessed good rains. Days after the rains, the authorities concerned in the Perumbakkam Village Panchayat, took steps to carry out fogging across the region.” Recently, the region witnessed good rains for a couple of days. The Perumbakkam Village Panchayat did not carry out fogging across the region. The mosquitoes have bred in large numbers.” The State Health Department created an awareness programme on prevention of dengue recently in various parts of Perumbakkam. “We request the authorities concerned to carry out fogging across Perumbakkam at periodic intervals,” says N.K.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||These home chefs are cooking up a storm||Rewind to the first lockdown in March. For those who can’t cook to save their life, that phase, when domestic help stayed away, left a bad taste in their mouth. For those who loved eating out, closed restaurants were hard to digest. For those who enjoyed cooking, it was an opportunity to add to their culinary repertoire, trying out new recipes. For a rare few, it was a call to start cooking up a storm. They responded to that call and how! Aware of the challenges people were facing during the lockdown, some residents of Metrozone, a gated community in Anna Nagar with around 1200 units, increased the portions they cooked to keep the youngster stuck at home and the neighbour who did not want to sweat it out in the kitchen, well-fed. They were meeting a need and getting paid for it. With every passing day, the orders kept growing. Today, some of these ‘home chefs’ have either started their own commercial food business outside the community or are in the process of starting it. On September 27, Gee Krishna Ragothaman, an astrologer, opened Kumbakonam Iyer’s Cafe at Shanthi Colony. Two of his relatives are part of the cloud kitchen where they serve a variety of South Indian food items, the idli, dosa, vada, poha and pongal among them. “Forget starting a restaurant, I never thought I could make someone so happy with good food,” says Krishna, giving credit to Raghavendran Gopal, an expert cook and his flatmate. It started during an evening walk around our gated community. “Knowing my love for cooking and and being a fan of Udipi food, a friend, S.R. Babu, asked me if we could prepare lunch for three people. He was fed up of having the same food, day after day. That’s how we got started and soon word about our initiative spread across the towers,” says Krishna. The orders started pouring in. “During weekends, the phone seemed to ring incessantly. Such was the demand,” he says. Dessert jars to burgers Rekha Vaidhyanathan is another working woman enjoying her chef moments along with her 11-year-old daughter. “Lockdown gave me an opportunity to try out new dishes,” says Rekha, who heads marketing at her family business and recently opened Dessert Addiction. “I started with bread, which became a hit and soon extended it to selling dessert jars,” she says, adding the 'mango mania' and ‘rasmalai trifle’ were the first jar she made, her voice betraying a hint of pride at the memory. A WhatsApp group by the name ‘Metrozone Organics’ is where a majority of them found their first customers. “During the lockdown, the group widened the scope of discussions to allow posts from people selling various items. With the group gaining in girth, it had to be moved to Telegram; and now we have around 600 members,” says Rekha. Similarly, Rekha’s sister Renuka, who is also a resident of the community, has found luck selling pre-cut washed vegetables to those pressed for time. There are many such residents, some who are juggling a full-time job and their love for cooking. Twenty-eight-year-old Vishnupriya Rajarajan is another such happy chef and the challenge before her is attending to the demands of a full-time job with a start-up, and at the same time savour her growing interest and fresh discoveries in burger-making. “While working from home, cooking is a stress buster,” she says on why she got started cooking and is persisting with it. Her neighbours who tasted her burgers encouraged her to turn her hobby into a part-time vocation. “I got 15 orders for my first post which was a big moment for me,” she says. “During the weekends, the numbers shot up.” How is Vishnupriya managing the two varied and equally demanding pursuits? Most of her orders have to be met in the evening and she received help in doing so, from other members of the family. While dad cuts the vegetables, her brother, whenever he finds the time, would deliver the sold packs to homes. A launch pad All these cooks say the community has been the launch pad. “What encouraged me was the reviews and the repeat orders – a neighbour who returned from the United States compared my truffle jars to the one sold by a well-known joint in the West. And a parent with a toddler was happy to see him open the fridge on his own,” says Rekha. Between June and August, many started ordering her jars for gifting purposes. By then, Dunzo had also opened up and she started delivering her specialities to customers in Velachery and OMR. Rekha has also set up her cloud kitchen in the neighbourhood itself. “I opened it a couple of days back and have started taking order through Zomato. I would be roping women from other gated communities who will get a small percentage selling the dessert jars,” she says. Vishnupriya is also grateful to neighbours from the community for the encouragement they extended to her. “I started taking referrals from Metrozone customers, which helped me get orders from outside,” says Vishnupriya who is neck-deep in the process of starting a commercial food venture. Saieeji R., joint secretary, Metrozone Owners’ Association, says they are happy that some of them have moved out to start their own commercial venture outside the community. “The rules of the Association do not permit one to run a business from within the Society. Lockdown was a unique situation and we did not discourage them then, but now as things are normalising we want residents to not commercialise it,” says Saieeji.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/these-home-chefs-are-cooking-up-a-storm/article32825306.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Should schools take lessons from corporates on wellness?||In 2020, amidst a pandemic that has left the corporate world largely working from makeshift, often ergonomically-challenged home offices, Elton Mayo has resurfaced. Mayo’s work in the first half of the twentieth century traced the link between the social side of work — to grab a ready example, the two-minute banter around the water-cooler on that hanging corridor — and organisational health. The pandemic has underlined the significance his theory holds for employee wellness. Organisations now seek to virtually recreate the social side of work. So, you have colleagues sipping coffee together, parked at Google Meet, Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Non-work activities are offered virtually to help employees keep their sanity intact. It is probably equally necessary to recreate the “social side of learning” for students, as they continue to “study from home” with some slipping further into the bog of gadget dependence. “We plan online classes in such a way that children have time to share their daily experiences, interact with their peers and also have some physical exercise. We also plan for a few classes where we all have lunch or snacks together virtually. That way children feel connected with their peers and teachers,” says Abirami .P, counselling psychologist and facilitator-and-counselor at HLC International School in Karanai, off Old Mahabalipuram Road. Communication strategy  Due to the challenges resulting from the work-from-home arrangement and from the pandemic itself, corporates encourage their leaders to practise “overcommunication” with their teams so that they can lead with greater empathy. The study-from-home arrangement obviously requires a similar communication approach from teachers. Peer-level interactions and increased points of contact with teachers are now more necessary than ever before, because challenges are steadily on the rise, states Malathi Karthiban, chief counsellor, Adarsh Student Counselling Centre, which primarily caters to students of five schools and one college in Chennai that come under the Punjab Association. (On account of COVID-19, it has extended its tele-counselling service to children and even adults outside) Malathi points out that the grown-ups in a child’s world, including teachers, should engage children in conversations that can reveal coping difficulties. “There is a world of difference between the concerns children raised at the beginning of the pandemic and now. Earlier, it would largely be academics-related. Now, emotional problems surface more frequently. Aware of COVID-19 deaths in their friends’ circles, some children fear for the safety of their family members, especially the elderly among them. There is much information about COVID-19 out there for the older children to figure out who would be at high risk for complications from the disease. Where younger children are concerned, the problem often stems from an inability to process the situation correctly. It is not unusual for us to come across little children who feel neglected because they are not allowed to step out of their room. With their inability to process the complexities of human existence, let alone the peculiarities of a pandemic, little children tend to equate ‘being quarantined’ on account of a Coronavirus infection with rejection. When a child runs a temperature, it is possible to attempt to persuade them to stay confined in a room and take rest. When the child has tested positive for the virus and is asymptomatic, they have trouble processing isolation measures,” elaborates Malathi. “In these five schools, teachers now set aside two after-school hours every day — between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. — for non-academic interactions with the children of the class they handle, via a WhatsApp group. There is scope for interaction through this group during the weekends too. Teachers are expected to encourage children to discuss their day and anxieties, if any. If there is something personal to be shared, the child would be encouraged to have a one-on-one interaction. At this time, only online intervention is possible and we try to make the most of what is possible,” explains Malathi and points out that teachers of the five schools exchange notes on what works and does not in terms of making the online classes less tiresome for the children. “One of the striking shifts in focus is that the classes now begin with compliments, claps and ice-breakers,” adds Malathi. The family on board  Another takeaway from corporates during the pandemic is how they engaged with the employee’s family, particularly in the early part of the lockdown when they kept their employees’ children engaged through online contests and educative sessions. To give two examples, Prione, which provides technology support services to SMBs, got these children to design sunglasses under a programme called ‘Parents of Prione’. Temenos, a banking software solutions provider, reportedly ran an online soft skills training programme for its employees’ children. Schools could look at organising programmes that would get the student’s family on board. “We have conducted two online programmes engaging the entire family. One was a seven-day programme on gratitude, which encouraged parents to teach their children how to be grateful for the good things in their life, by first practising gratefulness themselves. We felt a need for this programme as the pandemic had led people to take a dim view of their own lives. The families were taught to be grateful not just for the things they had, but also for the things that they lacked and also for the things in their house they no longer had any need for. This way, they were being encouraged to recycle these things by offering them to people who may need them. “The second programme was ‘Lockdown Camp’ in which we called the WhatsApp group, ‘Fun Room’ where every member of the family was being taught life skills,” says Malathi. “We have started our third programme which is a self-care programme for our teachers and it covers the physical, psychological, spiritual, financial and professional aspects of their lives.” Abirami believes that if interventions that activate peer-level interactions are engineered now, when the pandemic is over, students would struggle switching to the old in-person learning environment. In a sense, children are like astronauts on a prolonged stay in space — in this case, it is online space — who would have to make some adjustments as they start living as earthlings again. Abirami says the weaning-off should happen when they are still online. However, the process has to be gently administered. Says Abirami, “The focus should not be only on academics, but also on emotional well-being. We don’t know in what ways children would have been affected during this time.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/should-schools-take-lessons-from-corporates-on-wellness/article32825333.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||A day to remember at the police station||Around 7.30 p.m., on September 29, J. Mari, a Grade-1 police constable, was on duty at Lotus Garden in Kilpauk, and he received a call from the writer at the Kilpauk police station (G-3) asking him to report 30 minutes before the routine evening roll call at 9 p.m. A stream of possibilities raced through Mari’s mind. For, this is something he had never before been asked to do, in all of his 12 years of service. He sought to find out from a few colleagues what it was all about, but they feigned ignorance. As he stepped into the station, Mari was warmly greeted by two dozen police constables and the Station Inspector. Murugesan Kottaiswamy, Inspector (Law & Order), Kilpauk police station, shook his hands, giving him an advanced birthday wish. September 29 was his birthday and the station celebrated it the previous day. An initiative by the Greater Chennai City Police Commissioner, Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, the personnel of all wings of the Police Department, including Armed Reserve (AR), Crime, Law & Order (L&O) and Traffic, are to be given a holiday on their respective birthday. They also receive a birthday greeting card signed by the Commissioner the previous evening. “I was in tears as I had never witnessed such a gathering and a cake being cut for my birthday,” says 35-year-old Mari. Initially, the police personnel were being invited to the office of the Deputy Commissioner or the Assistant Commissioner and given the greeting card. They would cut the cake together. However, due to time constraints and to prevent overcrowding during the pandemic, the celebrations started being conducted in the respective police stations during the roll call every day now. The reason to celebrate during roll call is because all the police personnel are present at the station as they report or sign off from duty at that time. “The aim is to forge bonds between police personnel especially during these uncertain times when they have to risk their lives for the larger good,” says 53-year-old-Inspector Kottaiswamy, adding that the initiative brings a lot of cheer to the entire team. The Greater Chennai Police Commissionerate has 140 police stations divided into four zones — North, South, West and East within its 12 police districts. The department is said to be continuing its earlier practice of wishing police personnel on their birthdays, over a microphone at 8 a.m in the city. The announcer will also convey the birthday wishes from the City Police Commissioner. Now that tradition has been extended to include the cutting of a cake and granting a day’s leave for birthday and marriage anniversary celebrations.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||A Saturday cleaning routine||For the past six Saturdays, close to 50 residents of two gated communities — The Atrium and Park View — are cleaning a Greater Chennai Corporation’s playground (Ward 181 — Zone 13 Adyar) at the intersection of Sivasunder Avenue and Kalakshetra Road in Thiruvanmiyur. In addition, they also clean the road around the park. As repeated requests to the Corporation to clean the playground were of no avail, residents have taken it upon themselves to carry out the work. “With no proper maintenance, the place has become a haven for tipplers. Every morning, we find liquor bottles, food packets, plastic covers and cigarette stubs strewn all over the park. Our colony is losing its serenity. A board hanging at the gate says visitors are not supposed to consume alcohol or smoke cigarettes inside the playground. However, tipplers don’t seem to pay any heed to it,” says M.S. Bharath, a resident of The Atrium who is leading this cleaning exercise. The volunteers are also persuading their neighbours to patronise the playground. “Only when more local residents frequent the playground and get the most of it, would deviants hesitate to use it. Earlier, we were cleaning the playground in the early hours of the morning. Now, we purposefully choose to clean the playground in the evening hours, which is from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m every Saturday so that tipplers don’t come. Anyway, they enter the playground after we leave,” says Bharath. Residents were upset when tree branches were not trimmed properly “Trees that stand inside the park have branched out onto the roads. They need to be trimmed — both the branches overlooking the road and the ones found within the park. When we informed the Corporation about this, its workers trimmed the branches jutting out and refused to trim the part of the branches of the same tree found inside the park. They said that was the job of the parks department of the Corporation and they were responsible for the ones on the road,” says Bharath. The 1.5-acre playground was earlier an open space reservation (OSR) land of The Atrium. “We were maintaining it until 2006 or 2007, after which it had to be handed over to the Greater Chennai Corporation. When the OSR land was with us we were maintaining it well. We planted trees and maintained a garden. But the play equipment was installed by the Corporation.” Earlier, in December 2015, following the floods, residents came together to clean the playground. “After that, it is only now that we have taken up such an exercise, which we plan to continue. Further, we will paint the compound walls of the park with artworks hoping passers-by will not relieve themselves on the walls,” says Bharath. He also pointed out that although the nameboard calls the OSR land a playground, it has swings, slides, and other play equipment meant for smaller children, which are all features of a park. “Either, it should be provided with facilities apt for a playground or the Greater Chennai Corporation should call it as a park,” says Bharath. In this respect, a Greater Chennai Corporation official says, “It is not advisable for residents to clean the playground due to COVID-19. Soon, we will take it up and clean the place.” Bharath also says, “Earlier, the Corporation had entrusted with us one set of keys to the park. But, now as we have cleaned the park, it has got back the keys from us. We had to clean the park because people were having food and we faced the menace of rodents.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-saturday-cleaning-routine/article32825336.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Culvert work on Surapet Main Road expedited||The State Highways Department has expedited the construction of a culvert on Surapet Main Road, near Rakki theatre complex in Ambattur. Concrete roofing work undertaken recently provides evidence of this urgency. The major monsoon-preparedness work began early this year following the widening of the existing stormwater drains. The culvert would play a crucial role in preventing inundation on that section. Officials of the State Highways Department have pointed out that the new culvert being constructed to check inundation in areas around a section of Surapet Main Road with Rakki theatre complex at one end and the Oragadam junction (not to be confused with the Oragadam industrial hub) at the other end. The new culvert will help excess rainwater in Oragadam get discharged to nearby streams that are connected to the Puzhal lake. Surapet Main Road already has six culverts in Surapet and Puzhal as these neighbourhoods are located around Puzhal lake and get flooded during monsoon. “The construction of a new culvert is a welcome measure as it will prevent inundation. However, the work should be completed before the onset of the northeast monsoon,” says K. Sarath from Ambattur. As per estimates, the new culvert, built across the road, is 60 feet long and 10 feet wide and has a depth of 10 feet. Oragadam junction is the key traffic point on the eight-kilometre-long Surapet Main Road, which connects Ambattur with Puzhal near the Central Prison. The junction is part of a short route to reach Anna Nagar and Tirumangalam from Ambattur, Mannurpet, Thirumullavoyal, J.J. Nagar and Maduravoyal. Motorists coming from interior parts of Kallikuppam, Oragadam, Ambattur, Padi, Korattur, Nolambur, Anna Nagar West pass through this junction on their way to places like Maduravoyal, Porur and Tambaram via the Chennai Bypass Road. Further, the junction provides a crucial link between the western parts of the city with the neighbouring districts including Kancheepuram and Thiruvallur via Chennai Bypass. It also connects industrial belts in Sriperumbudur in Kancheepuram with the Kolkata Highway (NH:05) via Poonamallee High (PH) Road. “The new culvert work will be completed by the end of October,” says an official of the State Highways Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/culvert-work-on-surapet-main-road-expedited/article32825313.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||For a safe drive down a busy road||A irritant that marks the drive on the stretch of Surapet Main Road between Surapet and Puzhal will soon be a thing of the past. The State Highways Department has started work on installing LED lights on the stretch. Motorists from areas like Red Hills, Padiyanallur, Puzhal, Annanoor, Thirumullavoyal, Avadi use Surapet Main Road to reach the central parts of the city via Ambattur and Anna Nagar. As the ongoing flyover work in Retteri has been adding to the traffic chaos on Jawaharlal Nehru (J.N) Main Road, especially during rush hour, motorists from the Chennai’s western outskirts find it convenient to use Surapet Main Road to reach the central parts of the city in a short time. In 2019, the State Highways Department widened the road between Puzhal and Surapet, making it a four-laner. Work on fitting street lights was pending. “Prior to the lockdown, accidents were common on this stretch. Thankfully, lights have been installed now,” points out S. Jegan, a motorist from Puzhal. As per the plan, more than 15 LED street lights would come up on the median, with every two street lights spaced 30 metres apart. Each lamp pole will be have a height of 15 feet and lectrical fittings including LED bulbs on both sides. The entire is expected to be completed in a month. Reflectors will also be installed on accident-prone spots including narrow bends near the Puzhal intersection. The stretch is also a key MTC bus route that connects extended areas of the Greater Chennai Corporation including Athipet, Ambattur, Mannurpet, Oragadam, Korattur, Padi and Nolambur with Red Hills. In 2019, culverts were constructed between Chennai Metrowater pumping station and a gas station, a distance of around 800 metres. Earlier, the 800-metres-stretch had a narrow bend with no street lights, median and reflectors. The area is also low-lying, making it prone to inundation. Motorists found it difficult to differentiate between the low-lying carriageway and the stormwater drain as both would be submerged in heavy rainwater. In the past, there have been incidents of motorists slipping into the open drain. Motorists hope that installation of LED lights will make this stretch safer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/for-a-safe-drive-down-a-busy-road/article32825315.ece

Not so much by pedestrians as by vendors. When the State Highways Department completed this work last week, sections of the pavements were occupied by vendors, with the result that pedestrians would have to get down and walk on the carriageway. “Such encroachments not only prevent pedestrians from using a facility meant for them, but also damage it,” says V. Rajagopal, president, Anna Nagar West (Phase – II) Residents Welfare Association. The 60-feet Ambattur Industrial Estate Road provides access to over two dozen streets including Vinakar Koil street, Gandhi street, Ambedkar Street and Anna Street to reach Anna Nagar, Thirumangalam, Padi, Kolathur and Poonamallee High (PH) Road via Ambattur Estate Road. The stretch connects a number of neighbourhoods, including Nolambur, Mogappair, Padi, Thirumangalam, with the busy Jawaharlal Nehru (J.N)Main Road. It was during the early months of the lockdown that the footpath was heightened by a foot to prevent inundation of the stretch as well as to ensure discharge of excess rainwater into the inlets. Boulders have also been also erected along the new footpath to check unauthorised parking of vehicles, especially two-wheelers. “Steps will be taken to prevent encroachments on the footpath,” says a State Highways Department official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/new-footpaths-inaugurated-by-vendors/article32825321.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||The lockdown food factory||Every year, 79-year-old N. Chandramouli, his seven brothers and their families don’t miss participating in the Kapaleeshwar temple car festival in Mylapore. They have been following the tradition of serving food to the poor who attend the festival. The food is cooked by their three cooks. The brothers were getting ready for the festival this year, when it was going to be held in April, and they had kept the stocks in their kitchen. And then the first lockdown came into effect in March, cancelling the temple car festival. But the lockdown restrictions did not stop them from continuing with the tradition of serving the poor. They have been providing them with free food for 156 days between April and September, on the trot. Along with the food, safety kits were also distributed. And, they still continue . “We saw many poor people struggling to manage one square meal a day, and so with some support from our friends and relatives in the city and elsewhere we mobilised funds to serve the poor in the neighbourhood during the lockdown,” says 56-year-old N. Vidyanathan, the youngest among the eight brothers. With the three cooks — Kannan, Krishnan and Kumar at their house on Mathala Narayanan Street near the Jain temple, off Kutchery Road, Mylapore — they divide the work the previous evening. While the work of buying vegetables from the Broadway market and chopping them into varying sizes are carried out by the younger brothers and their children; washing the vegetables, rice and cooking them are done by the cooks and the women in the family. The menu includes sambar rice, vada, curd rice and sweets and a 200 ml water bottle. “Many neighbours supported and helped us continue the free food distribution during the lockdown; some shared our roles and a few others shopped for vegetables at the Broadway market. Many others contributed monetarily,” says N. Pattabi, another brother. Between noon and 2 p.m every day, the brothers and their children, along with a handful of neighbours, visit key roads and intersections in Mylapore, Luz Corner, Mandavali, Santhome, Royapettah and Foreshore Estate to distribute food packets to the needy. Close to 1,200 persons including 300 frontline workers, mainly conservancy staff of the Greater Chennai Corporation were also provided with food on all days including Sundays. The brothers also gave 20,000 free safety kits which included face masks, gloves and hand sanitisers. With the easing of lockdown restrictions by the State government, the brothers have only slowed down the service, and not stopped it.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||The gates swing open||For over six months, ICF South Colony shut the door on the outside world to keep those on the inside safe. With two of its three gates kept locked at all hours, the Colony did not seek to couch its intentions in any form of ambiguity. It’s only now, after all its three gates are open for outsiders, does the insularity of the past six months come home to its residents. Spread across several acres, the housing society has around 1700 ICF employees who have taken residence there along with their families. With tree-lined streets, a spacious playground, a park and other amenities, ICF South Colony has held out for people outside the locality. And the society has always extended an attitude of welcome towards outsiders, without however compromising on the privacy and safety of its residents. Besides, there was also the question of access that had to be extended to people. Many motorists use the gates of the colony to access a shorter route to Perambur and Anna Nagar. “You skip two signals and reach 12th Main Road by going inside the colony,” says Shahul Hameed, secretary of ICF South Colony Residents Association. A. Udayappan, another committee member, points out that even in pre-COVID days, one of the entrance gates would be kept closed between 10 a.m. and noon to reduce the vehicular flow through the colony.  Precautionary measures When the lockdown began in March, as a precautionary measure against COVID-19, the resident’s welfare association decided to block access to two of its gates. However, the main entrance was kept open with two security guard regulating the movement of motorists. “We had taken various initiatives to keep residents in our quarters safe and these were undertaken after consultation with members,” says Hameed. “We did not want outsiders and vendors to hang out inside the colony, so we put these restrictions in place,” says Hameed. With various restrictions across Chennai having been eased, the Association decided to open its gates. While the main gate is open round-the-clock, the others offer restricted access to outsiders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/the-gates-swing-open/article32825332.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Shopping app goes into retirement||In keeping with the easing of lockdown restrictions by the Government, residents of a gated community in Siruseri reportedly put certain in-house restrictions to a vote. A shopping system got dismantled, and so, a free web app that promoted it had to bow out. Created by residents, the app had punctuated shopping processes at two stores on the premises, with calculated pauses to ensure contact-less trading and social distancing. Its popularity growing beyond this community, it was even adopted by another. Despite its evident usefulness, the app lost favour with the residents. Over the last seven months, best-laid plans by RWAs have come unstuck after initial success. In the end, these initiatives are not missteps, only miscalculations. Their applicability and value can’t be doubted. Only that, sometimes, their relevance was overestimated. Sometimes, inherent challenges had been glossed over. At L&T Eden Park, this web app had made it possible for residents to shop at an in-house supermarket and vegetable store, from their living rooms. From a virtual shelf, they could check items into the cart. Before the purchase rolled into the reception, the resident would be notified, thereby cutting out queues in the collection area. In terms of social distancing in a shopping space, this was just what the doctor ordered. Besides, every day, a special hour was earmarked for a pre-determined block which enabled residents of all eight blocks to buy all essentials before these ran out of stock. The creators kept finetuning the app, bunging in features to address previously unacknowledged issues. “Order till availability” was such a feature: It kept the order alive, carrying it over till the item was available at the stores and delivered to the resident. The creators also sought to address a socio-economic question by bringing small vendors — such as the tender coconut and milk vendors — into its purview. And then, reality caught up with it. Sathish Arcot, a resident of L&T Eden Park, says, “The vendors expressed their concern that the lack of shoppers’ footfall was affecting their business. Obviously, if people visited a store they would make more purchases than if they shopped from home. Besides, with government easing lockdown restrictions considerably, residents wanted an in-person shopping experience, of course with safety protocols in place. And this meant the app had to go.”  In the end, these initiatives are not missteps, only miscalculations. Their applicability and value can’t be doubted||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/shopping-app-goes-into-retirement/article32825328.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Barricades come up on Link Road in Poonamallee to check accidents||New steel barricades with reflectors have been installed at key intersections on Link Road in Poonamallee to prevent accidents. The local traffic police has come up with this safety measure because many people were driving at a reckless speed as the carriageway is wide. The one-km-long Link Road has been widened and provided with a tiled footpath. Further, except for the intersections of streets with Link Road, the stormwater drain work has also been completed. The stretch also has a concrete median. However, residents want installation of street lights at the earliest because accidents occur frequently at the intersections of newly-formed streets with Link Road. “Street lights have to be installed because stray animals run across the road and motorists are often caught unawares,” says B. Vasanth, a resident of Poonamallee. The Poonamallee Municipality has to erect lamp posts on the concrete median. However, the installation of street lights is getting delayed purportedly due to funds crunch. In this respect, a police personnel says, “We are following it up with the Poonamallee Municipality and the State Highways Department. However, steps have been taken to mark zebra-crossings on the intersections of the Link Road and the streets. Unauthorised parking of vehicles on both sides of the stretch, especially at night are being curbed to prevent anti-social activities. Further, a police patrol team has been deployed at the intersection of Link Road and Poonamallee High Road.” Multi-storey apartment complexes, commercial establishments and a hospital are located along Link Road. As it is off Poonamallee High Road, many use it to reach Porur, St. Thomas Mount, Guindy and Adyar rather than taking other congested roads. Most of the residents of Link Road work in the factories at Irungattukottai and Sriperumbudur. Besides, a good number of them are employed at DLF IT Park in Ramapuram, around six km from Link Road in Poonamallee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/barricades-come-up-on-link-road-in-poonamallee-to-check-accidents/article32825340.ece

Recently, Prince Village Phase-I, a gated community in Tondiarpet, opened its gym and play area after much deliberation among residents. Both these amenities have been out of bounds for children and adults since March. With easing of lockdown restrictions, the temporary ban stands lifted. The facilities team ensures the gym and play area are cleaned. At Aashiana Apartment in Venus Colony, Alwarpet, badminton enthusiasts have to book a slot in advance via a WhatsApp group specifically created for it. Only two players can occupy the court at any given point of time. Every two players are given a 45-minute slot, which is followed by a 30-minute ‘no play’ time that is used to carry out cleaning at the court. The court is open only for an hour in the morning and three hours in the evening, as against three and six hours, respectively, before the pandemic. CCTV cameras would be watching over players to check if they are flouting any rules, including if they have come to the court without wearing a mask. “It’s difficult to control everyone and so we need to bring strong rules for the safety of all those living in the community,” says Gopinath V., acting secretary of Prince Village Phase-I Owners’ Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/gyms-parks-open-up/article32825329.ece

Madipakkam North East Residents’ Welfare Association (MANERWA) is promoting and reinforcing this message through banners that it has put up at various parts of Madipakkam North East. These banners, which offer a pictorial presentation of measures to be taken to prevent COVID-19, target spaces likely to stay busy through the day — shops and Public Distribution System (PDS) outlets are two of them. “We want our residents to be extremely careful and follow all preventive measures and protect themselves from the novel Coronavirus as lockdown restrictions have been relaxed,” says C. P. Ramanujam, additional general secretary, MANERWA. The pictorial messages on the banners urge residents to wash their hands with soap at regular intervals, wear a mask, maintaining physical distancing, and do not step out of the house unnecessarily. M. Anbalagan, president, MANERWA, says, “The banners have been put up at Sadasivam Nagar, Ram Nagar (South), and Rajaji Nagar. Also, pamphlets on COVID -19 are being distributed from door to door. When the monsoon sets in, other seasonal infectious diseases will crop up.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||These home chefs are cooking up a storm||Rewind to the first lockdown in March. For those who can’t cook to save their life, that phase, when domestic help stayed away, left a bad taste in their mouth. For those who loved eating out, closed restaurants were hard to digest. For those who enjoyed cooking, it was an opportunity to add to their culinary repertoire, trying out new recipes. For a rare few, it was a call to start cooking up a storm. They responded to that call and how! Aware of the challenges people were facing during the lockdown, some residents of Metrozone, a gated community in Anna Nagar with around 1200 units, increased the portions they cooked to keep the youngster stuck at home and the neighbour who did not want to sweat it out in the kitchen, well-fed. They were meeting a need and getting paid for it. With every passing day, the orders kept growing. Today, some of these ‘home chefs’ have either started their own commercial food business outside the community or are in the process of starting it. On September 27, Gee Krishna Ragothaman, an astrologer, opened Kumbakonam Iyer’s Cafe at Shanthi Colony. Two of his relatives are part of the cloud kitchen where they serve a variety of South Indian food items: of course, the idli, dosa, vada, poha and pongal among them. “Forget starting a restaurant, I never thought I could make someone so happy by offering them good food,” says Krishna, giving credit to Raghavendran Gopal, an expert cook and his flatmate. The beginning of this initiative is traced back to an evening walk around our gated community. “Knowing my love for cooking and being a fan of Udipi food, a friend, S.R. Babu, asked me if we could prepare lunch for three people. He was fed up of having the same food, day after day. That’s how we got started and soon word about our initiative spread across the towers,” says Krishna. The orders started pouring in. “During weekends, the phone seemed to ring incessantly. Such was the demand,” he says. Dessert jars to burgers Rekha Vaidhyanathan is another working woman enjoying her chef moments along with her 11-year-old daughter. “Lockdown gave me an opportunity to try out new dishes,” says Rekha, who heads marketing at her family business and recently opened Dessert Addiction. “I started with bread, which became a hit and soon extended it to selling dessert jars,” she says, adding the 'mango mania' and ‘rasmalai trifle’ were the first jar she made, her voice betraying a hint of pride at the memory. A WhatsApp group by the name ‘Metrozone Organics’ is where a majority of them found their first customers. “During the lockdown, the group widened the scope of discussions to allow posts from people selling various items. With the group gaining in girth, it had to be moved to Telegram; and now we have around 600 members,” says Rekha. Similarly, Rekha’s sister Renuka, who is also a resident of the community, has found luck selling pre-cut washed vegetables to those pressed for time. There are many such residents, some who are juggling a full-time job and their love for cooking. Twenty-eight-year-old Vishnupriya Rajarajan is another such happy chef and the challenge before her is attending to the demands of a full-time job with a start-up, and at the same time savour her growing interest and fresh discoveries in burger-making. “While working from home, cooking is a stress buster,” she says on why she got started cooking and is persisting with it. Her neighbours who tasted her burgers encouraged her to turn her hobby into a part-time vocation. “I got 15 orders for my first post which was a big moment for me,” she says. “During the weekends, the numbers shot up.” How is Vishnupriya managing the two varied and equally demanding pursuits? Most of her orders have to be met in the evening and she received help in doing so, from other members of the family. While dad cuts the vegetables, her brother, whenever he finds the time, would deliver the sold packs to homes. A launch pad All these cooks say the community has been the launch pad. “What encouraged me was the reviews and the repeat orders – a neighbour who returned from the United States compared my truffle jars to the one sold by a well-known joint in the West. And a parent with a toddler was happy to see him open the fridge on his own,” says Rekha. Between June and August, many started ordering her jars for gifting purposes. By then, Dunzo had also opened up and she started delivering her specialities to customers in Velachery and OMR. Rekha has also set up her cloud kitchen in the neighbourhood itself. “I opened it a couple of days back and have started taking order through Zomato. I would be roping women from other gated communities who will get a small percentage selling the dessert jars,” she says. Vishnupriya is also grateful to neighbours from the community for the encouragement they extended to her. “I started taking referrals from Metrozone customers, which helped me get orders from outside,” says Vishnupriya who is neck-deep in the process of starting a commercial food venture. Saieeji R., joint secretary, Metrozone Owners' Association, says they are happy some of them have moved to start their own commercial venture outside the community. “The rules of the Association does not permit one to run a business from within the society. Lockdown was a unique situation and we did not discourage them, but now as things are normalising we want residents to not commercialise it,” says Saieeji.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/these-home-chefs-are-cooking-up-a-storm/article32825388.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Should schools take lessons from corporates on wellness?||In 2020, amidst a pandemic that has left the corporate world largely working from makeshift, often ergonomically-challenged home offices, Elton Mayo has resurfaced. Mayo’s work in the first half of the twentieth century traced the link between the social side of work — to grab a ready example, the two-minute banter around the water-cooler on that hanging corridor — and organisational health. The pandemic has underlined the significance his theory holds for employee wellness. Organisations now seek to virtually recreate the social side of work. So, you have colleagues sipping coffee together, parked at Google Meet, Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Non-work activities are offered virtually to help employees keep their sanity intact. It is probably equally necessary to recreate the “social side of learning” for students, as they continue to “study from home” with some slipping further into the bog of gadget dependence. “We plan online classes in such a way that children have time to share their daily experiences, interact with their peers and also have some physical exercise. We also plan for a few classes where we all have lunch or snacks together virtually. That way children feel connected with their peers and teachers,” says Abirami .P, counselling psychologist and facilitator-and-counselor at HLC International School in Karanai, off Old Mahabalipuram Road. Communication strategy  Due to the challenges resulting from the work-from-home arrangement and from the pandemic itself, corporates encourage their leaders to practise “overcommunication” with their teams so that they can lead with greater empathy. The study-from-home arrangement obviously requires a similar communication approach from teachers. Peer-level interactions and increased points of contact with teachers are now more necessary than ever before, because challenges are steadily on the rise, states Malathi Karthiban, chief counsellor, Adarsh Student Counselling Centre, which primarily caters to students of five schools and one college in Chennai that come under the Punjab Association. (On account of COVID-19, it has extended its tele-counselling service to children and even adults outside) Malathi points out that the grown-ups in a child’s world, including teachers, should engage children in conversations that can reveal coping difficulties. “There is a world of difference between the concerns children raised at the beginning of the pandemic and now. Earlier, it would largely be academics-related. Now, emotional problems surface more frequently. Aware of COVID-19 deaths in their friends’ circles, some children fear for the safety of their family members, especially the elderly among them. There is much information about COVID-19 out there for the older children to figure out who would be at high risk for complications from the disease. Where younger children are concerned, the problem often stems from an inability to process the situation correctly. It is not unusual for us to come across little children who feel neglected because they are not allowed to step out of their room. With their inability to process the complexities of human existence, let alone the peculiarities of a pandemic, little children tend to equate ‘being quarantined’ on account of a Coronavirus infection with rejection. When a child runs a temperature, it is possible to attempt to persuade them to stay confined in a room and take rest. When the child has tested positive for the virus and is asymptomatic, they have trouble processing isolation measures,” elaborates Malathi. “In these five schools, teachers now set aside two after-school hours every day — between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. — for non-academic interactions with the children of the class they handle, via a WhatsApp group. There is scope for interaction through this group during the weekends too. Teachers are expected to encourage children to discuss their day and anxieties, if any. If there is something personal to be shared, the child would be encouraged to have a one-on-one interaction. At this time, only online intervention is possible and we try to make the most of what is possible,” explains Malathi and points out that teachers of the five schools exchange notes on what works and does not in terms of making the online classes less tiresome for the children. “One of the striking shifts in focus is that the classes now begin with compliments, claps and ice-breakers,” adds Malathi. The family on board  Another takeaway from corporates during the pandemic is how they engaged with the employee’s family, particularly in the early part of the lockdown when they kept their employees’ children engaged through online contests and educative sessions. To give two examples, Prione, which provides technology support services to SMBs, got these children to design sunglasses under a programme called ‘Parents of Prione’. Temenos, a banking software solutions provider, reportedly ran an online soft skills training programme for its employees’ children. Schools could look at organising programmes that would get the student’s family on board. “We have conducted two online programmes engaging the entire family. One was a seven-day programme on gratitude, which encouraged parents to teach their children how to be grateful for the good things in their life, by first practising gratefulness themselves. We felt a need for this programme as the pandemic had led people to take a dim view of their own lives. The families were taught to be grateful not just for the things they had, but also for the things that they lacked and also for the things in their house they no longer had any need for. This way, they were being encouraged to recycle these things by offering them to people who may need them. “The second programme was ‘Lockdown Camp’ in which we called the WhatsApp group, ‘Fun Room’ where every member of the family was being taught life skills,” says Malathi. “We have started our third programme which is a self-care programme for our teachers and it covers the physical, psychological, spiritual, financial and professional aspects of their lives.” Abirami believes that if interventions that activate peer-level interactions are engineered now, when the pandemic is over, students would struggle switching to the old in-person learning environment. In a sense, children are like astronauts on a prolonged stay in space — in this case, it is online space — who would have to make some adjustments as they start living as earthlings again. Abirami says the weaning-off should happen when they are still online. However, the process has to be gently administered. Says Abirami, “The focus should not be only on academics, but also on emotional well-being. We don’t know in what ways children would have been affected during this time.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/should-schools-take-lessons-from-corporates-on-wellness/article32825382.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||A day to remember at the police station||Around 7.30 p.m., on September 29, J. Mari, a Grade-1 police constable, was on duty at Lotus Garden in Kilpauk, and he received a call from the writer at the Kilpauk police station (G-3) asking him to report 30 minutes before the routine evening roll call at 9 p.m. A stream of possibilities raced through Mari’s mind. For, this is something he had never before been asked to do, in all of his 12 years of service. He sought to find out from a few colleagues what it was all about, but they feigned ignorance. As he stepped into the station, Mari was warmly greeted by two dozen police constables and the Station Inspector. Murugesan Kottaiswamy, Inspector (Law & Order), Kilpauk police station, shook his hands, giving him an advanced birthday wish. September 29 was his birthday and the station celebrated it the previous day. An initiative by the Greater Chennai City Police Commissioner, Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, the personnel of all wings of the Police Department, including Armed Reserve (AR), Crime, Law & Order (L&O) and Traffic, are to be given a holiday on their respective birthday. They also receive a birthday greeting card signed by the Commissioner the previous evening. “I was in tears as I had never witnessed such a gathering and a cake being cut for my birthday,” says 35-year-old Mari. Initially, the police personnel were being invited to the office of the Deputy Commissioner or the Assistant Commissioner and given the greeting card. They would cut the cake together. However, due to time constraints and to prevent overcrowding during the pandemic, the celebrations started being conducted in the respective police stations during the roll call every day now. The reason to celebrate during roll call is because all the police personnel are present at the station as they report or sign off from duty at that time. “The aim is to forge bonds between police personnel especially during these uncertain times when they have to risk their lives for the larger good,” says 53-year-old-Inspector Kottaiswamy, adding that the initiative brings a lot of cheer to the entire team. The Greater Chennai Police Commissionerate has 140 police stations divided into four zones — North, South, West and East within its 12 police districts. The department is said to be continuing its earlier practice of wishing police personnel on their birthdays, over a microphone at 8 a.m in the city. The announcer will also convey the birthday wishes from the City Police Commissioner. Now that tradition has been extended to include the cutting of a cake and granting a day’s leave for birthday and marriage anniversary celebrations.  The aim is to forge bonds between police personnel especially during these uncertain times||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-day-to-remember-at-the-police-station/article32825383.ece

Chandramouli, his seven brothers and their families don’t miss participating in the Kapaleeshwar temple car festival in Mylapore. They have been following the tradition of serving food to the poor who attend the festival. The food is cooked by their three cooks. The brothers were getting ready for the festival this year, when it was going to be held in April, and they had kept the stocks in their kitchen. And then the first lockdown came into effect in March, cancelling the temple car festival. But the lockdown restrictions did not stop them from continuing with the tradition of serving the poor. They have been providing them with free food for 156 days between April and September, on the trot. Along with the food, safety kits were also distributed. And, they still continue . “We saw many poor people struggling to manage one square meal a day, and so with some support from our friends and relatives in the city and elsewhere we mobilised funds to serve the poor in the neighbourhood during the lockdown,” says 56-year-old N. Vidyanathan, the youngest among the eight brothers. With the three cooks — Kannan, Krishnan and Kumar at their house on Mathala Narayanan Street near the Jain temple, off Kutchery Road, Mylapore — they divide the work the previous evening. While the work of buying vegetables from the Broadway market and chopping them into varying sizes are carried out by the younger brothers and their children; washing the vegetables, rice and cooking them are done by the cooks and the women in the family. The menu includes sambar rice, vada, curd rice and sweets and a 200 ml water bottle. “Many neighbours supported and helped us continue the free food distribution during the lockdown; some shared our roles and a few others shopped for vegetables at the Broadway market. Many others contributed monetarily,” says N. Pattabi, another brother. Between noon and 2 p.m every day, the brothers and their children, along with a handful of neighbours, visit key roads and intersections in Mylapore, Luz Corner, Mandavali, Santhome, Royapettah and Foreshore Estate to distribute food packets to the needy. Close to 1,200 persons including 300 frontline workers, mainly conservancy staff of the Greater Chennai Corporation were also provided with food on all days including Sundays. The brothers also gave 20,000 free safety kits which included face masks, gloves and hand sanitisers. With the easing of lockdown restrictions by the State government, the brothers have only slowed down the service, and not stopped it.  Many neighbours supported and helped us continue the free food distribution initiative during the lockdown||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/the-lockdown-food-factory/article32825384.ece

Nagar. A few key roads in K.K. Nagar, including R.K. Shanmugam Salai, Ramanathan Salai, P.T. Rajan Salai and Munuswamy Salai, remained waterlogged due to clogged stormwater drains. Residents of these neighbourhoods have asked Greater Chennai Corporation to clean and desilt the stormwater drains. They point out that due to the pandemic the routine cleaning during April and July was not carried out. Besides, they also partly attribute the problem of clogged stormwater drains on some roads to the debris from a SWD-widening work carried out in March before the first lockdown remaining uncleared. The reduced dimensions of the inlets in these drains is believed to be another reason. According to residents, these inlets are not being cleaned regularly. Residents are concerned that water-logging could result in mosquito breeding. Poor illumination  Untrimmed tree branches are said to be blocking the street lamps. “The trees have not been pruned for many months. Although the key roads are well-laid with wide footpaths, regular maintenance is missing,” says K. Satish, a motorist from Ashok Nagar. Many prefer to use R.K. Shanmugam Salai and P.T. Rajan Salai as these provide motorists with easy and quick access to T. Nagar, Teynampet, Nandanam, Nungambakkam, Egmore and Mylapore from areas like Virugambakkam, Porur, Valasaravakkam, Kundrathur, Mangadu and Poonamallee. Moreover, these roads are part of less-congested routes to many other parts of the city. In contrast, Mount– Poonamallee High Road via Guindy and Arcot Road via Vadapalani are marked by bumper-to-bumper traffic during rush hour. In this respect, a Corporation official says, “Steps will be taken to clean the inlets of the stormwater drains soon.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/clogged-stormwater-drains-leave-roads-waterlogged-in-kk-nagar/article32825350.ece

The manhole looks weather-beaten and wornout and its iron rods are exposed. It is remarkable that the manhole was placed just a month ago. The old manhole got broken sometime in February. After repeated complaints to the Zone 11 office of Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC), the broken manhole was replaced in August. The new manhole is already in a pathetic shape and we have to once again take up the issue with GCC. It is obvious that the quality of the work is questionable. This intersection is accident-prone. A few fatal accidents have occurred here. Hence, Rayala Nagar Residents Welfare Association requests the Corporation to do the needful at the earliest. P.V.

As the streets were not milled before they were relaid their height has increased. But the sewer manholes located in the middle of these streets have not been raised to the same level as the streets. As a result, they pose a threat to the safety of vehicle users who have to drive cautiously and avoid these spots. To avoid these manholes, vehicle users drive along the margin of the road and as a result, pedestrians face the risk of accidents. Minor accidents have taken place at these spots. Kaveri Rangan Residents Welfare Association has made several appeals to the Assistant Engineer of Chennai Metrowater Water Supply & Sewerage Board (CMWSSB). But nothing has been done so far. Sewage overflow is another issue that CMWSSB has failed to address in our neighbourhood. Almost every day, for the past three years, residents complain of sewage overflow. Once the north-east monsoon sets in, it is going to be tough time for residents. N.S. Ramachandran and S.

With two of its three gates kept locked at all hours, the Colony did not seek to couch its intentions in any form of ambiguity. It’s only now, after all its three gates are open for outsiders, does the insularity of the past six months come home to its residents. Spread across several acres, the housing society has around 1700 ICF employees who have taken residence there along with their families. With tree-lined streets, a spacious playground, a park and other amenities, ICF South Colony has held out for people outside the locality. And the society has always extended an attitude of welcome towards outsiders, without however compromising on the privacy and safety of its residents. Besides, there was also the question of access that had to be extended to people. Many motorists use the gates of the colony to access a shorter route to Perambur and Anna Nagar. “You skip two signals and reach 12th Main Road by going inside the colony,” says Shahul Hameed, secretary of ICF South Colony Residents Association. A. Udayappan, another committee member, points out that even in pre-COVID days, one of the entrance gates would be kept closed between 10 a.m. and noon to reduce the vehicular flow through the colony.  Precautionary measures When the lockdown began in March, as a precautionary measure against COVID-19, the resident’s welfare association decided to block access to two of its gates. However, the main entrance was kept open with two security guard regulating the movement of motorists. “We had taken various initiatives to keep residents in our quarters safe and these were undertaken after consultation with members,” says Hameed. “We did not want outsiders and vendors to hang out inside the colony, so we put these restrictions in place,” says Hameed. With various restrictions across Chennai having been eased, the Association decided to open its gates. While the main gate is open round-the-clock, the others offer restricted access to outsiders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/the-gates-swing-open/article32825381.ece

It is certainly going to be well-received by regular MTC commuters. Anyone using the App will be spared any unnecessary wait at the bus-stop because it will provide them with the estimated time of arrival of the buses. Hence, it helps us save time. The App shows real-time bus routes along with the respective route numbers. It is possible to track the bus location live. An SOS option is also available in the App. On the question of suggestions, features like seat availability should be incorporated in the app. Besides, all bus stops should be made technologically-smart so that commuters who don’t have smartphones also benefit from LAMB.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Shopping app goes into retirement||In keeping with the easing of lockdown restrictions by the Government, residents of a gated community in Siruseri reportedly put certain in-house restrictions to a vote. A shopping system got dismantled, and so, a free web app that promoted it had to bow out. Created by residents, the app had punctuated shopping processes at two stores on the premises, with calculated pauses to ensure contact-less trading and social distancing. Its popularity growing beyond this community, it was even adopted by another. Despite its evident usefulness, the app lost favour with the residents. Over the last seven months, best-laid plans by RWAs have come unstuck after initial success. In the end, these initiatives are not missteps, only miscalculations. Their applicability and value can’t be doubted. Only that, sometimes, their relevance was overestimated. Sometimes, inherent challenges had been glossed over. At L&T Eden Park, this web app had made it possible for residents to shop at an in-house supermarket and vegetable store, from their living rooms. From a virtual shelf, they could check items into the cart. Before the purchase rolled into the reception, the resident would be notified, thereby cutting out queues in the collection area. In terms of social distancing in a shopping space, this was just what the doctor ordered. Besides, every day, a special hour was earmarked for a pre-determined block which enabled residents of all eight blocks to buy all essentials before these ran out of stock. The creators kept finetuning the app, bunging in features to address previously unacknowledged issues. “Order till availability” was such a feature: It kept the order alive, carrying it over till the item was available at the stores and delivered to the resident. The creators also sought to address a socio-economic question by bringing small vendors — such as the tender coconut and milk vendors — into its purview. And then, reality caught up with it. Sathish Arcot, a resident of L&T Eden Park, says, “The vendors expressed their concern that the lack of shoppers’ footfall was affecting their business. Obviously, if people visited a store they would make more purchases than if they shopped from home. Besides, with government easing lockdown restrictions considerably, residents wanted an in-person shopping experience, of course with safety protocols in place. And this meant the app had to go.”  In the end, these initiatives are not missteps, only miscalculations. Their applicability and value can’t be doubted||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/shopping-app-goes-into-retirement/article32825379.ece

The list includes LED street lights, reflectors, safe service lanes and an ambulance. The demand follows the easing of lockdown restrictions and the resultant resumption of many bus services — both MTC and long-distance bus services. The toll plaza at Porur is one of two such facilities found on the 32-km-long four-lane Chennai Bypass. The other toll plaza is located in Ambattur. “The bus stops at the toll plaza help residents from nearby areas board long-distance buses without having to travel to Koyambedu or Vandalur to do so. However, better facilities are needed at the toll plaza,” says S. Priya, a commuter from Porur. The stopovers and their surroundings at the toll plaza lack basic facilities including sufficient lighting and proper shelters for commuters. A huge number of hawkers can also be seen at the toll plaza selling eatables and a variety of knick-knacks. Toilets at the plaza don’t function properly, and this problem often includes lack of water. The toll plaza at Porur does not have reflectors, warning signboards, barricades and is not sufficiently illuminated at night. Further, vehicles especially lorries would be parked on both sides of the toll plaza especially at night, and due to poor illumination, there is the risk of motorists, especially motorcyclists, accidentally ramming their vehicles into the stationary heavy vehicles. At night, motorcyclists navigate this section, using the headlights from the motorcycles and and street below the Bypass on Mount-Poonamallee Main Road. Motorcyclists point out that with the help of this illumination, they manage to notice the lorries parked near the toll plazas. “Steps will be taken to provide basic facilities at the Porur toll plaza soon,” says an NHAI official.

Recently, Prince Village Phase-I, a gated community in Tondiarpet, opened its gym and play area after much deliberation among residents. Both these amenities have been out of bounds for children and adults since March. With easing of lockdown restrictions, the temporary ban stands lifted. The facilities team ensures the gym and play area are cleaned. At Aashiana Apartment in Venus Colony, Alwarpet, badminton enthusiasts have to book a slot in advance via a WhatsApp group specifically created for it. Only two players can occupy the court at any given point of time. Every two players are given a 45-minute slot, which is followed by a 30-minute ‘no play’ time that is used to carry out cleaning at the court. The court is open only for an hour in the morning and three hours in the evening, as against three and six hours, respectively, before the pandemic. CCTV cameras would be watching over players to check if they are flouting any rules, including if they have come to the court without wearing a mask. “It’s difficult to control everyone and so we need to bring strong rules for the safety of all those living in the community,” says Gopinath V., acting secretary of Prince Village Phase-I Owners’ Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/gyms-parks-open-up/article32825380.ece

The local traffic police has come up with this safety measure because many people were driving at a reckless speed as the carriageway is wide. The one-km-long Link Road has been widened and provided with a tiled footpath. Further, except for the intersections of streets with Link Road, the stormwater drain work has also been completed. The stretch also has a concrete median. However, residents want installation of street lights at the earliest because accidents occur frequently at the intersections of newly-formed streets with Link Road. “Street lights have to be installed because stray animals run across the road and motorists are often caught unawares,” says B. Vasanth, a resident of Poonamallee. The Poonamallee Municipality has to erect lamp posts on the concrete median. However, the installation of street lights is getting delayed purportedly due to funds crunch. In this respect, a police personnel says, “We are following it up with the Poonamallee Municipality and the State Highways Department. However, steps have been taken to mark zebra-crossings on the intersections of the Link Road and the streets. Unauthorised parking of vehicles on both sides of the stretch, especially at night are being curbed to prevent anti-social activities. Further, a police patrol team has been deployed at the intersection of Link Road and Poonamallee High Road.” Multi-storey apartment complexes, commercial establishments and a hospital are located along Link Road. As it is off Poonamallee High Road, many use it to reach Porur, St. Thomas Mount, Guindy and Adyar rather than taking other congested roads.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||The Mumbai poet in Chennai||Any mention of Arun Kolatkar (1931-2004) would bring to mind the image of a man with drooping moustache and unkempt hair smoking away on Thursday afternoons at Wayside Inn in Kala Ghoda, Mumbai, waiting for his friends. Mumbai apart, places that one would associate with modern India’s most elusive bilingual poet would be his hometown Kolhapur; Jejuri, the pilgrim town and title of his most famous book; and Pune, where he died, in pain, of stomach cancer. Not by a long shot would anyone link him with Chennai. Strangely enough, between 1955 and 1957, Kolatkar, still a young poet trying to find a voice in both English and Marathi, lived in Madras, as Chennai was called in those days. Some years after Kolatkar’s death, his first wife Darshan Ladhamal Chhabda sent Arvind Krishna Mehrotra, the poet, literary historiographer and Kolatkar’s great admirer, two plastic folders. Forty years after their divorce, Darshan’s fascination for Kolatkar had not dimmed. The folders contained letters, notes, draft poems and sketches that had passed between the two. But Darshan had prohibited their publication in any form during her lifetime and for some years later; she died in 2011. Life together About as fastidious as Kolatkar, Mehrotra edited the letters with annotations, structuring it as an essay. Titled ‘I Love You, Idiot’, it was published in his Translating the Indian Past and Other Literary Histories (Permanent Black, 2019). It is from this essay that we know of his time in Chennai. In one letter Kolatkar says, “At least 27 letters I must have sent you since you left [Chennai]. How many did you receive?” Only four have survived, all dating to April-May 1957, towards the end of his stay. Born in Kolhapur, Kolatkar matriculated from Bombay University and later joined J.J. School of Art, Mumbai, only to discontinue after a year. In the summer of 1953, he met Darshan and they married early next year despite disapproval from both families. Kolatkar’s was middle-class Brahmin while Darshan came from an affluent Punjabi family with connections to the film world. Kolatkar did not have a job: in fact, in sheer desperation, he even applied for a peon’s job in a newspaper. Then, thanks to M.F. Husain, he took up the painting of wooden toys. Soon, however, sometime in 1955, Kolatkar and Darshan moved to Chennai. The young couple had probably fled an inhospitable situation resulting from their inter-caste and inter-class marriage. Having hopped from one lodge to another the previous year, this was the first time they led a settled life together and it was possibly their happiest. But it would also appear that Darshan was away for considerable amounts of time or there would have been no letters. They lived on Madley Road — the road connecting West (Old) Mambalam and New Mambalam, as T. Nagar was called then. Versatile illustrator Their house must have likely been a modest one. What is now the T. Nagar bus terminus was then a pond. Kolatkar would have taken the suburban electric train often. According to Mehrotra, Kolatkar painted clay pots to be sold on the streets. He could not have made much selling them. In April 1956 he applied for a position as assistant artist in the Ground Training School at the Tambaram Air Force Station, evidently without success. He learnt Morse code but could not find a job as a telegraph operator. It was probably the small monthly allowance remitted by Darshan’s mother that helped them out. Painting clay pots and hawking them was not the only thing occupying Kolatkar. These were productive years. He met the painter Krishen Khanna, who had probably come to Chennai in his job as a banker, and passed on his poems in typescript. These were Early Poems, 1953-55 (a manuscript that, sadly, is forever forthcoming). He also met Shanti Dave of the Baroda School at this time. Kolatkar was an artist himself — in one letter, he refers to himself as a “versatile illustrator” — and the letters to Darshan are full of drawings and doodles. In one letter he asks for “a spray gun for finer type of work.” Whom did he meet According to Mehrotra, Kolatkar made friends among Chennai’s Tamil and Telugu poets and writers. But only four names are mentioned: Sri Sri, Arudra, Gora Sastri and Bairagi, all Telugu writers. Chennai was still the cultural capital for Telugu, although the controversial Andhra demand for the city had been settled a few years ago. The presence of so many Telugu literary personalities is therefore not surprising. Sri Sri and his nephew Arudra were well into their film careers, and had pronounced Left leanings. What conversations Kolatkar would have had with them is difficult to fathom. The Bohemian Bairagi may have provided better company. Mehrotra doesn’t mention any Tamil writer although the city was teeming with them at the time. Jayakanthan, with his powerful short stories, was a rising star. The critic Ka.Naa. Subramanyam was mostly in Chennai at this time. Two years before Kolatkar’s arrival, Ashokamitran had moved to Chennai from Secunderabad and lived on Damodara Reddy Street, a stone’s throw from Madley Road: but he would have been busy at Gemini Studios and in any case he was only beginning his writing career then. The broad-based leftist literary monthly, Saraswati, was at the height of its popularity, but Ci. Su. Chellappa’s little magazine Ezhuthu was still some years away. Evidently, Kolatkar did not establish contact with any of them. Whom did he meet, one wonders. Kolatkar soon tired of Chennai. With prohibition in place he had to settle to drinking plain soda water. And eat pastries at McRennett. Bored, he once sat on a bench in Panagal Park overhearing the quotidian conversation of two lower middle-class families living in Triplicane: “I am feeling nihsaar [worthless]. I am feeling like acres and acres of insipidity. I am not feeling cheerful about anything in Madras. I go about with an offended expression on my face. I have constipation. I have got a snuff-tough cold. I am feeling sick...” Soon after, in mid-1957, Kolatkar returned to Mumbai. As far as I can make out Chennai left no imprint on his writings: unless the idlis and images tumbling out of his famous poem ‘Breakfast Time at Kala Ghoda’ have something to do with his time in the city. The writer is a Tamil historian and author.  Kolatkar soon tired of Chennai. With prohibition in place he had to settle to drinking plain soda water.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Breaking bread||We don’t eat much bread. My husband grew up in Kerala and I, in Odisha. Both households had mothers who devoted themselves to feeding and taking care of not just the immediate family, but a large collection of visiting relatives as well. They cooked endlessly, meals, snacks, masalas and whatever else we demanded — kheer, fruit salad, cake, boondi, pitha... you name it. They also experimented and learnt new recipes and tricks. Very little food was bought. Lots exchanged. Bread was the last resort, either when one was sick, or if for some reason there was not enough time to cook. I grew up in a cosmopolitan city, Rourkela, where the steel plant employed people from across the world. This worked very well to share recipes as the Internet and Google had not been discovered yet. Most recipes were recorded in memory or in notebooks. Ma took recipes from our neighbours and made the most fluffy idlis, crisp dosas, mouth-watering chole, and deep-fried rose cookies. My husband would also fondly recount his mother’s cooking. He has mentioned once or twice, in the 25 years I’ve known him, that Amma used to make a ‘stuffed bread’ once in a while as a treat for the family. So, when I found a rectangular loaf, unsliced, which I had never seen in stores before (or failed to connect with the story of the stuffed bread), I took it as a sign to try that ‘stuffed bread’. Remembered recipe Since this was food from his childhood, and he had the memory and the visuals, my husband took the lead. “First, you have to cut out a small rectangle on top of the loaf, big enough for a small spoon to go in and scoop out the bread. Cut it out carefully as you need to use that piece to seal the bread back again,” he instructed. Then we made a stuffing of boiled potatoes, finely chopped onions, beans, carrots, capsicum. This was cooked together, seasoned with garam masala, chilli powder, salt to taste. “Amma would add one hard-boiled egg chopped into bits to the stuffing,” he said. I had chicken at home, so we cut it into tiny pieces and cooked it with pepper and chicken masala. The vegetables and chicken were combined together to stuffing consistency, with no gravy. Then the scooped-out bread was torn into tiny crumbs and added to the stuffing. We lightly brushed some butter to the outside of the loaf and placed it on a baking tray. With a spoon, we gently placed the stuffing inside the bread. Once all the stuffing was inside the belly of the bread, the opening was sealed with the piece that had been cut out earlier, and a little butter was smeared on top with a brush. Exotic product The oven was preheated for 20 minutes at 180° Celsius. We placed the stuffed loaf in the oven and baked it at 120° Celsius for 20 minutes. It came out slightly crusty on the edges, warm bread appetisingly stuffed, exotic in appearance, and delicious with some fresh onion-cucumber salad and spicy chilli-tomato ketchup. I narrated this story in our family WhatsApp group, which prompted my sister-in-law to recreate the same dish, and that pleased Amma no end. The next generation of nephews and nieces now know of the famous ‘stuffed bread’ and will hopefully make it someday just for the sake of nostalgia, and the recipe will live to tell the tale.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Eat lead||In downtown Mumbai, audacious terrorists strike in broad daylight. Right in front of the security forces, a VIP — namely the SPG of BSF (don’t ask me what that means but let’s suppose it’s something army-related) — gets assassinated, his motorcade is bombed, and there’s immense collateral damage. Despite the assault being meticulously planned and cleverly orchestrated, ostensibly by some foreign hand or the other, investigators Vikrant Singh and his mentor Shahwaz Ali Mirza, who are deputed from RAW to file a report on the case, sense there’s something fishily amateurish about the random shooting and the crude bomb. The suicide attackers turn out to be regular sons of the soil and evidence points towards the involvement of a home-grown sleeper cell. It’s their worst nightmare come true. But as Mumbai police flashes a red alert and ex post facto safety measures are taken, the investigating team begins to suspect a link between the SPG’s killing and a hit-and-run accident a week earlier, in which an ex-PM was severely maimed. Unfortunately, the politician is in coma and can’t shed light on matters. Delightful twists The conspiracy soon appears way bigger than expected and the foreign hand behind it turns out to belong not to Pakistan’s ISI but the West Asian ISIS. A socially conscious cop, Ashok Mankame, who is drafted by the investigators to help out with legwork, has a meltdown and delivers a Bollywoodish speech, “…this is definitely not my fucking world. My world is finding angry teenagers checking out ISIS websites and scaring them by showing them videos of the terrible deaths that they could die in Syria.” Despite such didactic elements that pop up as and when the author gets the urge to lecture, and time-tested tinsel-town tropes like estranged brothers, this book is, broadly speaking, a solidly crafted thriller with several delightfully unanticipated twists. An interesting touch is saintly social worker Rehmat Khan, an informant who turns out to have many strings to her bow. Another is a Hebrew killing machine on loan from Mossad whose name Ben Solo puns on a Star Wars character and who, being invincibly proactive, gets credit for much of the coolest action, while the more realistically portrayed Indian intelligence officers mostly stare at a whiteboard in a safehouse while fiddling with their smartphones, waiting for something to happen. Until one of them, in a comic relief moment of sorts, puts a syringe in the foreigner’s neck to prevent him from hogging their limelight.  The Endgame distinguishes itself from run-of-the-mill pulp by its deep insights into the factual matters that the plot builds on, no doubt due to the author’s credentials. Hussain Zaidi is a well-known name in Indian tabloid journalism, whose work has inspired movies and Netflix shows, whilst his non-fiction bestsellers like Mafia Queens of Mumbai are landmarks in the domestic true-crime genre. This results in an impression of authenticity, of actually getting a peek at what’s hidden behind the smoke and mirrors of the intelligence services, further enhanced by the alphabet soup of acronyms facing us on every page, like NIA, CIA, IB, NSG, DCP, DSG, ATS, etc. Edifying content Unfortunately, though Mumbai usually provides an unparalleled backdrop to any novel, here it is represented only by place names such as Mira Road, Goregaon-Dahisar belt, and Mumbra, geotags that don’t bring the milieus alive for anybody who doesn’t know the city beyond Colaba and Bandra. Pretty much the only local colour in the entire book is a single cup of “cutting chai” ingested during a stakeout. The journalistic spirit further hampers the raciness of an otherwise taut narrative when Zaidi is unable to mute the impulse to provide readers with heavy-handed explanations as well as backstory info-dumps, stuff that ought to be woven into the novel’s fabric. On the other hand, this edifying content is, well, very edifying. The book is written along the lines of other recent works of “faction” — thinly veiled issue-focused essayistic fiction — in which authors provide scenarios around devastating events that might just befall us in these strange times: such as Sidin Vadukut’s Bombay Fever, which prophesied a pandemic breakout in Mumbai, Amitav Ghosh’s Gun Island that dealt with climate catastrophes, even ex-POTUS Bill Clinton’s debut thriller, The President is Missing , which discussed cyberterrorism targeting the Internet of Things and how it might potentially result in a complete shutdown of the American lifestyle. Many important ideas to mull, even if Zaidi’s novel in the end feels like a cinematic treatment awaiting a director and suitable actors to blow life into its protagonists and antagonists.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Beating the lockdown blues||On September 3, 2020, a new record was set in the Indian art world. A 1974 untitled V.S. Gaitonde oil was auctioned by Pundole’s in Mumbai for Rs. 32 crore. The unnamed international buyer bought the 60x40 inch work remotely, over the phone, in what is fast becoming the norm in these times of pandemic. The art belonged to the Glenbarra Art Museum in Japan, owned by businessman and collector Masanori Fukuoka who has one of the largest collections of modern Indian art. It broke the record variously held by another Gaitonde that fetched Rs. 29.3 crore at a Christie’s auction in Mumbai in 2015; Raza’s Tapovan , which fetched Rs. 29.03 crore at another Christie’s auction held in New York in 2018; and by Amrita Sher-Gil’s The Little Girl in Blue that fetched Rs. 18.6 crore at a New York auction in 2015.    The Pundole’s sale is only one of several successful online auctions of 2020. In an economy that has largely suffered during the pandemic, the Indian modern and contemporary art market has not only flourished, it has set record prices compared to previous years. 200 online auctions According to Ishrat Kanga, Deputy Director and Specialist, Head of Sale at Sotheby’s London, the first half of 2020 has seen $575 million in private art sales worldwide, up by 10% from last year.  Sotheby’s latest auction of Indian artwork, Modern and Contemporary South Asian Art, was in London on September 29, and featured 16 unpublished works, including pieces by Gaitonde and Ram Kumar as well as Bhupen Khakhar’s 1971 Portrait of Shri Shankerbhai V. Patel Near Red Fort . The last was estimated at Rs. 4.3 crore and sold for Rs. 19.17 crore. Khakhar, of course, had a huge exhibition at Tate Modern in 2016, lending more visibility to not just the artist but to Indian art in general in the U.K. An important aspect at this juncture, as much as the quantum of sales, is the audience adapting to the changing ways in which art is now viewed. “We have held almost 200 online auctions so far in 2020, four times the number last year. And 88% of all bidders at Sotheby’s in the first half of 2020 were online, over a third of the online buyers were new patrons, and over 25% of our buyers worldwide were under 40,” says Kanga. Art as comfort Last month, artist Waswo X. Waswo had an online party and artist walkthrough, followed by a Q&A, for the opening of his new show at Gallery Latitude 28 in New Delhi. The audience, he says, was global. “A lot of sales happen during the opening, when people meet each other and in the general euphoria, ask gallery owners to save artworks for them. That’s not happening now. So, we held an online opening, and more than a hundred people joined in, from Pakistan, Switzerland, Delhi and Goa.” In August, Kolkata’s Victoria Memorial Hall and New Delhi’s DAG Museums jointly organised ‘An Inheritance of Imaginations’, one of the largest online exhibitions where, probably for the first time, a vast selection of paintings by Rabindranath Tagore and Gaganendranath, Abanindranath and Sunayani Devi Tagore was displayed and discussed. The positive response to online viewings and auctions has taken artists and gallerists alike by surprise. Says Roshni Vadehra, director of Vadehra Art Gallery in New Dehi, “We thought it would be extremely challenging to convince people to buy art during such uncertain times, but the response has been quite amazing. One reason could be that people are at home. They’re not spending on vacations, so they spend on art or they look at art as a source of comfort.”  No government support Galleries are also going out of their way to connect with collectors. ‘In Touch’ is an online collaboration between 10 galleries in India and Dubai, where they pool exhibitions, knowledge, audiences and share prices. Another collective of 15 galleries has come together on a platform called TAP India, started by Sharan Apparao of Chennai’s Apparao Galleries, to hold exhibitions, talks and online events once a month. Vadehra Art Gallery and Nature Morte in Delhi have refurbished their online shops and Sotheby’s has added a ‘Buy Now’ section on its website. The buoyancy in sales, however, doesn’t benefit all artists equally. As Apparao points out, “For every hundred artists, only three succeed. Some have been forced to sell their works cheap because they are not like galleries or collectors who have a cushion.” Waswo, who works with miniature artists in Udaipur, concurs. “I have told the artists who work with me that I can pay them for 12-18 months but other miniature artists, who supply to tourist shops, are selling tea to feed their families.” There is also the matter of non-existent government support. Unlike many other countries, in India, there are no tax breaks or subsidies for artists and craftsmen. Art attracts some of the highest taxes at 12% GST and an import duty of nearly 15%. Apparao says there are many ways in which both the government and collectors can help build up the art market. “It’s not only about sales,” she says. “You’re also talking of collectors building up a base of educational information and about government infrastructure. About more courses, common platforms for performing arts, and government help to struggling artists.” The ways in which the art fraternity has banded together to create new ways to sell art during the pandemic, as well as the unexpected jump in art sales, are great gains. Ideally, this learning should be used as a springboard by the fraternity to adapt and innovate in other ways as well.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||The many blinkered kings||Watching the ‘debate’ between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, two grown men vying to be elected to the position of the most powerful man on earth, I was taken back to the school playground. Trump kept up a constant dribble of interruptions, comments, insults, rejoinders of the level of an eight-year-old. The rules set for the debate didn’t matter, Trump talked and snarled over, under and across both Biden and the helpless moderator. Immediate gratification As an adult, it can be very difficult to face this kind of brainless barrage, whether it comes from a political opponent or a crazed news anchor. If you maintain civility or keep quiet, you’ll be seen as having no answers to the accusations being thrown at you; if you retaliate you will be seen as being no different from the person doing the bullying. It’s a nasty trap and some learn how to set it very early. If it yields results, they refine the manoeuvre and deploy it repeatedly as adults. Usually, however, if a person is president or prime minister of a nation, he or she has an awareness not only of the immediate audience but also of the whole world looking on; they have some sense not only of the immediate moment but also of posterity, of how their words, tone and behaviour might be viewed later on. A juvenile shouting and baiting has no sense of these things — he just wants the immediate gratification of entrapping and destroying his opponent. The man who has managed to become president of the U.S. displayed exactly this greed for instant, fleeting triumph. Or perhaps the subconscious aim was not for a momentary victory but something more long-term; perhaps Trump was addressing not only his core base but also other gullible voters who he imagined would see Biden as weak and indecisive in the face of his assault. Trump is hardly the only current political leader unconcerned about the international community as witness or about the verdict of posterity. This absence of concern is usually found in men crippled by an extremely narrow world view and a very poor sense of history. Tragically for us in India, we seem to have reached a critical mass of such ignorant, power-drunk men who have captured or risen to positions of authority. So the district magistrate and police officer who execute the scandalous cremation of a brutally murdered rape victim do not care that the world may see them as criminals conniving with their political bosses. The investigative agencies concocting evidence and jailing people who are critical of the regime don’t care that their names will join the long list of organisations infamous for torturing their own people. The chief minister who hires a top PR firm to concoct laughable ‘international conspiracy’ theories doesn’t understand that people across the country and the world see through the masquerade. Propped up The officials who freeze the accounts of Amnesty International do not realise that they are reducing their country’s reputation to that of some dictator-run banana republic. The men who engage in the craziest legal contortions — saying, for example, that while the breaking down of a historic structure is a crime, the land it stood on should still be handed over to those who broke it down — seem unconcerned that the country’s once renowned judicial system will stand exposed as shamefully subservient. Nor does this worthy foot-soldier, the one who waves a wand to disappear huge volumes of publicly seen evidence to acquit the self-proclaimed perpetrators, understand that he will go down in history as the worst kind of hollow puppet. The amoral men controlling these officials are seriously impaired in their vision and they pass their blindness down to their vassals, constantly infecting them with their own cowardice. The blindered men at the top depend on their counterparts in other countries, all of them propping one another up, either as allies or in counterbalancing, co-toxic opposition. For instance, the man targeting the Uighurs counts on the man bombing the Kurds who counts on the man mass-imprisoning the Kashmiris who counts on the man targeting the Palestinians who depends on the man demonising the Mexicans. All these men know, but haven’t digested, that history has a way of dealing with despots that is rarely kind. And when the end comes, no amount of lying and bullying and passing the blame will work.  Trump is hardly the only current political leader unconcerned about the international community as witness or about the verdict of posterity||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-many-blinkered-kings/article32825460.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||‘The dissent of Shaheen Bagh was visible and non-violent’||In her new book, Voices of Dissent: An Essay , eminent historian Romila Thapar explores the larger context of dissent, in various forms and at different times, in the Indian past, and relates it to the fractious present. She discusses here the necessity of questioning the world we live in. Excerpts: How have dissent, disagreement and difference of opinion contributed to creating new idioms and building civilisations? Let me explain it with an example: major dissent arose when various sects of Shramanas — Buddhists, Jainas, Ajivikas in particular — expressed disagreement with the premises of Vedic Brahmanism and questioned some of the theories it promoted. For instance, they questioned the belief in deity, the Vedas being divinely revealed, and the efficacy of the sacrificial ritual. Thus, a dichotomy came about between the believers and the non-believers. The Brahmanas referred to the Shramanas as nastikas — non-believers. I try to show in the book that these two became parallel streams of belief. The major institution of the Shramanas — the monk-renouncer and the monastery — was new to society. Other religions were also inspired by the idea of establishing institutions that would enhance religion but also play a social role. How religions controlled societies through institutions becomes apparent through the history of viharas , temples, ashramas , khanqahs and gurdwaras, as well as through charting the patronage to each. These were both places of worship and institutions exercising social control. A 16th-century CE Sanskrit text segregates the Shramanas and the Turushkas — a term used for Muslims — into a joint nastika category, and labels them mleccha . The recognition by those well-established in society of others who did not agree with them is an excellent example of dissent. New questions are asked, new institutions are founded and new forms of patronage emerge. The social process can encourage dissenting groups to become orthodoxies. Religion is not limited to a laudable body of texts; it also shapes society and is shaped by it, attracting dissent. Can there be any advancement in knowledge without questioning the world we live in? No. Disallowing questions is a way of destabilising society and dismantling institutions. That dissent was an essential component of civilisation is evident from the histories of civilisations. They register a high point in philosophical thinking, new visible forms, new literature. This process draws on questioning what is known — accumulations from the past — and providing creative solutions. It was earlier thought that civilisations advanced in isolation. Now we know to the contrary that cultures tend to be porous. The cutting edge of knowledge requires extensive interaction across civilisations. For example, in the late first millennium CE, there began an impressive exchange of knowledge among astronomers and mathematicians across Eurasia. This encouraged new questions with improved explanations, often leading to new technologies that introduced social change. The astrolabe for instance, was invented as a result of questioning, and it eased maritime navigation, which in turn impacted trade in Eurasia. Should voices of non-violent dissent, like those of the women of Shaheen Bagh, be more audible? Why does it remind you of Gandhi? Voices of dissent are more powerful if there is no accompanying violence, to prevent the dissent being dismissed along with the violence. Violence, whatever its source, breeds terror and escalates into uncontrollable disaster. Dissenters generally draw on moral authority rather than violence. When those representing the state lose their moral authority, they may resort to violence in trying to silence dissent. We faced it in the time of the Emergency. Many ask whether it is surfacing again. I think of the 11 ‘activists’ accused of inciting riots in association with the Bhima-Koregaon meeting, nine of whom were jailed two years ago; a few more have joined them now. There has been no trial. There is no habeas corpus . They were not present at the site and gave no public speeches. They worked a long distance away in support of social justice where required. Yet, others known to make public speeches urging their audience to shoot dead the citizens of a particular religious identity remain untouched by the same upholders of authority. Discrimination breeds greater fear of authority. You ask me why today I am reminded of Gandhi and his times and consequently of my youth. Fear of authority evokes earlier occasions. Gandhi and the other leaders had to dispel people’s fear of the British Raj. They provided an alternative way for people to assert their presence in the form of satyagraha. We used to attend the public meetings of anti-colonial nationalists. I still thrill to the slogans that resounded at these meetings — ‘ inquilab zindabad ’ and ‘ le ke rahenge azadi ’. Dissent had to have visibility, but had to be non-violent. The dissent of Shaheen Bagh was visible and non-violent. How did colonialism impact religion? The colonial formulation of Hinduism and Islam differs from the pre-modern. All except the Muslims and Christians were thrown together as Hindus. The history of Hinduism was constructed as a harmonious whole functioning as a uniform monolithic religion. That the experience of religion may have evolved differently in India, articulating a rich diversity of belief and commitment, and incorporating links between caste and sect, was given little attention. That the cultures of India had variant belief systems that were attuned to this diversity, and whose richness lay in how it was negotiated, accommodated or set aside, was not of central interest. Now this colonial reconstruction has taken deeper root with the attempt to reformulate Hinduism as Hindutva, an ideology that moulds the religion to suit a political agenda, namely to legitimise a Hindu Rashtra. How have you not let uncertainties overwhelm you? I have to keep reminding myself that there was a time when we were a society with a strong sense of ethics and a concern with the human condition — implicitly to make it better for every one of us. This comes through in remembered conversations since the last half-century, or even as recently as a few years ago. Dialogues on these matters ensured their primacy. We now live in a different world. The violence of the herd is at our fingertips, notions of justice are conditioned by expediency, the tentacles of corruption capture the law. In these uncertain times, I turn to the perspective of the long duration of the past to justify my faith in the future. We have a long lineage of persons who have argued that love should replace hatred and that compassion should disallow violence in all social behaviour. Today, these have become the voices of dissent. But whatever the future, may these voices continue to be heard.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||The sportswomen of Siwan||Sanjay Pathak is a 45-year-old geography teacher at a government school in Bihar’s Siwan district. In his spare time, he also takes it upon himself to give sports training to the children in his school. In 2009, when two girls from his school — Tara Khatun and Putul Kumari, both 11 — bagged gold medals in athletics at the Panchayat Yuva Khel Abhiyan in the 800m, 1,500m, 100m, and 200m races, Pathak not only discovered two sporting stars in the district, he also became acutely aware of the dismal lack of institutional support and sporting opportunities for such talent in rural areas. “When I saw the medals around their necks, I realised the potential in these girls from Siwan’s villages,” says Pathak. So, in 2016, Pathak cleared up the paddy crop growing on some ancestral land he owned in Laxmipur village and set up the Rani Laxmibai sports club. The club has since earned the distinction of having sent several girls from Siwan to national and State-level tournaments. “Although I am not a sports teacher, I decided I would hone these students’ sporting skills and help them reach international levels.” Four years on, 25 girls from his club have played at the State and national levels in games such as hockey, rugby, football, handball, athletics, and ball badminton. Eight girls have represented India at international tournaments in football, handball and throwball.  But it was no cakewalk. The girls were routinely harassed. . “Young boys would trespass the ground, throw bottles, and play vulgar Bhojpuri songs.” Village elders taunted the teacher for allowing girls to play in shorts. Pathak’s own school staff criticised him, neighbours and relatives hounded the parents. “But I was determined to fight. I used to clean up everything the next morning and start again,” he says. The response from the girls was enormous. Soon, Pathak convinced their parents to allow them to come for training after school hours. And to stay in the hostel in his club.  Not only did Pathak break patriarchal taboos, he also challenged caste-based discrimination. Dalit students are not allowed to mingle with other castes but Pathak ensures that everyone sits and eats together in his home and school. “Parents are not asked questions about religion and caste,” he says.  Village pride From dawn to dusk, some 100 girls practise every day at the club, which is a little smaller than a football ground and surrounded by green paddy fields. The day I visit, the sun is setting and its orange beam lights up a bunch of girls playing handball. Many of the skills that Pathak uses to train them he has picked up from YouTube. Villagers watch from the edges of the field. I ask Jainarayan Singh, 46, about Pathak’s vision. Singh smiles: “Initially Pathakji’s dream sounded like madness to us, but now we all are very happy with his initiative. We are proud of the girls’ achievement because their victories have become international news, and the club is also a matter of pride for our village, district and State.”  “The best thing,” says Pathak, “is that these village girls adopted the spirit of sports despite the lack of a sporting atmosphere. I believe they also wanted to be financially self-reliant.” Radha Kumari won a gold medal in handball at the national level in 2016. Today, she works as a sports teacher in a private school and has become her family’s sole bread-earner after her father’s death. Says her mother, Ramavati Devi, “Zila ka naam raushan kar rahi hai, aur hum iske saath hai (She is bringing glory to the district, we support her).” Sporting success has also helped many girls from underprivileged backgrounds to land that coveted government job. . Tara and Putul have also played for Bihar in U-16 football, and Putul was selected for the national women’s team in 2011. Several of Pathak’s students are now part of the Bihar handball team, while a few have made it to the national team. In athletics, Antima Kumari, 14, won gold in the national school games in the 100m race and Usha Kumari bagged silver in the 400m race in the tournament held at Haridwar in 2015. Amrita Kumari has represented India in the U-14 and U-16 teams at the Asian Football Confederation Cup, while Nisha Kumari was part of the U-14 in 2014 and 2016. Super Salma Salma Khatun, also known as the P.T. Usha of Siwan, has won several medals in school and State games. Her father Sudhan Ansari says that when his older daughter Tara started playing, relatives and friends criticised him for allowing her to play, and that too in shorts. “I did not listen to them; I believed that my family was my strength,” says Ansari, who repairs tyres for a living. “Today I am very happy. My daughter was doing better than my sons and so I sent my two younger daughters also to Pathak’s club.” Tara now has a job in Indian Railways. Pathak even taught his students beach handball, coaching them to reach the State and national levels. For practice, they would travel to Patna, some 150 km away from Siwan, to play on the banks of the Ganges. Now, he has started to make an artificial sand ground in the village. B.K. Sharma, the secretary general of the Bihar Handball Association, laments the negligence of sport by the State and Central governments. “The government sometimes allocates meagre funds to a few players doing extremely well,” he says. “But look at Haryana — it spends money on players and even provides some job security. If Bihar can also do this, it is obvious players will do well.” Pathak’s success comes despite the lack of state support. His club does not have even basic infrastructure — no gym, no trainers, not even a proper ground. The one-room hostel houses 20 girls, with the older girls cooking for them all in a small adjoining kitchen. He is also aware that their diet is poor. “They should get at least four slices of bread, jam, butter, two bananas and an egg for breakfast but I can only provide dalia in the morning and egg once a week,” he says. “Sometimes I worry if I am harming these girls because they don’t get the nutrition they need.”  Pathak spends 25% of his salary to run the academy. But that’s not enough for food, kits, travel and school fees for residential students. Villagers and well-wishers have come forward with funding. A school called Bloombuds is one of Pathak’s biggest sponsors. Pathak’s eyes gleam with hope, “If I can give my students proper diets, a gym and other training facilities, they could win an Olympic medal.” Says Nisha, who has represented India in football in Nepal and Tajikistan, “A lot of people compare Pathak sir with the Dangal film coach Mahavir Singh Phogat; but our coach is very different. Phogat wanted to achieve his dream through his daughter but our Sir has helped us achieve our dreams without imposing anything on us.” And what is Pathak’s dream? “I want to start a trust like Mohun Bagan [Football Club] and bring in people from other States as well. The academy should keep growing even after I am gone.”  The writer is a research scholar at the Academy of International Studies, Jamia Millia Islamia.  So far, 25 girls from Pathak’s club have played at the State and national levels in hockey, rugby, football, handball, athletics, and ball badminton. And eight girls have represented India in international tournaments||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-sportswomen-of-siwan/article32825426.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||The end of the affair||Superpower Showdown , a gripping and granular account of the past, present and future of the United States-China trade war by two former Beijing correspondents of The Wall Street Journal , could just as well have been titled Marriage Story . “Think of this as a romance gone bad,” write Bob Davis and Lingling Wei, as they document in painstaking detail the souring of the U.S.-China relationship in the era of Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. They tell the story of how a relationship that once seemed to be “wrapped in a permanent embrace” of economic interdependence — so much so that it came to be dubbed “Chimerica” by some and described by officials in Beijing as “an old married couple who needed each other, even if they might bicker” — has descended into outright confrontation, with huge implications not just for both countries, but for the world. Rich perspectives There are perhaps no two journalists better placed to tell this tale. Mr. Davis spent three years covering China’s economy at the WSJ ’s Beijing bureau, and subsequently moved to cover trade-related issues in Washington. Ms. Wei has been among the most well-informed reporters covering Chinese politics in Beijing for years, with the kind of access that eludes most foreign correspondents. How did it come to this? This is the question that drives the two writers. The strength of this book lies in the rich perspectives it offers from both Washington and Beijing, presenting a clear insight into the decision-making of both parties, and how, during the course of a turbulent two-year trade war, they came to so often completely misread the intentions of the other. The blame, the writers suggest, lies with both. The book is rich with reporting full of insider details. Two episodes, in particular, stand out. In the autumn of 2012, shortly before his ascension to take over as the next leader of China’s Communist Party, then Vice President Xi Jinping famously went missing for two weeks. He cancelled meetings with visiting officials, including the Prime Minister of Singapore and the U.S. Secretary of State, at the last minute. The disappearance triggered feverish speculation among China-watchers, who were gripped that year by the political intrigue surrounding the purge of Bo Xilai, Xi’s rival. The enduring mystery of Xi’s disappearance has a somewhat mundane explanation, the writers suggest. Xi retreated from Beijing with a group of close advisers to Zhuji, a small town on the Yangtze river in Zhejiang province, where he served as a provincial leader. Those two weeks would, however, end up being very significant in determining the future course of Chinese politics. Xi and his advisers came up with his “China Dream” campaign in Zhejiang, and deciding to make the “rejuvenation” of China their central agenda — heralding a turn towards nationalism. Lessons for India The book also sheds new light on the now famous April 2019 meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, where China’s leaders did a u-turn on agreeing to a trade deal. The book says three of Xi’s fellow members took him by surprise by how vociferously they objected to the deal, which had been shepherded by Liu He, a close adviser of Xi’s. Third-ranked Li Zhanshu, head of China’s legislature, told Xi on key U.S. proposals to amend Chinese laws to protect foreign firms that “no country has the right to tell China what laws it must amend.” Top party ideologue Wang Huning and vice premier Han Zheng were other strong voices in favour of tearing up the deal. The book leaves us with four important lessons that may be of particular relevance for India as it looks to navigate what will continue to be a stormy U.S.-China relationship. Firstly, the lesson from the April 2019 Politburo meeting, in the authors’ view, is that as different as the two political systems are, “Chinese leaders still face constraints”. It tells us how Chinese decision-making works. Xi “couldn’t afford to be seen weak in dealing with the Americans.” He would end up relenting and taking a harder line on the deal to fend off criticism. Secondly, should Trump remain in office post-November, the book offers many lessons in how U.S. decision-making works too in the Trump era. It gives Trump credit for taking on China and addressing structural concerns that previous administrations had ignored, but is unsparing in assessing his deficiencies. He “started the biggest trade war since the 1930s,” they wrote, “with only a superficial understanding of how China worked and without a specific goal in mind or plan to achieve success”. The trade deficit, they note, would only continue to grow on his watch. His biggest failure would be his disdain for working with U.S. allies, one reason, they suggest, for his inability to achieve what he wanted on the China front. It doesn’t paint Trump’s team of advisers in a very favourable light, instead showing us a rather chaotic White House that operated without any strategic vision, instead lurching from decision to decision to appease the whims of its very distracted current occupant. Thirdly, the book notes how the U.S. trade and technology war, that has certainly crippled the ambitions of Chinese tech giants from Huawei to ZTE, is spurring an even more ambitious Chinese move towards technological self-reliance. The “Anke project” (or to make China “secure and controllable”) is looking to purge Chinese government agencies, telecom firms and power-grids of all foreign software and hardware. Under its “352” rule, they will allocate 30% of all contracts to domestic providers in 2020, an additional 50% in 2020, and the remaining 20% in 2021. The great tech divide is here to stay. And so is the U.S.-China divide. The book, finally, makes a strong case for why Trump may be a part of the reason for the end of the affair, but he “is not the entire answer.” The shift in U.S. attitudes towards China is much bigger than Trump. It is not only bipartisan, but most importantly, has now extended to many U.S. companies as well, who for long were happy to be Beijing’s most vocal lobbyists in Washington. The trade and economic battle didn’t start with Trump, and the book tells us it certainly won’t end with him.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||The difficulty in understanding the word ‘no’||For her book Why Men Rape, Tara Kaushal spent a week each with nine men who have allegedly raped but haven’t been convicted for various reasons. She visited them in their homes, spoke to them, their families and friends, and tried to understand their history and milieu in order to decipher the underlying motives of rape. Her enterprise and courage must be lauded. She created a different persona, took along a male colleague, gained the men’s confidence, and made them respond to the same set of 250 questions each. What she culled from the interviews does not add any startling new perspective to our understanding of rape, but it is still a commendable project. The loyalty test All sorts of men from all backgrounds rape, but what is common is the broad rubric of patriarchy. Boys are brought up with notions of masculinity that demand from them a violent and competitive sexual and social presence. They also grow up with a deep sense of entitlement. As Kaushal notes, Indian boys grow into manhood never having heard the word ‘no’. Equally important, it is ingrained in Indian men that their first loyalty is to the natal family. This explains the constant endorsement of the ma-behen concept — because outside of this framework, men are unable to respect women. The men Kaushal spoke to have had no sex education. They are ignorant not just of the sexual act but also of women’s bodies and minds. In many cases, they don’t know what ‘rape’ is. Forcing oneself upon resisting women is not understood as rape but as normal sex because they grow up internalising that women will always resist due to modesty but this need not be taken seriously. Worse, aggressive possessiveness and violent acts of possessing are equated with deep love — a notion fondly peddled by film directors like Sandeep Vanga. The proprietorial control of women also then becomes the basis of honour rape and war rape — when a woman is violated to punish her ‘owner’, the man. Social network Kaushal reiterates two other important aspects. One is societal rage born of extreme social disempowerment — many of these men are poor, oppressed and brutalised themselves. Second is the unlimited pornography available on mobile phones. As one subject tells Kaushal in a fit of self-disgust, “Jio se free internet band karo .” (Stop free internet from Jio.) Violent pornography mixed with zero sexual awareness makes for a toxic cocktail. Case studies are always interesting and one wanted to see each history systematically traced from beginning to end. Unfortunately, the book keeps jumping between case studies, research and comment, making one lose track and patience. The book can’t decide if it wants to be social treatise, WhatsApp chat or Netflix movie script, jerking from academic prose to street slang to dialogue and homily. An informal style is fine but to litter the text with chat acronyms and accompany each WTF with a footnote is a bit precious. It is baffling that the acronym SO should be used at all with ‘significant other’ as a painstaking footnote. Also, the frequent digressions to state opinions or make interjections — “Whoa, dude, chill out; why so serious…” — get banal. Or, perhaps, all these points that I see as drawbacks make the book a perfect millennial read.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Anxiety in 280 characters||Has anybody else that has the luxury of home and hearth in these times experienced increased instances of anxiety? The feeling that every new day will bring a new disaster and a new unforeseen event, the contours of which could neither have been predicted nor controlled? Open the newspaper any given day of the week or listen to your favourite news anchor screaming their heads off at yet another hapless invitee, depending on your poison, and you will probably have more fodder to fuel such a feeling. WebMD tells me that anxiety is a normal emotion. And that it’s a way of alerting the brain to potential danger and a standard reaction to stress. But when all that I consume every day is meant to create the feeling of potential danger, is it a wonder that I am permanently anxious? Online threat  The Social Dilemma on Netflix makes the compelling argument that online platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are meant to nurture this addiction to anxiety and affect my mental health. A recent debate organised by NDTV and Roli Books argued the motion, ‘In a democracy, social media does more harm than good.’ Proponents for the motion cited the rise of hatred, bigotry, fake news, and violence of both the online and offline kind. Those against argued for the role of social media in the amplification of dissent, resistance and the voices of the marginalised in society. Sociologist and Marxist writer Richard Seymour’s book The Twittering Machine suggests instead that it would be easier to ask as to what is wrong with us rather than what is wrong with these systems. And he makes the perhaps controversial argument that compulsive participation in social media, whether as participant, spectator or addict to the dopamine loops of ‘likes’ and ‘retweets’ is not due to a need for pleasure but a symptom of the death drive, a giving in to the chronophage or the “monster that eats time.” In other words, we stay online to pass time, for real time in the real world is fraught and cannot be passed so easily. When I was a child, I was in thrall to that allay-er of all anxieties, the institution of the bedtime story. Through familiar parables of good and evil, offered in turn by my maternal grandfather, my father and my mother, I was offered the possibility of a world in which one could thrive, but of course, only if one followed the rules. Bedtime fiction Today my phone and social media keep me company before bedtime. Whatsapp forwards and Twitter and Facebook propel me into the fiction that both the good and the bad are constantly elsewhere; somebody else is always happier, better-looking, and travelling to nicer places and somebody else is constantly cruel, inhuman, illiberal, and brutal. At the same time, they also contrarily inform me that all happiness is within my reach whether through re-invention of self, new hobbies, Instagram-influencing, or follower-gathering. So then, in this moment and this space, I ask again, is it a wonder that we are all permanently anxious? But maybe there is a way to elide this Manichean back and forth of social media by focusing on anxiety as a symptom to revisit the question of what may be wrong with us. Philosopher Renata Salecl in her beautiful exploration ‘On Anxiety’ is wary of the popular account that anxiety is an obstacle to well-being and prevents us from functioning in the world or engaging with others. Instead, she says that a world without anxiety would be a scary place for it would give truth to the lie that happiness is freely available, and that we are not in an age of cruelty, misery and danger. Perhaps we are all anxious because no matter how hard we scroll, how incessantly we post, and how intently we binge-watch, we do not have the capacity to deny the state of the world. To rephrase anthropologist Clifford Geertz, we are unable to believe the stories we are telling ourselves about ourselves. Anxiety in this case can be a powerful space to stay in and to ask about the stories we no longer tell, and perhaps even to find newer, better and kinder stories of the world.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/anxiety-in-280-characters/article32825472.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Embalmed epistles||I have a bunch of old unsent letters with me, entrusted to me by my colleagues years ago to be dropped into the postbox of a main post office on my way home from office. Those were the days when people solely depended on the postal service for communication. Couriers were unknown. E-mail was science fiction. I forgot to post these letters, though their poor authors repeatedly pleaded that I should not for heaven’s sake forget to post them. Now after 30-odd years, I am not able to forget the words of caution with which each of them was handed over to me. The oldest is an inland from one Mr. T who said, “Please post it at T. Nagar main post office. It carries a very important message. Heads will roll if it fails to reach the addressee by tomorrow.” This letter dated March 11, 1981 is still lying in front of me. When I first found it lying in my bag about two weeks after I undertook to post it, I panicked. I thought of immediately posting it at the General Post Office. But my brother to whom I confessed my crime told me not to do so. “If you post it now, the postal mark will give you away. If anything bad was to happen due to this letter not reaching the addressee, it should have happened already,” he said. I took his advice and placed it in a black box in which others of its kind were laid to rest. Once I even felt tempted to open these letters to know if they really contained any important message or matter. I nipped this urge in the bud not only because I considered it indecent to read others’ letters but also because I feared that they might haunt me for a lifetime. I can neither post them now nor bring myself to destroy them. I know there is the Dead Letter Office, where undeliverable letters get dumped. Once I thought of sending these forgotten-to-be-posted epistles there. But I gave up that idea. The reason was that these letters are not dead. They are very much alive. Whenever I touch them, they give me a mild shock. I am sorry to mention here that three of the writers of these live letters are dead. It is ironic that the letters are alive, but their writers are not. Could anyone suggest a way by which I can be delivered of these live letters? mr.m.r.anand@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/embalmed-epistles/article32825417.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Prisoner of the white lights||Before the advent of Zeenat Aman and Parveen Babi, there were only two types of heroines—the vamp who smoked, drank and wore western clothes and the good girl who wore a sari and wept buckets. And so while Zeenat’s Jasbir tripped the light fantastic in Hare Rama Hare Krishna, (1971) Parveen Babi as Sunita lived in sin with Vijay in Deewar (1975) or captures Anthony Gonzalves’ heart as Jenny in Amar Akbar Anthony (1977). Time freeze In Parveen Babi A Life , film journalist Karishma Upadhyay chronicles the highs and lows of Babi’s life. Her film career kicked off with B.R. Ishara’s Charitra (1973) and wound down in 1991 with Iraada , with a couple of absences along the way. While the book tells the story of a shy girl from the royal family in Junagadh in Gujarat through the prism of Babi’s mental illness, the book is addictive for capturing the zeitgeist of the 1970s and ’80s. Starting dramatically with Parveen threatening to jump out of a car and strip on the Andheri flyover, on the verge of a breakdown, the book moves back to Parveen’s childhood in Junagadh, losing her father at the age of six, her difficult relationship with her undemonstrative mother, Jamal, her move to Ahmedabad to study in St. Xavier’s College in 1968 and her move to Bombay to try her luck in films. In college, Parveen reinvented herself morphing from a painfully shy salwar-kameez clad girl to a gorgeous, confident-looking woman. Parveen’s excellent memory helped her get by college with minimal effort and also stood her in good stead during her acting career. She was not the best actress around, but she was conscientious and would always remember her lines. Upadhyay chronicles the three great loves in Parveen’s life—actors Danny Denzongpa and Kabir Bedi and director Mahesh Bhatt. Having spoken extensively with all the three men, Upadhyay is able to create an unforgettable picture of a woman who loved not too wisely but too well. While Parveen’s obsession with Amitabh Bachchan is mentioned, and the rumoured affair delved into, there is no quote from the Big B. Myths busted Along the way there are myths busted such as Parveen’s drug addiction (the actor never touched them). Apart from the three men, Upadhyay spoke to over a 100 people who knew and worked with Parveen, from her college friends to her manager Ved Sharma who went far beyond the call of duty and costume designer Xerxes Bhathena. The book also quotes from film magazines with screaming headlines such as “Parveen Babi’s fight for sanity” or “Kabir Bedi exposes the lies Parveen told” and “Parveen Babi: Fed up of being the poor man’s Zeenat Aman.” The book quotes from ‘The Confessions of Parveen Babi’, which the actor wrote for The Illustrated Weekly in 1984. Parveen’s description of her breakdown is poignant especially as she continued to work, while in a fragile state. The industry was not very kind to her when she went away. They, however, welcomed her back every time thanks to Sharma’s hard work and her work ethic. With photos and nuggets, the book brings alive the fun and heartbreak of the days when the common man could only guess at what the stars were up to in their ivory towers.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||The count||South won the opening spade lead with dummy’s ace and drew trumps in three rounds, West discarding two high spades. West was sure of the spade position, as South would not have asked for aces with more than one low spade in his hand. Declarer, who was cold for his contract if diamonds split 3-2, was in no rush to start on diamonds. He led a club to dummy’s ace, a club back to his king, and ruffed a club with dummy’s last trump. West discarded another high spade. South now knew that West started with 6-1-4-2 distribution — bad news for his contract. He ruffed a spade in hand as West followed with another high spade. Declarer crossed to dummy with the ace of diamonds and led dummy’s last spade. East followed with the eight and South was pretty sure that West had discarded enough high spades that he would not be endplayed if South discarded a diamond now. Instead, South ruffed the spade with his last trump — West following with the three — and exited with a low diamond. West won with his nine, but he was end-played after all. Despite his brilliant effort to avoid an end-play, West now had to lead from his queen of diamonds into South’s king-jack. Beautifully played and defended!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-count/article32825465.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Iron and steeling self||Respected Madam/ Sir,  This is the diary of Mr. J. Mathrubootham. Please publish in full detail. Don’t behave like TV news channel and only release cut piece. It is the story of the greatest irritation in the whole world. 10 a.m.: Mrs. M is switching on ironing box to put iron on one saree. 10.07 a.m.: Smoke is coming from ironing box like Prabhu Deva dancing in Mani Ratnam film. 10.08 a.m.: Mrs. M is continuing to use iron box because smoke and all nothing for Mrs. M who once drove car with puncture tyre for 7 km to see actor Madhavan film. Maybe Alaipayuthey . 10.11 a.m.: Iron box is catching fire. 10.13 a.m.: Mrs. M enters living room to say hello do something iron box is on fire. She said this with same emotion as if saying ‘Bread is finished’ or ‘TV remote is missing’. 10.14 a.m.: I am running to fuse board and switching off electricity. Then I sprinkle water on iron box. Fire is stopped. I put one vote of thanks to Guruvayoorappa. 10.20 a.m.: I am looking at e-commerce website for new iron box. 10.21 a.m.: Whether any purchase can happen without UN type discussion? Never. So Mrs. M is immediately asking where is tree. I said tree? What tree? Did you set tree also on fire? She said tree, the one with money growing. Why you are buying new iron? Let us do repair first. 10.22 a.m.: Let us buy new iron. No means no, Kamalam. I won’t negotiate. 10.23 a.m.: Ok fine let us repair iron. 10.25 a.m.: Electrician is too much busy but he said let us do WhatsApp video and I will see if repair can be done. He said please call at 11 a.m. sharp. 11.00 a.m.: We called electrician. Nothing. 11.05 a.m.: Again we called. Again nothing. 11.15 a.m.: Once more call. Once more nothing. 11.20 a.m.: Electrician is calling. I am taking bath. Unable to talk. 11.30a.m.: I run out wearing only turkey towel. Finally he is picking up. 11.35 a.m.: For one hour what all gymnastics we did. I am holding iron like this, Mrs. M holding phone like that. Then I am holding iron like that, she is holding phone like this. Electrician is laughing like anything. Mrs. M is silent like anything. 11.47 a.m.: Electrician giving long list of spare parts. He said 100% repair is possible. Why to waste money. Mrs. M face as if she won Sikkim Lottery. 12.00 p.m.: Trying shop for parts. But brand long ago sold to European company. No parts possible. 12.06 p.m.: Voice telling service centre number. 12.18 p.m.: Calling service centre number and asking for iron box parts. Voice said, uncle, this is pizza centre, whether you want pizza or no. I said, ok and put one online order. Hungry like anything. 12.30 p.m.: Another one service centre. I am asking for spare parts again. Man on the phone is laughing like anything. Uncle, this iron is from 1980s. Nobody is making anymore. 12.45 p.m.: Pizza person called and said sorry sir, fire in hotel and all orders cancel. I said, oh my god, please give refund. He said sir, please call service centre for refund. 1.00 p.m.: No reply from pizza service centre. Another service centre man is saying iron parts available but minimum one month required. I said thank you, in one month I can go to Salem, buy steel, return and make iron box myself. 1.12 p.m.: Mrs. M asking where is pizza? I said fire in hotel. She said where is refund? I said service centre lines all busy. Let us order something else. She said, never. Until we get refund no more phone orders. 1.13 p.m.: Iron box gone. Pizza gone. Now one new thing is on fire.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Ruminating over old IMs||My old smartphone alerted me to its dwindling storage space as WhatsApp and its undeleted messages occupied two-thirds of the memory. Deciding to delete old chats, I chanced upon conversations from four or five years ago. Those texts were from happier and sad times and when I could have dealt with conversations with more maturity. I realised a new kind of reminiscence fast emerging — one that can only be viewed and eludes other senses. Instant messages (IM) lack the fragrance of that old teakwood cupboard at grandma’s place or the musty smell of grandpa’s books. They are not like the photo album with a layer of dust waiting to be wiped off and held. Nor do they sound like the souvenir tin of chocolates emptied with our best mates long ago and now carrying a few pins, clips, and cheap jewellery. Old chats from a couple of years ago lack “antiquity”, but they hold special value because they serve as a reflection of who we were and where we were headed as a social animal. Texts make us question our past selves. We could cringe at that emoji we sent to an arrogant show-off. Or we could be humbled by a heartfelt note of appreciation for a petty service. Old chats serve as a testimony to our life’s path, the direction it has taken through the choices we made. The era of letters, or snail mail, basks in unique glory. People were aware of another’s reality on a longer time scale — a reality that changed slowly and shared many common elements with our own. In an era when a sender knew about a receiver’s culture and attitudes, minds hardly stressed about reactions. What made a letter cherished is the effort of putting pen to paper, portraying sparks of imagination even while being fully present in one’s own reality, excitement of sliding it in a letter box and surprising the reader on delivery. The accompanying wait and enthusiasm to receive it enriched the entire experience of communication. Immediate reality The IM scenario is starkly different. For one, we do not know the immediate reality of the receiver to expect instant gratification. Unmet expectations naturally build tensions and anxiety. Bombarded with a cacophony of opinions, emotions and updates 24x7, IM is enough reason for a burnout. The idea of IM apps was to connect people and bring them closer. In contrast, we are socially disconnected from the people around us. By creating personal micro-cultures, we have chosen to seek comfort and a sense of identity on the other side of the screen by disregarding their personal reality. True connection lies in our decision to send a heart-warming note rather than a meaningless forward to our dear ones. It lies in our decision to inform our peers we need time off to pick up our pieces rather than block them curtly without answering their concerns. It also lies in our decision to call and talk about our emotions rather than text them. Why did we start fearing calls that can put our mind at ease in an instant rather than wait for a text? Because the other side is busy or to avoid confrontation? Or maybe, we fear embarrassing our vulnerable selves in person to be deluded by the idea that texts provide a safer outlet? The most difficult conversations that happen over texts leave both parties in despair because of misinterpretation. The question now is, are texts overwhelming us? What we choose to do between ignoring, delaying our response or instantly responding is how we break or build connections. If there’s one reason why people overthink before connecting via IM, it is the pressure to come across as being politically right, and convey their message without misinterpretation. darshyazh@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/ruminating-over-old-ims/article32825419.ece

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Biological plant-virus ‘arms race’ uncovered||Plants and viruses are constantly involved in a race to outdo one another, and their lives literally depend on this. A new study with researchers from National Centre of Biological Sciences (NCBS-TIFR), Bengaluru, has discovered a new step in this arms race between the virus called Synedrella Yellow Vein Clearing Virus and the plants it attacks. The virus was isolated by the researchers from a plant named Synedrella nodiflora, and it was able to infect tobacco and tomato plant in their studies. Large family This virus is a representative of the Begomovirus family of viruses. “Begomoviruses are a large family with about 400 members. They infect economically important plants and are a major reason for crop loss,” explains Ashwin Nair, from NCBS-TIFR, who is the first author of a paper on the work published in BMC Biology. “We think SyYVCV can infect many more host plants.” Attacks, counter-attacks The arms race typically happens like this: The virus first attacks the plant, and the plant has defences that are actually counter-attacks – mechanisms that seek to destroy the virus. In turn, the virus develops a counter-counter-attack by trying to escape being destroyed by the plant’s mechanisms. In the case of the Synedrella Yellow Vein Clearing Virus, it happens this way: When the virus attacks the plant, it produces vein-clearing symptoms which make the plant look beautiful. The fact, however, is that this does not make it better for the plant. It actually makes it difficult for the plant to produce flowers and fruits. “Without BetaC1, a viral protein, the virus will not be able to defeat the host attacks and also will not be able to completely infect the plant, as the virus will not be able to move through the veins of the plant,” says P.V. Shivaprasad, in whose lab at NCBS-TIFR the work was carried out. In turn, the plant develops defence mechanisms to destroy the virus. It targets the protein called BetaC1 made by the virus which helps in successful infection and intracellular movement within the plant. Plants degrade BetaC1 protein of virus by tagging this protein with another smaller protein called ubiquitin. Viral response In their study, the researchers found that, in response, the virus uses the plant’s machinery to create a small modification of the BetaC1 protein. It adds a tiny protein called SUMO to the betaC1 protein in a process termed SUMOylation. “BetaC1 hijacks the SUMO pathway machinery of the plants and makes itself a substrate for SUMOylation. Essentially, BetaC1 mimics or tricks the host SUMOylation machinery as if it is one of the host plant protein requiring SUMOylation,” explains Prof. Shivaprasad. Kiran Chatterjee and Ranabir Das, also at NCBS-TIFR, collaborated in understanding the nano-scale SUMOylation process, because such small interactions can only be studied by special protein-protein structure determining techniques Tiny virus The study used tobacco plants. The virus is fairly new. Says Dr Shivaprasad, “We isolated it in 2018 and have not studied its prevalence in other crops. Viruses very similar to this virus are the biggest threat to crop production throughout world.” Apparently, in infected fields, up to 60% of horticultural crops are lost due to begomoviral infection. Viruses can range in size from 5 nanometre to 300 nanometre. The studied virus, which falls under the category geminivirus, is among the smaller ones, measuring about 20 nanometres. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, for instance is about five times larger than these. Within this small size, they make proteins that are comparable in size with those of the plants that help them function. The difference comes in the number of proteins they make. While the rice plant makes about 35,000 proteins, and we humans make about 20,000 proteins, geminiviruses code for just 8-10 proteins. The larger SARS-CoV-2 virus codes for about 25 proteins. New results “These concepts are new to plant–pathogen interactions. Previously, researchers did find the significance of other protein modifications, but not the ones we have found in this study,” says Dr Shivaprasad. “Our results also provide newer tools to identify and generate plants that can resist viruses.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/biological-plant-virus-arms-race-uncovered/article32824848.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Spiders spin a tale of migration||About 55 million years ago, when the Indian Subcontinent collided with Asia, many plants and animals migrated from India to other parts of Asia. Now, by studying the evolutionary history of a spider family, researchers have tried to map the dispersal event from India to the islands of Southeast Asia 55–38 million years ago. The team from the Institute of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted extensive field surveys in Tibet, Nepal and Sri Lanka, and genetic studies were carried out on over 100 global spider species. Based on the climate and the current distribution of these spiders, they concentrated on 12 regions including South and Central America, Africa, Madagascar, India, Sumatra, Fiji and Borneo. Common ancestor The constructed histories show that a spider subfamily called Theotiminae might have come from Africa, whereas a sister family called Ochyroceratinae had a South American origin. This means they had more than one common evolutionary ancestor and the taxonomy might even need revisions. Why not to East Asia? One question the researchers were trying to answer was: Why did the spiders not migrate from India to East Asia? They note that, in contrast to the tropical and wet regions of Southeast Asia, East Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea and Mongolia, had an arid climate with less than 800 mm of annual precipitation during that period. “Despite no obvious geographical barrier, this dry or seasonal climate acted as barriers to the colonisation of East Asia by theotimines,” explains the paper published in Systematic Biology.  Role of climate Also, during that period, the Tibetan Plateau developed into a mountain belt with almost 4000 m height and the colder and drier climate was also unsuitable for the spiders. “Our analyses suggest that climate plays a more important role than geology in biological migration from the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia, providing new insights into the Indian–Asian biogeographic link,” notes the paper.  During the field study the team noted that in some areas, the spiders were found in leaf litter in the forests, while in others they were occupying caves. Habitat shifts The researchers write that these habitat shifts also occur depending on the climate of the area. “Most caves have an almost constant temperature and high humidity throughout the year, providing suitable shelters for theotimines in seasonally variable environments. Species in a wet environment can live in the litter or caves, whereas species in an environment with low precipitation are more often found in caves,” adds the paper. The team writes that an “integrative approach combining different sources of evidence, such as biogeography and ecology,” can provide a more realistic reconstruction of evolutionary history. They predict that other organisms distributed in the tropical zones may also exhibit similar mechanisms of migration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/spiders-spin-a-tale-of-migration/article32824835.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||U.S. universities rely on rapid tests for safe campus return||As educational institutions in India are set to open to students under Unlock-5, colleges and universities can make students return safely by following the example of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the U.S. and other American universities. To ensure safe return, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign began an ambitious initiative in mid-August to test for free all students, faculty and staff for novel coronavirus using a rapid saliva-based test that was developed in-house. Testing of faculty and staff began in July. Frequent testing Despite the low sensitivity compared with RT-PCR, rapid antigen tests were preferred as they were quick, cost less and therefore allowed frequent testing on a large scale. To compensate for the low sensitivity of rapid tests, all the students, faculty and staff were compulsorily required to get tested twice a week. Rochelle P. Walensky and collaborators from Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, modelled different scenarios to safely re-open campuses. They report in JAMA Network Open that “symptom-based screening alone is not sufficient to contain an outbreak. Safe reopening of campuses in fall 2020 may require screening every two days, besides following good prevention practices”. The symptom-based approach will also miss detecting asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases, which form a majority according to a paper in the journal PNAS .  When a student tests positive, he/she is informed of the result and asked to isolate, and all contacts who spent more than 15 minutes within six feet distance from the index case are traced and asked to quarantine. While just 311 fresh cases were detected from August 17-23, a spike in fresh cases was seen in end-August and early-September when 549 new cases were detected in just three days. The university was forced to undertake partial lockdown on student activities. The spike in fresh cases attracted huge media criticism, and Nigel Goldenfeld and Sergei Maslov who were involved in the programme were pilloried for the outbreak. Besides the students testing positive at the time of entry, it was found that students who tested positive violated isolation and partied leading to large spread. The testing programme was based on modelling studies that took into account how students socialise, including attending parties without wearing a mask. “We modelled that they were going to go to parties and that they probably weren’t going to wear masks, and it would lead to some level of transmission. What we didn’t model for is that people would choose to go to a party if they knew that they were positive,” Martin Burke from the University’s Department of Chemistry who helped develop the saliva test told Nature.  Improvements to note Following some restrictions on student gatherings for two weeks, fresh cases reported have since dropped — from 230 cases on August 31 (test positivity rate of 1.34%) to 25 cases on October 6 (test positivity rate of 0.24%). “It’s good to praise improvements. Once campus reopened, we had no choice but to do everything we could to reduce spread. The restrictions helped. But we need to avoid equating relative improvement with absolute success. The plan was not and still is not a success,” Daniel Simons, a cognitive psychology Professor at the university tweeted. Model system Up to 10,000 students are tested each day and totally over 4,92,000 tests have been done till October 6 with a seven-day test positivity rate of 0.28%. “Surveillance and rapid response are part of any reasonable plan. That they did this and it worked was a huge success,” Carl T. Bergstrom from the University of Washington tweeted. Today, the University’s mass testing programme is being touted as a model system and many universities — Yale University, Indiana University, Harvard University, University of Georgia, University of Wisconsin — have emulated it. Dr. Giridhara Babu, epidemiologist from the Public Health Foundation of India, Bengaluru, is not upbeat in replicating this strategy to detect cases and break the transmission chain when students return to colleges/universities. In an email to The Hindu, he says: “It is important not to blindly increase the testing numbers without the end goal. In public health, it is also important to ensure that necessary interventions such as isolation centres which provide the standard of care are arranged before scaling up universal testing when a screening mechanism is implemented in universities/colleges.” He is also concerned about the cost of using rapid tests repeatedly. “With the current costs, I am also not sure if this strategy can be employed at scale in India,” he says. The other side Despite the advantages of detecting asymptomatic cases early and thereby breaking the transmission chain, he is in favour of testing those who show symptoms. “From decreasing mortality, the mainstay of testing will still be to find those who have symptoms and test them rather than randomly testing everyone and every time. Testing is only a tool to know if transmission is present, that too an imperfect one. It is not mere numbers, improving the overall testing strategy of finding those who have symptoms, through syndromic approach might be more beneficial in India,” Dr. Babu says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/us-universities-rely-on-rapid-tests-for-safe-campus-return/article32824836.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Study says antibody cocktail may protect against COVID-19||The experimental antibody cocktail which U.S. President Donald Trump received when he tested positive for COVID-19 offers benefits against the novel coronavirus infection, according to a new study in animal models which provides more evidence of the clinical potential of the therapeutic. While earlier studies had shown that the cocktail of two antibodies targeting the coronavirus spike protein could be used to neutralise the pathogen, scientists from the American biotechnology company Regeneron noted that further research in multiple animal models is needed to test the effectiveness of the formulation.  Mild and severe cases In the current study, published in the journal Science, the researchers tested REGN-COV2 in rhesus macaques, which manifest mild COVID-19 symptoms, and in golden hamsters, which show symptoms that are much more severe, including rapid weight loss. They found that when the cocktail was administered three days before challenging the macaques with the virus, the treatment almost completely blocked establishment of infection. According to the scientists, this ability of REGN-COV2 “matches or exceeds the effects recently shown in vaccine efficacy studies using the same animal models.” “These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of (this approach) to both protect from and treat SARS-CoV-2 disease,” the researchers noted in the study.  Macaques and hamsters When the macaques were treated with the drug one day after infection, they said there was faster viral clearance than in controls who had not been treated with the cocktail.  In the hamster model, the study noted that the animals treated with the drug two days before infection exhibited a “dramatic protection from weight loss,” and decreased viral load in the lungs. The scientists also reported benefits for hamsters treated one day after infection, as compared to controls. “In conclusion, our data provide evidence that REGN-COV2 based therapy may offer clinical benefit in both prevention and treatment settings of COVID-19 disease, where it is currently being evaluated,” they wrote in the study.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/study-says-antibody-cocktail-may-protect-against-covid-19/article32824846.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||In the eyes of a fruit fly||How do humans perceive illusory motion in some stationary images? Neuroscientists from Yale University have finally found the answer to why people perceive illusory motion in some stationary images by studying the eyes of fruit flies (Drosophila). They found that fruit flies too perceive motion in stationary images that evoke illusory motion percept in humans ( PNAS, August 2020). They found that illusory motion percept is generated by unbalanced contributions of direction-selective neurons’ responses to stationary edges. In the case of flies, perceiving motion in static images is an artefact of the brain’s strategies for efficiently processing motion in natural scenes. Perceptual tests in humans suggest that our brains may employ similar mechanisms for this illusion. The scientists presented flies with optical illusions and then measured the flies’ behaviour to check if they perceived motion in the optical illusions much the same way as humans do. They found that flies turned their bodies instinctively towards any perceived motion. The direction the flies turned, the scientists found, was the same as that of the motion that humans perceive in the pattern. The perception was abolished when the elementary motion detector neurons T4 and T5 were silenced. They could also manipulate both the magnitude and direction of the fly’s illusory percept by selectively making either T4 or T5 neurons non-functional (silencing). In human volunteers, the scientists were able to manipulate the magnitude and direction of their perception by moving light edges or dark edges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/in-the-eyes-of-a-fruit-fly/article32824837.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||Leading the global fight against hunger||The most devastating conflict of the 20th century, even arguably of all known history, was the Second World War. The war and its aftermath saw large-scale hunger and privation across all of Europe and other parts of the world that the conflict had touched, on a scale hitherto unknown. It was against this backdrop that one of the war's most decorated Allied Generals spoke these words. “The children of today are forming each day the mental concepts, the mental prejudices, the emotions, that are going to rule and govern them through their lifetime; and over at least half of the year, they are hungry. In many instances, in many countries, almost universally, they are going in packs, up and down alleys, they are searching for a garbage heap in which they find all too little of any kind of sustenance that will keep them alive. Every man here who served with me in Europe has witnessed this with his own eyes. How can we expect children, who are reduced almost to an animal-like level of existence, struggling each day for any kind of scrap that will keep them alive, how can we expect them to develop the ideas and the ideals that in the future will bring them to be apostles of peace. They are, by the very nature of the struggle they are carrying on, wedded to the philosophy of force, whatever they get, they get by their own efforts and by scratching in the garbage heap. That cannot go on if we are to have peace.” This was the kernel of a stirring speech made by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1948, to the UN General Assembly. Eisenhower's experience as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, which landed on the beaches of Normandy in 1944 and ultimately oversaw the final phase of the war in western Europe that ended with Germany’s defeat, had given him a unique insight into the deadly privations the devastating conflict had wrought on children in almost every country on the continent. It was this experience that forged his conviction that childhood hunger and peace were incompatible. In 1960, Eisenhower, who was by now into his second term as President of the United States, again focussed an address to the UN on global hunger and proposed that the UN spearhead the creation of a multilateral effort to provide food aid wherever it was needed. “The United States is already carrying out substantial programmes to make its surpluses available to countries of greatest need. My country is also ready to join with other members of the UN in devising a workable scheme to provide food to member states through the UN system, relying on the advice and assistance of the Food and Agriculture Organization,” he told the UN General Assembly. This proposal was then brought to fruition in 1961, when another American Second World War veteran, George McGovern, led the efforts of President John F. Kennedy's administration at the UN to help establish the World Food Programme (WFP) — the winner this month of the Nobel Peace Prize. Within months of its creation, in September 1962, the WFP faced its first test. A deadly earthquake in northern Iran had claimed the lives of more than 12,000 people and rendered tens of thousands homeless and desperate for succour. The UN’s infant agency flew in 1,500 tonnes of wheat, 270 tonnes of sugar and 27 tonnes of tea, marking its baptism. By 1965, the experimental agency with an initial mandate of three years had proved its worth to the world after responding to multiple crises and was enshrined as a fully fledged UN programme: it is to last for “as long as multilateral food aid is found feasible and desirable”. Largest operation The next two decades saw the organisation facing some of its sternest tests in terms of the scale of humanitarian crises it had to address. From the famines in the Sahel in northern Africa in the 1970s to the famine in Ethiopia in 1984 and the conflict in southern Sudan in the late 1980s, the WFP learnt to marshal resources as varied as camel caravans and flotilla of cargo planes provided by national air forces. “In 1989, Operation Lifeline Sudan is launched: leading a consortium of UN agencies and charities alongside UNICEF, WFP releases 1.5 million tonnes of food into the skies above what has since become South Sudan. The dawn-to-dusk, 20-aircraft, three-sorties-a-day airdrop remains, to this day, the largest in history. It saved hundreds of thousands of lives,” the WFP says on its website. In the six decades since its founding, the WFP has now grown to become the world’s largest humanitarian agency, providing aid to almost 100 million people in more than 80 countries. Commanding one of the biggest non-military and non-commercial logistics operations worldwide, the Rome-headquartered agency on any given day has up to 5,600 trucks, 30 ships and almost 100 aircraft engaged in delivering food and other assistance to those needing aid as well as developmental support, including in some of remotest and often conflict-stricken parts of the globe. The organisation has widened its operational remit and is now a leading provider of not just emergency food aid but also an agency engaged in supporting the nutritional requirements of communities through food assistance programmes. These vary from supporting school meals projects in different countries, including India, to the provision of cash and vouchers as a complement to in-kind food distributions. While theatres of conflict remain the largest areas of widespread deprivation and hunger, the WFP’s interventions have been witnessed in the wake of multiple natural disasters: the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and closer home Nepal’s devastating temblor five years ago. The organisation has also honed its response capabilities to the point where it is able to serve as the frontline telecommunications and logistical support provider to all UN agencies and NGOs in any crisis situation — from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to the Nepali earthquake of 2015. Not free from criticism For an agency funded entirely by donors ranging from governments, companies and individuals, the WFP has had to face its share of criticism. These range from charges that the aid it provides encourages corruption among local politicians and officials, who often sell the food supplies in the black market hurting local farmers and traders, to complaints that it destabilises whatever rudimentary market conditions that may be prevailing by making it hard for small local producers to compete. But with conflicts still raging from Syria to Yemen and Afghanistan, communities threatened by climate change and the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic pushing millions more to the brink of starvation, as the WFP’s executive director David Beasley says in a statement acknowledging the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize: “Every one of the 690 million hungry people in the world today has the right to live peacefully and without hunger. Without peace, we cannot achieve our global goal of zero hunger; and while there is hunger, we will never have a peaceful world.”  In Focus In 1961, the Kennedy administration of the U.S. led the efforts at the UN to establish the World Food Programme  By 1965, the agency, with an initial mandate of three years, had proved its worth to the world after responding to multiple crises and was enshrined as a fully fledged UN programme  The Rome-headquartered agency, on any given day, has up to 5,600 trucks, 30 ships and 100 aircraft engaged in delivering food and other assistance to those in need    In the six decades since its founding, the WFP has grown to become the world’s largest humanitarian agency, providing aid to almost 100 million people in more than 80 countries||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/leading-the-global-fight-against-hunger/article32824834.ece
13 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Genetic scissors’ and rewriting the code of life||The story so far : The 2020 Nobel Prizes for sciences announced this week made history of sorts when one of it was exclusively shared by two women. Scientists Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier bagged the Nobel Prize for Chemistry “for the development of a method for genome editing”. The discovery of “one of gene technology’s sharpest tools: the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic scissors” will lead to the emergence of novel biological applications by making it easier to edit genes, and “may make the dream of curing inherited diseases come true”. What is CRISPR/Cas9? Much like what Microsoft (MS) Word does for writing, the CRISPR/Cas9 system allows for adding, altering and deleting the genomic code in living beings. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) are pieces of DNA that bacteria snip off from viruses that once attacked them, much like file names used to store various documents we write in MS Word.  Podcast:    The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore the importance of ‘memory cells’, which can quickly produce relevant antibodies to neutralise a repeat infection by a virus. Similarly, the CRISPR are a part of bacteria’s immunological systems that help them in recognising threatening viruses. When they sense a lurking virus, the bacteria produce customised RNA, which is necessary to translate DNA into protein, gleaned from the CRISPR libraries. This also contains Cas (CRISPR-associated) genes that are used to produce enzymes such as Cas-9. These enzymes — the Cas-9 being a particularly popular one — can be used to chop the DNA of the virus and destroy them. How can this be used to edit genomes? Using the tool, researchers can change the DNA of animals, plants and microorganisms with precision. Emmanuelle Charpentier, who is now director, Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Berlin, had studied Streptococcus pyogenes , a species of bacteria known to be associated with a range of illnesses such as pharyngitis, tonsillitis and scarlet fever. While studying this, she discovered a previously unknown molecule, tracrRNA. Her work showed that tracrRNA is part of bacteria’s ancient immune system, CRISPR/Cas , that disarms viruses by cleaving their DNA, the Nobel release explains. Dr. Charpentier published her discovery in 2011. The same year, she initiated a collaboration with biochemist Jennifer Doudna, now a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. “Together, they succeeded in recreating the bacteria’s genetic scissors in a test tube and simplifying the scissors’ molecular components so they were easier to use,” says an explainer on the Nobel Prizes website on their work. In a significant experiment, they reprogrammed the genetic scissors. “In their natural form, the scissors recognise DNA from viruses, but Charpentier and Doudna proved that they could be controlled so that they can cut any DNA molecule at a predetermined site. Where the DNA is cut it is then easy to rewrite the code of life,” the note adds. How is the tool different from other editing systems? Other genome editing systems like TALENs and Zinc-Finger Nucleases can do similar jobs, but several users consider the Charpentier-Doudna tool more adaptable and easier to use. It is less than a decade since this system gained wide research and commercial interest, but in the past few years, scientists have been able to make precise single-base-pair changes or larger insertions. Coupled with the availability of genome sequences for a growing number of organisms, the technology allows researchers to find out what genes do, move mutations that are identified and associated with disease into systems where they can be studied and tested for treatment, or where they can be tested in combinations with other mutations. The commercial potential of the system is so compelling that within years of its development, there was a battle over the ownership of the intellectual property rights of the CRISPR/Cas9 involving the University of California and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Broad Institute. The essence of this was that Feng Zhang of the Broad Institute had discovered a way to deploy the system in eukaryotic cells (that make up animal cells), whereas Dr. Doudna’s patent application covered the process more generally. Dr. Zhang’s patent was granted before Dr. Doudna’s application. The patent dispute is still ongoing, and both sides claim victory in terms of the commercial application of the patents. The prize to CRISPR/Cas9 may be unusual as it is rare for a method to be announced and conferred a Nobel within a decade of its discovery, but it underlines its game-changing potential. In the last five years, both Dr. Doudna and Dr. Charpentier have been recipients of several important prizes in sciences. To what uses has the CRISPR/Cas9 been deployed so far? Earlier this year, a person with hereditary blindness became the first to have a CRISPR/Cas-9-based therapy directly injected into her body. Gene-editing company CRISPR Therapeutics announced in June that two patients with beta thalassemia and one with sickle cell disease would no longer require blood transfusions after their bone marrow stem cells were edited using CRISPR techniques. Earlier this week, according to a report in Chemistry World, Dr. Doudna launched a new company, Scribe Therapeutics, to begin work on treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Reuters reported that Dr. Doudna is already employing CRISPR in the battle against the COVID-19 as a co-founder of biotech startup Mammoth, which has tied up with GlaxoSmithKline to develop a test to detect infections. This year, the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) in Delhi developed a COVID-19 testing kit, nicknamed ‘Feluda’, after the fictional Bengali detective, based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system. There are commercial CRISPR-based home kits that allow amateur researchers to develop their own biotechnology applications, triggering a sub-culture called ‘bio-hacking’. Research is already underway for using proteins that are smaller and more efficient than Cas-9, though the system purportedly holds promise for treating more complex diseases, such as cancer, heart diseases, mental illnesses, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Is there a possibility of the tool being misused? The most controversial application of CRISPR/Cas9 was in 2018, when Chinese researcher He Jiankui announced that he had used it to create ‘gene-edited twins’ Lula and Nana via in-vitro fertilisation. He used the gene scissors on the children when they were embryos to edit a gene, CCR5, that in its modified form would ostensibly protect the babies from HIV. The HIV uses the CCR5 to infect cells and the modified gene would shut the door against such an entry. He was widely condemned and sentenced to three years in jail, and stripped of his position at Shenzhen University, where he worked. While he broke a number of medical rules, what is particularly controversial is that the specific mutations that would supposedly protect the children from HIV were not achieved. There were a host of other unintended mutations too. It is not known how these mutations are going to play out over the children's lifetimes and whether they will spread to humanity more widely in due course. Thus, even though the CRISPR/Cas-9 system allows a democratic usage in labs across the world to tinker with genomes, it still has not reached the level of precision required to be sure that it does not cause unintentional side effects. How often have women been awarded Nobel Prizes? This year has seen a remarkable representation of women. Four women have been named Nobel Laureates in 2020 against five men so far. The Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden’s national bank) Prize for economics, or the 'economics Nobel', will be announced next week. The 2001-2019 interval has seen the maximum number of women Laureates — 24 — compared to just 11 from 1981 to 2000 and 7 from 1961 to 1980. There were only 12 women Laureates from 1901 to 1960. Only one woman, Marie Curie, has been honoured twice, with the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics and the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. “Many women think that no matter what they do, their work will never be recognized the way it would be if they were a man,” Al Jazeera quoted Dr. Doudna as saying. “And I think (this prize) refutes that. It makes a strong statement that women can do science, women can do chemistry, and that great science is recognized and honoured.”  The Charpentier-Doudna CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool is considered by several users to be more adaptable and easier to use and ‘may make the dream of curing inherited diseases come true’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/genetic-scissors-and-rewriting-the-code-of-life/article32824769.ece
11 October 2020||New Delhi,||Delhi’s air quality likely to improve today: SAFAR||Delhi’s air quality continued to be in the ‘poor’ category on Saturday after it dropped to such level on Wednesday for the first time in over three months. However, it is expected to marginally improve to the reach the ‘moderate’ category on Sunday, said government-run monitoring agency System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). “The air quality index [AQI] is forecast to marginally improve to ‘moderate’ category for tomorrow. It is exepcted to further improve by Monday, but will remain in the ‘moderate’ category,” SAFAR said. The agency also said that a shift in surface wind direction is forecast in Delhi from northwesterly to southeasterly by Monday and this could have a positive influence on the air quality during the week. Northwesterly winds bring in pollution from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana to the city. The AQI in Delhi was 221 on Saturday, slightly up from 202 on Friday, as per Central Pollution Control Board data. Meanwhile, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee on Saturday imposed a fine of Rs. 20 lakh on a demolition site of Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry in Tansen Marg for violating dust pollution control norms, as per an official order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhis-air-quality-likely-to-improve-today-safar/article32825115.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||The party can’t go on||Wednesday’s landmark guilty verdict against Greece’s far-right Golden Dawn party draws a line under the country’s violent ultra-nationalist surge in the aftermath of its sovereign banking and debt crises. In a case that has been compared to the Nuremberg trials to investigate the Nazi Holocaust, a three- member tribunal ruled that while the party’s several former Members of Parliament, including the founder Nikolaos Michaloliakos, ran a criminal organisation, others were culpable of involvement in various brutalities. Among the guilty is a Golden Dawn supporter who murdered a hip-hop singer in September 2013, those who attacked trade union members affiliated to the Communist Party the same year and hooligans who assaulted Egyptian fishermen in 2012. In all, 68 defendants and 200 witnesses were involved in four cases in a trial that lasted five years. Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has hailed the verdict as a victory for democracy in the country. Mr. Michaloliakos, a former special forces commando in the Greek Army, launched the neo-Nazi party in the 1980s. A known Holocaust denier and admirer of Hitler, he has described Golden Dawn as a party of patriotic nationalists. By the time of Mr. Michaloliakos’s 2010 election to the Athens city council, his black-clad party cadres, the Swasthika-like party emblem and torch-lit parades had gained notoriety for taunting and even physically targeting trade union activists and migrant workers in the capital’s working class suburbs. Their hate-mongering was on vivid display even as Greek society was convulsed by crippling austerity and high unemployment. The Mayor of Athens who tried to block the party’s food distribution and blood bank programmes exclusively for native Greeks was punched by one of the MPs. Another slapped a woman legislator in the house, and a third attacked a female panellist in a television show. When the government was debating a new anti-racism law, Golden Dawn countered the proposal with a draft Bill to ban racism against the Greeks. The party was catapulted into the national Parliament in 2012, when it polled 7% of the vote and garnered 18 seats to emerge the third largest in the 300-strong legislature. Its meteoric rise from a few thousand ballots in the previous elections was a direct consequence of the erosion of public trust in mainstream politics, three decades after the end of military dictatorship in Greece. The severe economic strictures that Athens submitted to in return for the EU’s three bailout packages served as a fertile ground for the party to peddle its polarising propaganda, pitting the poor and the pensioners against the influx of immigrants.  Murder of a musician The September 2013 murder of Pavlos Fyssas, a highly popular hip-hop musician and anti-racism campaigner, marked the brutal climax of Golden Dawn’s violent track record. Even as the incident drew nationwide outrage and demands for the party to be outlawed, its infiltration into the police machinery forced the investigation into the crime to be transferred to the anti-terror unit. The subsequent months saw a number of Golden Dawn MPs being stripped of their parliamentary immunity from prosecution to face charges of involvement in racial attacks and belonging to a criminal group. The party’s participation in the 2014 European parliamentary elections was, however, cleared by the Supreme Court since the charges were yet to be proved. The dip in poll ratings following the murder of Fyssas was but short-lived. In the January 2015 election, Golden Dawn retained almost all of its seats. Significantly, the party failed in last year’s polls to secure the minimum 3% vote threshold to gain entry into the legislature. Notwithstanding these reverses and Wednesday’s ruling, it would be premature to downplay the potency of the party. It is the raison d’etre of the far-right anywhere to tap into popular disaffection with the government over the conditions of living and fuel divisions of race, religion, nationality and all other conceivable social cleavages. Europe’s far-right has demonstrated a capacity to mobilise across countries. The singular focus of the judicial trial on holding Golden Dawn accountable for the brutalities, as distinct from the party’s narrow nationalist ideology, to counter the party perhaps holds wider significance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-party-cant-go-on/article32824830.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||The revenge against circumstance||After several years of polarising the globe with its choice for the Literature Nobel, the Swedish Academy gave the 2020 Prize to contemporary American poet Louise Glück “for her unmistakable poetic voice that with austere beauty makes individual existence universal”. But such is the state of the world, divided over race, caste, creed, class, that Ms. Glück’s first thoughts on winning was that she was astonished. Then, which Nobel winner isn’t? Her surprise was directed elsewhere, “completely flabbergasted that they would choose a white American lyric poet,” she told The New York Times . And yet the 77-year-old Ms. Glück (pronounced Glick) is a celebrated poet in America. She has written 12 collections of poetry and essay volumes. Her work is often compared to poets like Emily Dickinson and Sylvia Plath. She has won all the top awards, from the Pulitzer Prize in 1993 for The Wild Iris to the National Book Award in 2014 for Faithful and Virtuous Night , and was anointed Poet Laureate in 2003. Her poems are spare. She often looks at life’s euphoria and struggles — love, loss, relationships, betrayal, death — through the prism of the past, especially the Greek myths. Ms. Glück had a difficult adolescence, often “at war with my mom” as she has said in interviews; struggled with anorexia, but even through the darkness she wanted to write. In ‘Persephone the Wanderer’ ( Averno ), she examines the mother-daughter relationship — “In the first version, Persephone/is taken from her mother/and the goddess of the earth/punishes the earth — this is consistent with what we know of human behaviour,/that human beings take profound satisfaction/in doing harm, particularly unconscious harm:/we may call this/negative creation.” Anders Olsson, chairman of the Nobel Committee, heard in her poetry, the voices of Dido, Persephone and Eurydice – the abandoned, the punished, the betrayed. They, he noted, were masks for a self in transformation, valid both personally and universally. In her 2012 interview to the American Academy of Achievement, Ms. Glück said she began writing from an early age and was moved by William Blake (especially The Little Black Boy ). Her first published collection was Firstborn (1968), which was acclaimed by critics. Talking about the process, Ms. Glück said she “feels alive” when she writes poetry. For her, writing is a kind of “revenge against circumstance – bad luck, loss, pain…” Witness to intimacy Ms. Glück has another vocation, explains Joanne Feit Diehl in her introduction to On Louise Glück: Change What you See . “She writes poems that bear witness to intimate occasions — subtle psychological moments captured by the austerity of her diction.” Like in ‘Parados’ ( Poems 1962-2012 ): “I’ll tell you/ what I meant to be.../a device that listened…/Not inert: still./ A piece of wood. A stone….I was born to a vocation/To bear witness/To the great mysteries./Now that I have seen both/ birth and death, I know/to the dark nature these/ are proofs, not /mysteries...” A teacher of English at Yale University, Ms. Glück has said that from poet Stanley Kunitz, she learnt to subordinate her ego to the needs of the poem. Collections like The Triumph of Achilles (1985) and Ararat (1990), where three characteristics which recur in her writing unite, were mentioned in the Nobel statement. “The topic of family life; austere intelligence; and a refined sense of composition” find echo in the poems, understandably endearing her to both readers and critics. Her new book, Winter Recipes from the Collective , is due for release next year. Erica McAlpine, associate professor of English at Britain’s Oxford University, told Reuters that the occasional “bleakness” of Ms. Glück’s voice speaks especially well to the “present moment”. For Ms. Glück, as she said in her interview to NYT , “the hope is that if you live through it, there will be art on the other side”. There is an awakening after darkness, she appears to say in ‘Snowdrops’ ( The Wild Iris ): “I did not expect to survive,/earth suppressing me. I didn’t expect/to waken again, to feel/in damp earth my body/able to respond again, remembering/after so long how to open again/in the cold light/of earliest spring – /afraid, yes, but among you again/crying yes risk joy/in the raw wind of the new world.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-revenge-against-circumstance/article32824832.ece
11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||The seminal discovery of the Hepatitis C virus||The story so far: This year’s Nobel Prize for Medicine has been awarded to Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice for their discovery of the Hepatitis C virus. The Nobel announcement said the Prize had been given to “three scientists who have made a decisive contribution to the fight against blood-borne hepatitis, a major global health problem that causes cirrhosis and liver cancer in people around the world”. Why is the finding crucial? Hepatitis (Greek for liver inflammation) is a disease characterised by ‘poor appetite, vomiting, fatigue and jaundice, including yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes. Chronic hepatitis leads to liver damage, which may progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer’. The Nobel release elaborately explains that “viral infection is the leading cause of hepatitis, with some forms persisting without symptoms for many years before life-threatening complications develop”. It is said the first description of hepatitis was recorded around 400 BC by the Greek physician Hippocrates. “Infectious hepatitis may be caused by five different types of RNA or DNA viruses that are the most common cause of hepatitis worldwide,” notes the Nobel communique. Hepatitis A spreads through contaminated food and water, and through direct contact with an infected person, including some sexual activity. Until the 1960s, exposure to blood from infected individuals was a major health hazard, with up to 30% risk of contracting chronic hepatitis following surgery or multiple blood transfusions. It was Nobel laureateBaruch Blumberg, a geneticist working at the United States’ National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, who discovered the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and made way for almost everything that followed in the hepatic virology field. This year’s laureate, Harvey Alter, worked with Blumberg in the lab during this phase. But even the identification and classification of the HBV, and the eventual elimination of HBV-contaminated blood through testing, only partially reduced the risk of getting hepatitis from blood. Clearly, the HBV was only a part of the riddle. Efforts were renewed to identify the missing pieces. It was also imperative that efforts be channelled in this direction as the different types of viral hepatitis contribute substantially to the global burden of hepatic diseases. According to the WHO Global Hepatitis Report, 2017, “Viral hepatitis caused 1.34 million deaths in 2015, a number comparable to deaths caused by tuberculosis, and higher than those caused by the HIV.” However, the number of deaths due to viral hepatitis is increasing over time, while mortality caused by tuberculosis and HIV is declining. “Most viral hepatitis deaths in 2015 were due to chronic liver disease (720,000 deaths due to cirrhosis) and primary liver cancer (470,000 deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma). Globally, in 2015, an estimated 257 million people were living with chronic HBV infection, and 71 million people with chronic HCV [Hepatitis C virus] infection … The epidemic caused by the HCV affects all regions, with major differences between and within countries. The WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region and the European Region have the highest-reported prevalence of HCV,” the report states. How was the unknown factor traced? Back at the lab, a working name was assigned to this still unknown causative factor, “non-A, non-B hepatitis” (NANBH). As the Nobel backgrounder explained, it was clear that the agent causing NANBH was responsible for an alarming number of post-transfusion hepatitis cases, and the situation was frightening, because most infected carriers showed no clinical symptoms. The work of Dr. Alter and Dr. Houghton established a critical link between the NANBH and the HCV infection. Thereafter, the work of Charles Rice provided conclusive evidence that HCV alone could cause transfusion-mediated hepatitis, persist for a long time, and stimulate a specific antibody response — all features of the human infection. Why is this award important? The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutetlauded the discovery of the Hepatitis C virus as a ‘landmark achievement in the ongoing battle against viral diseases’. The significance of choosing the work done by virologists and geneticists, at a time when others are sweating it out trying to decode the SARS-CoV-2 virus, cannot be missed. The Nobel’s recognition of pioneering work in this field is likely to be a boost to researchers whose battle with the COVID-19 virus has probably been as challenging as the decoding of the causative factors for hepatitis. Interestingly,Science, an academic journal, notes that till 2015, 106 Nobel prizes in Physiology or Medicine had been awarded to 210 laureates, and only 33 of these prizes were related to the realm of infectious diseases,clinical microbiology, and immunology. What more needs to be done in the field? Once the puzzle was cracked, screening methods were developed that have now dramatically reduced the risk of acquiring hepatitis from contaminated blood. Effective antiviral drugs have also become available, the Nobel acknwoledgement states. In 2016, the World Health Assembly endorsed the Global Health Sector Strategy (GHSS) on viral hepatitis 2016–2021, calling for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030. Ensuring access to affordable testing and to viral therapeutics that will improve the quality of life and reduce deaths due to hepatitis should be the priority of governments, the WHO Global Hepatitis Report advises.  The Nobel announcement said the discovery of the Hepatitis C virus is a ‘landmark achievement in the ongoing battle against viral diseases’. The recognition of pioneering work in this field is likely to boost research on COVID-19||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-seminal-discovery-of-the-hepatitis-c-virus/article32824767.ece
11 October 2020||JAIPUR,||Gehlot may call Assembly meet on farm laws||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday hinted at convening a special session of the Assembly soon to discuss the impact of farm Acts and protect the interests of farmers by examining the laws for amendments. He said the House would deliberate on the constitutional power of States to legislate on agriculture. “We will hold a debate on the Centre’s interference in the legislative domain of States and see what rights the Assembly has. We are examining all possibilities after the Presidential assent... Every possible action will be taken to extend relief to farmers,” Mr. Gehlot said at a convention organised by the Congress against the farm laws here. ‘Black legislations’ Mr. Gehlot questioned the intent of the BJP government at the Centre behind bringing the “black legislations” during the pandemic. The bills were tabled without any discussion with the State governments and other stakeholders and passed in a “questionable manner”, he said. He said Rajasthan had a robust network of Krishi Upaj Mandis for supporting the small and marginal farmers, which would be demolished by the new statutes. The contract farming at small land holdings and the absence of minimum support prices would destroy agriculturists and deprive all the connected people of their livelihood, he added. A large number of representatives of farmers’ organisations, which have a launched a campaign against these Acts, attended the convention. Agriculture Minister Lal Chand Kataria, Minister of State for Technical Education Subhash Garg and Pradesh Congress Committee president Govind Singh Dotasra also addressed the gathering. Mr. Dotasra said the farmers in the State would expose the designs of the Centre and the Congress workers would carry out a signature campaign against the farm laws. A memorandum with these signatures will later be submitted to President Ram Nath Kovind.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/gehlot-may-call-assembly-meet-on-farm-laws/article32825128.ece
11 October 2020||SONIPAT,||Helping girls at risk of dropping out||Panic-stricken Gauri, a student of Class IX who doesn’t use a surname, recorded a quick audio message to alert a community worker that her father had forbidden her from using a mobile phone to access pre-recorded school lectures. Two months after the incident, the local administration had earlier this week launched a toll-free helpline in her district Sonipat in Haryana, in collaboration with NGOs Breakthrough and Samarthya, to reach out to students like her who are at risk of dropping out. Fourteen-year-old Gauri’s classmates remember her as a hard-working student who attended school despite sickness or heavy rain. She is also known to take keen interest in both dancing as well as martial arts. Today, her friends in Rewli village are unaware of her whereabouts. Fear of misuse Her father, 46-year-old Radhey Shyam, says she has been sent to her elder sister’s marital home to help her with household chores. “Phones can be easily misused. Children will use them to talk rather than study. It is an issue when your children are growing up, more so when they are girls because it becomes a question of their honour,” the family patriarch explains in a telephonic conversation. The COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a nationwide lockdown, forced schools to shut down. When restrictions began to be eased, classes moved online. With the Union Ministry of Human Resource and Development issuing guidelines for schools to re-open from October 15, Haryana plans to ask students from Class 9 to 12 to return to schools while others will continue to take video lessons, explains District Education Officer Joginder Hooda, who launched the helpline. The toll-free helpline (1800180135) aims to provide counselling to children with mental health problems due to COVID-19, lend an ear to those unable to cope with academic challenges, counsel parents threatening to deny access to school education due to gender bias and extend career guidance. It will also help parents who are migrants from States like U.P. and Bihar apply for admissions for their children after their families were displaced during the lockdown. Five resource persons will operate the helpline, who will then put callers in touch with a counsellor from a pool of 60 psychologists, psychiatrists, NCERT- and CBSE-certified career and academic counsellors. Various school principals in the district will be responsible for disseminating information about the new helpline among students through WhatsApp groups. Child marriage “Dropping out of school or school closures for long period have the potential of exacerbating cases of early marriage. Since families treat school expenditure on girls as a liability, when schools are shut, parents think marriage is the best possible solution. Statistics show that if girls are in school, the chances of marriage become much less and the longer they are in education, the longer they are able to delay marriage. If they can stay longer in education, their aspiration for themselves change, they are more self-aware,” explains Sohini Bhattacharya, CEO, Breakthrough India. Past experiences of natural disasters and crises have shown how disruption in schools results in an increase in child marriage. During the 2004 tsunami, girls in Indonesia, India and Sri Lanka were forced into marriage with tsunami widowers. School closures during 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak and 2015 earthquake in Nepal too resulted in a spurt in child marriages. Up to 2.5 million additional girls are expected to marry as a result of the economic impacts of the pandemic. This is in addition to the 58.4 million child marriages that take place every five years. Online classes have proved to be very challenging for most students in Rewli village where power cuts are common, internet data unaffordable for families with limited means and access to phones is limited, especially in families where there are three to four school-going siblings. Add to this, the challenges that are unique to girls. Fifteen-year-old Priyanka Sahni is able to spend only one hour studying at home during her 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. ‘school hours’. “Because I am now at home, my mother asks me to help with domestic chores.” A demand never made of her brothers. Her household responsibilities have more than doubled as she has to sweep the house clean and wash utensils, in addition to helping her mother in the kitchen, which she also used to do before the lockdown. Her classmate, Kajal Kanaujia, complains that she even has to do the heavy lifting at home such as fetching water, though her brother is the one with perks like owning a phone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/helping-girls-at-risk-of-dropping-out/article32825130.ece
11 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Graveyard staff pay for infected man’s burial||In a heart-warming gesture, an unidentified man who was found in a semi-conscious state in Okhla in September and later died of COVID-19 was given a burial at a graveyard by its two staffers. Mohammed Shamim, a third-generation gravedigger at Delhi Gate’s Jadid Qabristan Ahle Islam, said he got a call from an AIIMS doctor seeking help to bury an unidentified man who had died of the deadly disease. “The deceased was a Muslim. If we had not agreed, then he would have been cremated. The man deserved a respectable burial,” said Mr. Shamim, who spent around Rs. 2,000 on the arrangements. On the afternoon of October 8, the body was brought to the graveyard by a police official and laid to rest. A senior police officer said that on September 15, information was received at Okhla Industrial Area about a person, identified as Ajgar, being admitted at AIIMS Trauma Centre. “In his medicolegal certificate, the doctor mentioned that he was suffering from Tuberculosis,” the officer said. On September 20, the man was shifted to Rajan Babu TB Hospital at Kingsway Camp for treatment. “At the hospital, he was in a semi-conscious state and said his name was Ajgar and he was a resident of Uttar Pradesh’s Bijoli village,” the officer said. A police official contacted counterparts in Bijoli and shared the man’s photograph, but he was allegedly told that no such person resides there. On September 25, Ajgar passed away and his body was shifted back to AIIMS for postmortem. A COVID-19 test was conducted and he was found positive for the virus. “The body was not handed over to the police as he was infected,” the officer added. Finally, 13 days after his death, the unidentified man was buried at the graveyard. Probe initiated The police said that inquest proceedings have been initiated and personnel are being sent to Bijoli for physical verification to gather information about the deceased. Mr. Shamim said that since the outbreak of COVID-19, they had buried six-seven persons whose families were never traced. The number of bodies coming in had has reduced to about one in two days, but for the last 15-20 days, we are burying three-four persons a day again, he added.  The deceased was a Muslim. If we had not agreed, then he would have been cremated.

11 October 2020||October 11 2020 00:00 IST,||The Milky Way’s secret||The story so far: The Nobel Prize for Physics, announced on October 6, was shared by three laureates. One half went to Roger Penrose, now at the University of Oxford, for ‘the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity’. The other half is shared by Reinhard Genzel of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, Garching, Germany, and Andrea M. Ghez of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), for ‘the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy’. A statement from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which selects the awardees for the Prize, said the three laureates were awarded “for their discoveries about one of the most exotic phenomena in the universe, the black hole”. What is the early history of the black hole? Over a hundred years before Albert Einstein published his theory of relativity, John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace had speculated that extremely dense stars could have such high gravity that not even light could escape them. These would become invisible (dark stars). This idea came back to life in 1916, when just a few weeks after Einstein had published his theory of relativity, German astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found a solution to these equations, having a feature that was later named ‘event horizon’ — the point of no return, beyond which even light, the fastest object in the world, cannot escape. However, these concepts and their implications were so bizarre then that even Einstein refused to believe that it was possible. An Indian researcher, B. Datt, and independently, Robert Oppenheimer and Hartland Snyder, made the first calculations of the gravitational collapse of a star in the 1930s. However, they had made the simplifying assumption of spherical symmetry. By the early 1960s, observations of ‘quasars’, which are now called active galactic nuclei, were preparing the ground for the eventual observational evidence for supermassive blackholes. What were the key questions when Dr. Penrose came into the picture? The scenario of a spherically symmetric massive star collapsing under its own gravity until it falls below the Schwarzschild radius (event horizon) to form an infinitely dense singularity had been described independently by Datt and Oppenheimer and Snyder. “This was, however, conditional on the high degree of symmetry [spherical symmetry], which almost certainly does not hold for realistic astrophysical collapse,” says Prof. Ghanashyam Date, Chennai Mathematical Institute. The question was: would a complete gravitational collapse happen without spherical symmetry? What was Dr. Penrose’s achievement? Prof. Date sums it up thus: while more solutions of the Einstein equation were found, suggesting blackholes hiding singularities, they all had special symmetries and their realisation under generic astrophysical conditions was in doubt. Dr. Penrose, through his singularity theorems, conceptualised the formation of ‘trapped surfaces’ as the condition for formation of black holes in a generic manner. He made it possible for the world of physics to accept that black holes can and will form in the universe, as described by Einstein’s field equations. How did observations of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way begin? American astronomer Harlow Shapley, about a hundred years ago, was the first person to identify the centre of the galaxy. By the 1960s, we learnt that there was a source of radio waves sitting there. This was named ‘Sagittarius A*’, and it is approximately 26,000 light years away, i.e., light from this point would take 26,000 years to reach us. In comparison, light from the Sun takes approximately eight minutes to reach the Earth. In the 1990s, larger telescope facilities became available and Dr. Ghez started a research programme from the Keck Observatory atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Dr. Genzel’s group first used the New Technology Telescope in La Silla, Chile, and later moved to the Very Large Telescope on the Cerro Paranal mountain in Chile. How did they determine that there was a black hole? All the stars in the Milky Way orbit the centre. For example, the Sun orbits Sagittarius A* in more than 200 million years. For nearly three decades, the groups observed some thirty stars, particularly one that was named S2 by one group and S02 by the other. They found that the stars move in perfect elliptical orbits, just as if the object about which they were orbiting (Sagittarius A*) is a concentrated mass [compact object] and not diffused or scattered. Given its calculated mass of about four million solar masses, and its invisibility, this could only be a supermassive black hole, they deduced. Dr. Ghez is the fourth woman to receive the Physics Nobel. Who are the other three? Since 1901, a total of 114 physics Nobel prizes have been awarded. Before Dr. Ghez, only three had gone to women: Marie Curie (1903, for radiation phenomena), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963, nuclear shell structure), Donna Strickland (2018, ultrashort, high-intensity laser pulses).   While Roger Penrose discovered that black holes can and will form as described by Einstein’s field equations, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez found a supermassive object at the centre of our galaxy||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-milky-ways-secret/article32824765.ece
11 October 2020||New Delhi,||Sisodia reviews content of ‘Deshbhakti’ curriculum||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia reviewed the content of the ‘Deshbhakti’ curriculum and chaired the third joint review meeting of a new board in addition to the new curriculum committee to take stock of the progress so far here on Saturday. The work on introducing the Deshbhakti curriculum started last year after an announcement by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and it is in the final stages of preparation, the government said in a statement. According to the government, the Curriculum and Board committees were constituted this July to recommend new curriculum for children up to the age of 14 and setting up of Delhi Examination Board. Both the committees are likely to submit their recommendations by mid-November. “Assessment would be the basis of Deshbhakti curriculum. Understanding of the teacher as to where a child stands today and subsequently issues like inclusiveness, gender, different forms of discrimination, integrity, care for public property and natural resources, etc., would be the key to enable a child to become a true Deshbhakt,” Mr. Sisodia stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sisodia-reviews-content-of-deshbhakti-curriculum/article32825122.ece
11 October 2020||Guwahati,||Assam to submit report on ST status by Oct. 30||Assam’s Group of Ministers has set October 30 as the deadline for submitting to the Centre its final report on granting Scheduled Tribe (ST) status to six communities. The six communities are Chutiya, Koch-Rajbongshi, Matak, Moran, Tai-Ahom and ‘Tea Tribe’, some of which are categorised as Other Backward Classes. The State’s tribes are opposed to granting ST status to these communities. The Group of Ministers headed by Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had met the leaders of the six communities. Later, he said “60% of the issues” pertaining to granting ST status had been resolved. “We will submit the report to the Centre on or before October 30,” he said, adding the government would wait for the Centre’s decision for the next step. Dr. Sarma insisted the issue was not linked to the 2021 Assembly election. The government had in January 2019 formed the GoM to recommend the rights and benefits for new STs. The Centre had sought the group after the introduction of the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill in the Parliament.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/assam-to-submit-report-on-st-status-by-oct-30/article32825126.ece

A senior police officer said that the woman named her brother and her uncle as the killers of her friend Rahul Rajput (18), a resident of north-west Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar who was pursuing graduation from DU’s School of Open Learning and also tutored students. “The girl is a witness in the case. She has not asked for protection so far, but if she moves an application, action will be taken,” said an officer privy to probe.  Meanwhile, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday met Rahul’s family and announced an ex-gratia of Rs. 10 lakh. He added that the Delhi government will ensure that the culprits get strict punishment at the earliest by appointing prominent lawyers in the case. The BJP, meanwhile, attacked Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi for remaining silent about the murder. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta met the family of the victim and appealed to the CM to provide Rs. 1 crore compensation to the family. He also demanded that the matter be heard in a fast track court so the culprits are punished at the earliest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/du-student-murder-relative-of-accused-a-witness-now/article32825116.ece
