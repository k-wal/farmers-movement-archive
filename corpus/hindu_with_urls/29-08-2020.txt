29 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||States can apply to UGC for extension of exam deadline: SC||States are empowered under the Disaster Management Act to override the University Grants Commission (UGC) exam guidelines in order to protect human lives amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Supreme Court held on Friday. A three-judge Bench, led by Justice Ashok Bhushan, upheld the power of a State and its disaster management authority to countermand the revised UGC guidelines of July 6 to conduct the final year and terminal semester examinations by September 30. ‘Saving lives paramount’ “In case of a disaster, the priority of all authorities under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 is to immediately combat the disaster and contain it to save human life. Saving of life of human being is given paramount importance,” Justice Bhushan, who authored the 160-page judgment for the Bench, emphasised. But the court held that the powers of the States under the Disaster Management Act do not extend to promoting students on the sole basis of their internal assessment without taking exams. “When the State Disaster Management Authority and State government take a decision that for mitigation or prevention of disaster it is not possible to hold physical examination in the State, the decision is within the four corners of Disaster Management Act, 2005. However, their decision that students should be promoted without appearing in the final year examination is not within the domain of the Act,” the Bench, including Justices R. Subhash Reddy and M.R. Shah, concluded. In future, if any State found it impossible to conduct the exams by September 30 and wanted to postpone them, it could apply to the UGC, which would consider the request and decide at the earliest, the court directed. Justice Bhushan, however, disagreed that the revised UGC guidelines was “unreasonable” and a violation of the right to life of students and examiners. The July 6 guidelines were based on the recommendations of the R.C. Kuhad Expert Committee, the court pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/states-can-apply-to-ugc-for-extension-of-exam-deadline-sc/article32470390.ece

29 August 2020||Kolkata,||Students being pushed to mental agony, says Mamata||Expressing her displeasure over the developments regarding holding final examinations for universities and colleges, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday said students are being pushed into a “terrible mental agony”. She also said there will be no university examinations in the State in September. “I will not blame the Supreme Court. But I want to ask the University Grants Commission (UGC), why are you putting our students through this difficult situation,” Ms. Banerjee said, addressing the student supporters of Trinamool Congress Chattra Parishad during a virtual rally. The CM referred to a communication by UGC on April 29, where the examinations were not mandatory for students. “Many States had already followed UGC’s earlier guidelines and given out results to students. Now I ask the Central government, what will you say to the people?” Ms. Banerjee asked. She also raised issues like trains and flights not operating and asked how the students would reach examination centres. “You do Mann Ki Baat , why don’t you listen to the Mann Ki Baat of the students?” the CM asked referring to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  No exams in Sept. Ms. Banerjee said the State Education Department will consult colleges and universities and take its decision on the issue in the next few days. “There will not be any exam in September; we will try conducting it before Durga Pujo… Those who can give it online, allow them to take it online, those who want to do it offline, do it at a centre near their homes,” she said, adding that the State government will do the “minimum required”. She also said minsters from six States, including West Bengal, had filed a review petition in the Supreme Court on Friday requesting that the National Entrance cum Eligibility Test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) be postponed. A number of teachers bodies including All India Save Education Committee have opposed the move of UGC and Union government to hold examinations. Bharatiya Janata Party's state unit president Dilip Ghosh said the Chief Minister was indulging in “negative politics” and trying to “shirk her responsibility” by opposing the examinations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/students-being-pushed-to-mental-agony-says-mamata/article32470771.ece

29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Tirumala Brahmotsavams to be confined to inner precincts of temple||The annual Brahmotsavams of Lord Venkateswara scheduled to commence from September 19 will be conducted in ‘ekantham’ (private). The decision was taken at the TTD board of trustees meeting here on Friday. Briefing the media, TTD Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy said the “rather unpleasant” decision to perform the religious carnival on a low key note was taken in view of the COVID-19 situation. The two-time daily processions of the Lord on various vahanams (carriers) that form the core part of the festival would not be organised, and the festivities would be confined to the inner precincts of the hill temple. The town shall experience two Brahmotsavams this year. Revenue A decision regarding second Brahmotsavams slated from October 16 would will be taken subject to the then prevailing conditions, should the pandemic register a wane. As part of reinforcing its revenue potentiality, the board resolved to effect ameliorations in its cash and gold deposits with various banks in consultation with the State government. Prima facie it has been decided to go for long-term gold deposits that fetch higher rate of interest instead of short term deposits. The board also discussed the feasibility of drawing monthly interest on its cash deposits instead of deriving it quarterly as is the practice. VIP darshan would be extended to Udayasthamana seva grihastas, who could not attend to sevas at the temple owing to COVID-19 restrictions this year. Darshan tickets Even though the board did not arrive at any decision with regard to enhancement in the number of pilgrims allowed for darshan, it, however, gave nod for issuance of 3,000 dharma (free) darshan tickets on a daily basis under the current booking system. The tickets would be issued at TTD counters at Tirupati from Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tirumala-brahmotsavams-to-be-confined-to-inner-precincts-of-temple/article32470333.ece

29 August 2020||Pune,||‘No BJP leader linked Aaditya to actor’s death’||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator and Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Devendra Fadnavis on Friday said no BJP leader had “directly or indirectly” taken State Minister Aaditya Thackeray’s name in connection with the Sushant Singh Rajput case. Speaking to reporters after the inauguration of a COVID-19 facility at Baner, the former chief minister said investigations into the Bollywood actor’s death had thrown up a number of surprising revelations. Mr. Fadnavis wondered why these disclosures had not come to the fore prior to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) taking over the probe. “The CBI took over the investigation 40 days after the unfortunate incident. What if evidence was tampered with during this period? There are media reports that hard-disks have been destroyed. So, the question arises as to whether the Mumbai Police was under any political pressure all this while,” the BJP leader said. While Mr. Fadnavis expressed confidence that the central agency would ultimately get to the bottom of the case, he opined that if only the agency had been involved right from the start, crucial evidence might have been prevented from being totally destroyed. It was Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut who had recently alleged a conspiracy to link Shiv Sena’s Mr. Aaditya, the son of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, with the actor’s death. Without actually naming the BJP, Mr. Raut had said the Opposition could not face up to the fact that the MVA government was in power in Maharashtra. Mr. Aaditya had strongly denied any link with the case while stating that his family was being targeted for no reason. Earlier, Congress leader and spokesperson Sachin Sawant had tweeted a photo of Mr. Fadnavis with film producer Sandip Singh, whose name has figured in the investigation surrounding the actor’s murky death. In the picture, Mr. Fadnavis is seen with actor Vivek Oberoi at the launch of a poster on the biopic on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The film was produced by Mr. Singh. Tweeting this picture, Mr. Sawant sought a probe into the ‘BJP angle’ in the case. Responding to Mr. Sawant’s demand, Mr. Fadnavis said: “Now that Sachin Sawant’s party is part of the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress MVA government, why weren’t these suspects [read Sandip Singh] questioned by the Mumbai police? This same person [Mr. Singh] was also the director or producer of a film on late Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray. This only proves that Sachin Sawant has not done his homework (sic).”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-bjp-leader-linked-aaditya-to-actors-death/article32470836.ece
29 August 2020||Mumbai,||Maharashtra VCs to chalk out plan for final year exams||The Maharashtra government on Friday convened an urgent meeting of vice-chancellors (VCs) of universities in the State to chalk out plans for conducting the final year examinations after the Supreme Court ruled that students cannot be promoted without exams. State Higher and Technical Education Minister Uday Samant said, “We respect the Supreme Court’s decision. We will be discussing with all vice-chancellors how to conduct the exams. We had informed the court that the COVID-19 situation will create problems. The court has still asked us to go ahead with the exams. We will act accordingly.” Mr. Samant said the State was not in favour of conducting the exams considering the safety of around nine lakh students. He said a committee comprising VCs and experts has been formed to prepare a timetable for the exams. The committee has been asked to submit its report in two days. “We will not announce the dates randomly. We will give necessary time for the students to prepare for the exams.” The Yuva Sena approached the court, challenging the University Grants Commission’s (UGC) order to conduct the exams. The court turned down the plea and directed the UGC to fix dates for the exams||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/maharashtra-vcs-to-chalk-out-plan-for-final-year-exams/article32470835.ece
29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Realism should shape India’s China policy’||Getting India’s China policy right will be “critical to India’s prospects” and doing so will require “going beyond traditional assumptions”, says External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in a new book. Indian assessments of China’s rise and of the gap in comprehensive national power “should be objective about its prospects in comparison” but at the same time, “where tested, it is essential to stand one’s ground,” argues Mr. Jaishankar in The India Way , a book that will be released on September 4. Turning point A chapter of the book analyses in detail the twists and turns in the history of India’s relations with China and the road ahead for the relationship, and makes the case for the neighbours to seek an equilibrium as they manage their respective rises. Mr. Jaishankar, a former Foreign Secretary, was India’s longest-serving Ambassador to China for four years, starting 2009. Drawing on his time in China, he describes 2009 as “the turning point in China’s current rise”, when “the combination of a global financial crisis, a change in the U.S. Administration, and the consequences of the Iraq war now no longer made it necessary to hide its light”. He sees China’s 18th Party Congress in 2012, when Xi Jinping came to power, as marking the start of another new era for China’s relations with India and the world. The challenge India now faces, in his view, is “to manage a more powerful neighbour while ensuring its own rise”, and “in doing so, there must be an understanding on our part that this search for equilibrium is an infinite process”. “Some issues may be amenable to an early resolution but others may not,” he writes. “Today, the bottom line for the relationship is clear: peace and tranquillity must prevail on the border if the progress made in the last three decades is not to be jeopardized. The border and the future of ties cannot be separated.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/realism-should-shape-indias-china-policy/article32470383.ece

29 August 2020||New Delhi,||Police, public order, Central cadre under J&K L-G||The Union Home Ministry on Friday notified new rules for administration in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) that specify the functions of the Lieutenant-Governor (L-G) and the Council of Ministers. According to the transaction of business rules, “police, public order, All India Services and anti-corruption” will fall under the executive functions of the L-G, implying that the Chief Minister or the Council of Ministers will have no say in their functioning. The rules notified by Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla say that proposals or matters which affect or are likely to affect peace and tranquillity or the interest of any minority community, the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the Backward Classes “shall essentially be submitted to the Lieutenant Governor through the Chief Secretary, under intimation to the Chief Minister, before issuing any orders”. The Council of Ministers, led by the CM, will decide service matters of non-All India Services officers, proposal to impose new tax, land revenue, sale grant or lease of government property, reconstituting departments or offices and draft legislation. However, in case of difference of opinion between the L-G and a Minister, when no agreement could be reached even after a month, the “decision of the Lieutenant Governor shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Council of Ministers”, the rules note. On August 6, 2019, Parliament read down Article 370 of the Constitution revoking the special status of J&K and bifurcated and downgraded the State into the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh, with the former having a Legislative Assembly. The erstwhile State has been under Central rule since June 2018 and the elected Assembly was dissolved in November the same year. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, while introducing the legislation in Parliament last year, said J&K’s Statehood would be restored soon. J&K has been without a Chief Minister since June 2018. According to the requirements of the J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019, fresh elections will be held after the delimitation exercise is completed next year. The rules state that “any matter which is likely to bring the Government of the Union territory into controversy with the Central Government or with any State Government” shall, as soon as possible, be brought to the notice of the L-G and the CM by the Secretary concerned through the Chief Secretary. 39 departments Under the rules, there will be 39 departments in the UT, such as school education, agriculture, higher education, horticulture, election, general administration, home, mining, power, Public Works Department, tribal affairs and transport. The rules say all communications received from the Centre, including those from the Prime Minister and other Ministers, other than those of a routine or unimportant character, shall, as soon as possible after their receipt, be submitted by the Secretary to the Chief Secretary, the Minister in charge, the Chief Minister and the L-G for information.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/police-public-order-central-cadre-under-jk-l-g/article32470608.ece
29 August 2020||New Delhi,||HC stays airing of show on ‘Muslim conspiracy’||The Delhi High Court on Friday stayed the airing of a show titled ‘Bindas Bol’ that would have aired at 8 p.m. on Friday on Sudarshan News. The show’s trailer claimed Muslims are engaged in a conspiracy to ‘infiltrate’ the civil service. Justice Navin Chawla passed the interim decision after some former and current students of Jamia Millia Islamia approached the court with an urgent petition to stay the airing of the programme. The trailer of the show shared on August 25 by Suresh Chavhanke, Editor-in-Chief of Sudarshan News, has gone viral on social media. During the hearing, the Central government told the High Court that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has received several complaints about the show and a notice has been issued to Sudarshan News. The High Court also issued notices to Sudarshan News and Mr. Chavhanke and posted the case for further hearing on September 7. It ordered the Ministry to decide on the notice issued in the meantime and place its decision before the court.  In the petition, the students claimed Mr. Chavhanke has openly engaged in hate speech and defamation against students of Jamia Millia Islamia and the Muslim community. The petition said the trailer showed Mr. Chavhanke claiming the success of Jamia students in this year’s Civil Services Examination as representing a “conspiracy to infiltrate the civil service by Muslims”. Advocate Shadan Farasat, representing the students, said Mr. Chavhanke has “openly incited his target non-Muslim audience by fearmongering that ‘jihadis’ from Jamia Millia Islamia would soon hold positions of authority and power such as Collector and Secretary”. ‘Hate speech’ The proposed broadcast and trailer also constitute hate speech and criminal defamation and is an offence under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, argued the advocate. Reacting to the trailer, the official Twitter handle of Indian Police Service Association posted on August 27, “A news story targeting candidates in civil services on the basis of religion is being promoted by Sudarshan TV. We condemn the communal and irresponsible piece of journalism.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-stays-airing-of-show-on-muslim-conspiracy/article32470616.ece

29 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||40-year-old man killed for inquiring about missing minor son; 2 arrested||A 40-year-old man looking for his son was allegedly killed by two persons who got “irritated” with him for continuously asking about the boy in south-east Delhi’s Pul Prahladpur, police said on Friday. The accused have been arrested. Deputy Commissioner of Police (South East) R.P. Meena said the accused, brothers Dheeraj and Rakesh Arora, are Gramin Seva drivers. They allegedly hit Jaipur native Krishan Kumar Meena with an iron rod, injuring him fatally. Police said that on Thursday night, patrolling staff on Maa Anand Mai Marg found a pregnant woman crying next to a man [the victim, Krishan] lying in a pool of blood, with locals gathered around them. They rushed the man to hospital but he succumbed to his injuries. When questioned, the woman said she and her husband were looking for their 7-year-old son Rahul who had gone missing a few minutes earlier and that two men hit her husband with a rod. During investigation, a security guard in the area told the police that he saw a man running around the time Krishan was attacked and that the man often used to sleep inside a Gramin Seva vehicle. “Based on the information, a man who was sleeping inside the vehicle was held and later identified as Rakesh,” DCP Meena said. During interrogation, Rakesh revealed the involvement of his brother Dheeraj, who was then arrested. The brothers said they were sitting inside the vehicle and drinking when Krishan came and started asking about his missing son. “He asked the same thing repeatedly, which irritated them. As tempers flared, Dheeraj caught hold of him and Rakesh fished out an iron rod from a Gramin Sewa vehicle parked nearby and hit him on the head. When his wife started shouting for help, both of them ran away,” said the DCP. While Krishan’s search met with a brutal end, his missing son was later found and returned to the distraught mother.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/40-year-old-man-killed-for-inquiring-about-missing-minor-son-2-arrested/article32470609.ece
29 August 2020||Press Trust of India Kolkata,||‘Ensure Question, Zero Hours are not curtailed’||Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Friday wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, expressing his disagreement with a proposal to curtail the Question and Zero Hour during the upcoming Parliament session as it will prevent lawmakers from raising issues of national importance. In a two-page letter to Mr. Birla, the Congress MP urged him to ensure that there is no curtailment of the two important parts of the proceedings. Mr. Chowdhury hailed as “truly appreciable” the efforts being made by the speaker for smooth conduct of the proceedings while keeping in mind the safety of MPs when the House convenes on September 14, amidst the pandemic. “There, however, appears to be a proposal for curtailing the Question and Zero Hour during the session by way of restricting the allocation of time and number of notices that could be filed. You will kindly appreciate the fact that raising questions in Parliament, and issues of public importance during the Zero Hour are foremost of the procedural methods available to vent issues of national and public importance,” Mr. Chowdhury said. He said curtailing them by restricting the issues discussed will therefore, “not be in the interest of the elected representatives”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ensure-question-zero-hours-are-not-curtailed/article32470773.ece

29 August 2020||Kolkata,||Unused spaces at Kolkata’s tram depots to be let out||The West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC) has embarked on a plan to rent out unused spaces at its tram depots across Kolkata to augment income, which has dwindled over the past few months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a senior official said on Friday. The corporation has invited expressions of interest from banks, financial institutions, departmental stores, restaurants, malls, showrooms and others for letting out spaces for commercial purposes at seven tram depots, most of which have sprawling compounds. “The idea is to augment the non-traffic revenue; the rooms or spaces are lying unused and rental income will help generate earnings. The spaces being let out are situated at tram depots of Tollygunge, Gariahat, Nonapukur, Ballygunge terminus, Garia, Behala and Shimultala substation buildings — all conveniently located,” the official said. The available space will be let out initially for a period of nine years, he said, adding that the last date for submission of expression of interest is September 4. Income from ticket sales, which is the main source of revenue for the state transport undertaking, has dwindled owing to curbs on passenger load, and it has been looking for alternative sources of income, the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/unused-spaces-at-kolkatas-tram-depots-to-be-let-out/article32470777.ece

29 August 2020||New Delhi,||Four parties approach SC to defer JEE, NEET||The Congress, Trinamool Congress, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Shiv Sena on Friday filed a review petition in the Supreme Court seeking a deferral of the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) for engineering courses and and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for medical courses. At a press conference after approaching the court, the parties said they were not for cancelling the exams but wanted them deferred till November so that the government could ensure the safety of the students. To ensure safety Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien said the petitioners did not want the students to lose an academic year, and the petition aimed to ensure better safety and security for the students. “The charge here is poor planning; what can one expect from a government which imposed a 21-day lockdown with a mere four-hour notice,” Mr. O’Brien asked. Senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who represented all the six petitioners, said the government needed to keep in mind that together, the petitioners represented 30% of the Indian population. The two examinations were originally scheduled for April and had been postponed because of the extended lockdown. “The government has drawn itself into a corner and was now trying to get out of it by a kneejerk reaction,” he said. Citing Bihar as an example, he said out of 38 districts in the State, there were NEET centres only in two and JEE venues in seven. When the Centre said it had increased the number of centres, only their density had been increased in districts where they already existed, Mr. Singhvi said. As many as 1,400 students were scheduled to appear in one NEET centre. Mr. Singhvi said holding the exams at present was exclusionary for various reasons. With transport facilities disrupted, only the affluent who had private vehicles would be able to travel to the examination centres and children who were affected by COVID-19 would not be able to appear. Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren said the government’s insistence on holding the exams showed its “stubbornness”. “Not a single day goes by when a death due to COVID-19 doesn’t occur. Who will be responsible if any student or their family gets infected because of appearing in the exam,” asked Mr. Soren. He said, ultimately, the States would have to bear the brunt of a unilateral decision taken by the Centre. “I had written to the Union Education Minister urging him to defer the exams, but so far, I haven’t had any response from him,” Mr Soren said.

29 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||India now third in death toll||India’s COVID-19 death toll became the third highest in the world on Friday, surpassing Mexico’s. Cumulative deaths in the country stood at 62,724 on Friday, 130 more than that of Mexico’s recorded toll at that time. India registered over 75,122 new cases on Friday — the third consecutive day with more than 70,000 infections. The 77,266 cases recorded in India on Thursday, according to the Health Ministry, is the highest single-day spike in the world, crossing the 77,255 infections recorded in the U.S. on July 17. Nine lakh tests India has tested more than nine lakh COVID-19 samples for the second consecutive day on Friday, the Ministry said in a release, adding that it was keeping a sharp focus on “test, track and treat” strategy. “India has already created a capacity of doing 10 lakh tests a day and 9,01,338 samples were tested in the last 24 hours,” the release said. It said the cumulative tests were nearing four crore. “The total tests as on date have reached 3,94,77,848. More than one crore samples have been tested in the past two weeks. The tests per million too have seen a sharp surge to 28,607. It is only by aggressive testing that positive cases can be identified at an early stage, their close contacts promptly tracked and isolated as well as timely and effective treatment can be ensured,” the Ministry said. There are 1,564 labs in the country (998 in the government sector and 566 private ones). The Ministry on Friday said it was also ramping up hospital infrastructure through the three-tier dedicated COVID facilities — hospitals with ICU bed, ventilators and so on for critical care management; health centres with oxygen beds and doctor on call; and care centres with isolation beds. The country has 1,723 dedicated hospitals, 3,883 health centres and 11,689 care centres with a total of 15,89,105 isolation beds, 2,17,128 oxygen-supported beds and 57,380 ICU beds. “The Centre has adopted a graded and evolving strategic response to COVID management,” the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-now-third-in-death-toll/article32470365.ece
29 August 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Kerala sets up ATS to probe Pujari’s activities||The government has tasked the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) of the State Police Crime Branch to unearth the past activities of underworld gangster Ravi Pujari in Kerala. A senior officer said on Friday that Anup Kuruvilla John, Deputy Inspector General of Police, ATS, would liaison with his counterparts in Bengaluru and Mumbai to unearth Pujari's collaborators in the State, if any. The ATS would verify reports that Pujari had set up a protection money racket in Kerala in 2015 and his victims could include wealthy businesspersons. Some might be loath to approach law enforcement. Central agencies had used the Interpol to extradite Pujari to India from Senegal in January. He had been in hiding in the West African nation since 2005. Kerala wanted Pujari mainly in connection with a 2018 bid to extort money from celebrity Leena Maria Paul. Bank fraud case An officer said Pujari had set his sights on Ms. Paul as a likely target for extortion after she became implicated in a Rs. 18 crore bank fraud case. Pujari allegedly used a set of intermediaries to coerce Ms. Paul into wiring money to an offshore account he operated in the name of others. When the bid failed, he "threatened" to harm Ms. Paul. When the plan failed, the accused contracted two "shooters" to fire upon Ms. Paul's beauty parlour in Kochi to prove to her that he could project his power from afar. Though none were hurt in the incident, the gun crime sent a ripple of fear in the business community and the film industry. Last year, the police arrested two of the suspects and recovered a .32 automatic pistol and several rounds from them, sources said . Kerala Janapaksham (Secular) leader P.C. George, MLA, had told the police last year that he had received death threats from Pujari. He said he appeared to have earned the ire of the underworld don for having come out in support of rape case accused Bishop Franco Mulakkal. Mr. George had said he felt the police had wrongly implicated the priest in the case. In custody The accused was currently in the custody of the Mumbai police. Additional Director General of Police, Crime Branch (CB), Tomin Thachankery and Inspector General of Police, CB, S. Sreejith are supervising the probe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-sets-up-ats-to-probe-pujaris-activities/article32470335.ece

If we do not have an exam now, next year for the same number of seats, we will have double the competition. Some students might have crossed their upper age limit. Even if we imagine the average student earns Rs. 20,000 after passing out (I am making a very, very conservative estimate), the collective loss for the 20 lakh NEET and JEE candidates who stand to lose an academic year is Rs. 4,000 crore per month, and Rs. 48,000 crore per annum. Isn’t it a huge opportunity cost? Is anyone looking at this? I urge everyone to let the country progress. The NTA [National Testing Agency] has taken all necessary health and safety measures. Students should enjoy the process of examination rather than stressing about it. The pandemic will eventually finish anyhow. You have spoken of the concern about a zero academic year, but can we declare that the first semester has already been lost? Will there have to be an extension of the 2020-21 year? I don’t agree that the first semester is completely lost. It is being held online by many institutions. We will cover the time loss of the first semester over three years and cover it up. The Supreme Court has ruled that States are empowered under the Disaster Management Act to override UGC’s exam guidelines , but cannot promote students without exams. What impact do you think this will have on final year students? I welcome the decision of the Supreme Court, whose order has upheld the guidelines of the UGC, which were issued keeping students’ careers in mind. Legally speaking, the enactment of UGC can be traced to Entry 66 of the Union list. This allows UGC to make regulations accordingly. The performance in examinations contributes to merit, lifelong credibility, wider global acceptability for admissions, scholarships, awards, placements, and better future prospects. Thus, to safeguard the larger academic interest of the students and career progression globally, it is essential to conduct the final examinations. Already, 209 universities have conducted their exams and around 400 are in the process of holding exams. The NCERT’s survey of high school students in central government schools and CBSE schools shows that at least 27% do not have laptops or smartphones. Is there any government proposal to provide free or discounted devices to students? The Learning Enhancement Guidelines [survey] was undertaken to address the concerns of equity and inclusion. States and UTs were requested to carry out similar mapping exercises and use it for further planning taking cognisance of the availability of the digital resources and ensuring that education is transacted to all. The Ministry of Education recognises that technology is an enabler, and Rs. 839.60 crore has been allocated for integrating information and communication technology into education in 2020-21. Under the Samagra Shiksha scheme, States/UTs have prepared their own innovative systems for integrating ICT into education.  To safeguard the larger academic interest and career progression globally, it is essential to conduct final examinations||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nta-has-taken-all-safety-measures/article32470355.ece
29 August 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Malayalam film chosen for Moscow film festival||Malayalam film 1956, Madhyathiruvithamkoor (Central Travancore), directed by Don Palathara, has been chosen for screening at the 42nd edition of the Moscow International Film Festival to be held in October. Films such as Adoor Gopalakrishnan's Swayamvaram and Venu’s Munnariyippu were screened at the festival in the past. The film, set around themes of migration and human-animal conflict, is Don’s third work. He debuted in 2015 with Shavam , a dark satire set in a household where someone has died. He has continued with that experimental streak in his second film, Vithu , as well as the latest one. According to Don, Moscow festival director Kirill Razlogov wrote that the film 1956, Madhyathiruvithamkoor “ reminds us of the deep-rooted spiritual connections between India and Russia”. “The film is related to the migrations in Idukki and surrounding regions and set in the 1950s. It is about a group of people who are out for a hunt and the events that follow. At the core of the story are two brothers, Onan and Korah, and their relationship. But at the same time, the film also looks at a larger picture, of the thought process and psyche of the people of those times and of that region and the believability of different narratives,” Don told The Hindu . Black and white tone Just like his previous two films, Don has chosen a black and white tone for 1956, Madhyathiruvithamkoor . “For any of these films, choosing to do it in black and white was not a conscious decision. While shooting Shavam , I felt that monochrome fits the realistic treatment of that film. Deep focus and black and white tone gives much more freedom to the viewer in where to focus,” he says. The Moscow festival was supposed to happen in April but got postponed owing to COVID-19. Now, when it is held in October, the organisers plan to have physical screenings, unlike the online screenings at most film festivals these days. Meanwhile, Don has almost completed one more film titled Everything is Cinema , another experimental work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/malayalam-film-chosen-for-moscow-film-festival/article32470338.ece
29 August 2020||New Delhi,||Police, Central cadre under J&K L-G||The Union Home Ministry on Friday notified new rules for administration in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) that specify the functions of the Lieutenant-Governor (L-G) and the Council of Ministers. According to the transaction of business rules, “police, public order, All India Services and anti-corruption” will fall under the executive functions of the L-G, implying that the Chief Minister or the Council of Ministers will have no say in their functioning. The rules notified by Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla say that proposals or matters which affect or are likely to affect peace and tranquillity or the interest of any minority community, the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the Backward Classes “shall essentially be submitted to the Lieutenant Governor through the Chief Secretary, under intimation to the Chief Minister, before issuing any orders”. The Council of Ministers, led by the Chief Minister, will decide service matters of non-All India Services officers, proposal to impose new tax, land revenue, sale grant or lease of government property, reconstituting departments or offices and draft legislation. Difference of opinion However, in case of difference of opinion between the L-G and a Minister, when no agreement could be reached even after a month, the “decision of the Lieutenant Governor shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Council of Ministers”, the rules note. On August 6, 2019, Parliament read down Article 370 of the Constitution revoking the special status of J&K and bifurcated and downgraded the State into the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh, with the former having a Legislative Assembly. The erstwhile State has been under Central rule since June 2018 and the elected Assembly was dissolved in November the same year. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, while introducing the legislation in Parliament last year, said J&K’s Statehood would be restored soon. J&K has been without a Chief Minister since June 2018. According to the requirements of the J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019, fresh elections will be held after the delimitation exercise is completed next year. The rules state that “any matter which is likely to bring the Government of the Union territory into controversy with the Central Government or with any State Government” shall, as soon as possible, be brought to the notice of the L-G and the Chief Minister by the Secretary concerned through the Chief Secretary. 39 departments Under the rules, there will be 39 departments in the UT, such as school education, agriculture, higher education, horticulture, election, general administration, home, mining, power, Public Works Department, tribal affairs and transport. The rules say all communications received from the Centre, including those from the Prime Minister and other Ministers, other than those of a routine or unimportant character, shall, as soon as possible after their receipt, be submitted by the Secretary to the Chief Secretary, the Minister in charge, the Chief Minister and the L-G for information.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/police-central-cadre-under-jk-l-g/article32470352.ece
29 August 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Phase VI of Vande Bharat Mission from September 1||The sixth phase of Centre’s Vande Bharat Mission to repatriate Indians stranded abroad due to COVID-19 will begin on September 1. Phase VI has been announced by the Centre based on an assessment of demand for seats from among stranded Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and feedback from Indian missions abroad. The ongoing Phase V will come to an end on August 31. National carrier Air India, the Air India Group, including Air India Express, and private carriers have been given the mandate to operate the flights. In all, 401 repatriaton flights will be operated by Air India Express in Phase VI that will conclude on September 30. Air India will operate another 144 repatriation flights. The destinations include Vancouver, Toronto, Dubai, Kabul, Singapore, Addis Ababa, Bahrain, and Manila. Of these repatriation flights, 141 flights are to be operated by Air India Express to the four international airports in the State. Kozhikode has been given the highest of 44 flights, Cochin 41, Kannur 31 and 26 for Thiruvananthapuram. Official sources said Non-Resident Keralites will be able to fly to the UAE, Doha and Kuwait on the flights to be operated as part of Phase VI as it has been made clear that the bubble arrangements would continue as per scheduled. Bilateral air bubbles are agreements signed between two countries to resume international flights under certain conditions. India has so far established arrangements with the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, the UAE, Qatar, and the Maldives. Phase VI has been announced when the number of flyers arriving on the repatriation flights was coming down drastically as the situation in West Asia had improved after the spurt in the pandemic. The load factor will be a big concern for the operating airlines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/phase-vi-of-vande-bharat-mission-from-september-1/article32470715.ece
29 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Pandemic-related loss isn’t Centre’s liability’||Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has put forward legal arguments to prove that the Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall due to the pandemic cannot be laid at the Centre’s door, hence absolving it from having to raise loans to finance the same. His intervention came in the middle of a heated debate at the GST Council meeting on Thursday, where Finance Ministers of States ruled by parties opposed to the BJP and the NDA forcefully argued that it should be the Centre and not the States that should raise loans to make up for the revenue shortfall. According to those present at the meeting, opinions of these States were getting traction at the meeting, with Maharashtra suggesting an extension of the five-year period for GST compensation, while Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Puducherry wanted the Centre to raise loans. All the States were in agreement that loans had to be raised to make up for the shortfall. Mr. Sarma, representing the BJP-ruled Assam, cited Section 18 of the 101stAmendment, which said: “Parliament shall, by law, on the recommendation of the Goods and Services Tax Council, provide for the compensation to the States for loss of revenue arising on account of implementation of the goods and services tax for a period of five years.” ‘Legal position clear’ He observed that the mandate of Section 18 was unambiguous, that the Centre was duty-bound to pay the shortfall that arose out of the implementation of the GST regime, whereas shortfall due to the pandemic were not covered under the law. “In addition to the proclamation of a national lockdown, individual States also announced their own lockdowns knowing the fact that it would adversely affect their revenues. In such a scenario, how can the Centre be made liable for the loss in revenue?” he is reported to have said. He dismissed arguments on the “morality” of the Centre’s liability vis-a-vis the States, and asserted that the legal position was clear. “As for a portion of revenue loss that can be attributed to GST implementation, the Centre should grant fiscal space to the States to compensate for that loss,” he stated. Mr. Sarma also noted that large borrowings by the Central government would have a cascading effect on raising interest rates across the country. Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said the Centre should not go for borrowing as it would affect the credit rating of the country in the international market. At Mr. Sarma’s proposal (and seconded by West Bengal), the States agreed to ponder over the two proposals of State borrowing put forward by the Finance Ministry for a period of seven days. The first proposal is of the States directly availing loans from the Reserve Bank of India, with the Centre facilitating the loan and helping get G-security linked interest rates. The second proposal is of the States forming a consortium for availing loans for the amount pertaining to the financial year 2020-21, and revisiting it the next year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pandemic-related-loss-isnt-centres-liability/article32470356.ece
29 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Govt to divest up to 15% stake in HAL||The government is looking to raise around Rs. 5,000 crore by divesting up to 15% stake in state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL). HAL said in a stock filing with the exchanges early this week that the government would sell 33.43 million shares of face value of Rs. 10 each, representing 10% of the total paid-up equity share capital of the company to institutional and retail investors on August 27 and 28. In case of over-subscription, a further 5% stake or 16.71 million shares would be offered. The floor price for the offer was fixed at Rs. 1,001 a share. “Offer for Sale of 15% Govt shares in HAL got enthusiastic response on day one and was subscribed 1.60 times by non- retail investors. Government has decided to exercise the green shoe option. Retail investors get chance to bid on August 28 with a discount of 5% on the cut off price,” the Secretary, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management, said on Twitter on Thursday. In February, the government set an ambitious disinvestment target of Rs. 2.1 lakh crore for 2020-21 and since then the economy has been further hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The government currently holds a 89.97% stake in HAL after selling a 10% stake through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2018 that raised around Rs. 4,229 crore. HAL is the only aircraft manufacturer in the country and assembles and builds a range of military helicopters and aircraft. It has several deals and products in the pipeline on offer for the armed forces.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-to-divest-up-to-15-stake-in-hal/article32470369.ece
29 August 2020||Srinagar,||4 militants killed in Shopian encounter||Four militants, including an Al-Badr militant behind the killing of a grassroots representative whose body was recovered earlier in the day, were killed in an encounter in south Kashmir’s Shopian on Friday. “Four or five terrorists were engaged in an encounter in an orchard in Kiloora area. The hiding militants opened fire when the security forces cordoned the area and started a search operation. Later, four terrorists were killed and one was captured alive”, Inspector-General of Police Vijay Kumar said. It was a difficult task to make the militant surrender in a live encounter. “We appeal to all parents of the militants to convince their wards to surrender,” Mr. Kumar said. The police identified the two slain militants as Shakoor Parray, an Al Badr ‘district commander’, and Suhail Bhat. “Bhat was behind the abduction and killing of a panch [grassroots representative] Nisar Ahmad Bhat,” Mr. Kumar said. Rifles snatched Parray had fled with service rifles in Awantipora where he worked as a Special Police Officer (SPO) before joining the militancy and had managed to recruit around 10 youth to resurrect Al-Badr, the police said. Two AK rifles and three pistols were recovered from the encounter site, the police said. Earlier in the day, the police spotted the body of Nisar Ahmed Bhat, in the orchards of Dangam. “The panch had gone to meet Abdul Rashid Bhat, father of militant Suhail Ahmed Bhat, of Muradpora at 1 p.m. on August 19 when he went missing,” the police said. The panch was an ex-policeman and a former terrorist and was booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA) earlier. “There were 12 FIRs against him,” a police source said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/4-militants-killed-in-shopian-encounter/article32470371.ece
29 August 2020||Belagavi,||Statue installation triggers tension||Tension prevailed at Peeranwadi, near Belagavi, on Friday after a group of unidentified persons placed a statue of Sangolli Rayanna before daybreak on a makeshift pedestal at the Y-junction on the national highway that passes through the village. As the news spread on Friday morning, another group tried to install a statue of Shivaji at the same place, arguing that the junction was named “Shivaji Circle”. The police stopped them from going ahead. As the group started swelling and people demanded removal of Sangolli Rayanna’s statue, police attempted to convince them that the issue would be dealt with legally as it was put up without permission. Meanwhile, some distance away from the area, members of Sangolli Rayanna Yuva Sangha and Karnataka Rakshana Vedike took out a protest against attempts to install Shivaji statue. As crowds swelled and the situation threatened to go out of hand, the police resorted to lathi-charge. Police Commissioner K. Thiyagarajan, Deputy Commissioner of Police Seema Latkar, and Assistant Commissioner Narayan Baramani spoke to both the groups and convinced them to eventually leave the area. Later in the day Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath convened a meeting of all stakeholders and it was decided that the situation would be resolved after a meeting of district in-charge Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi and Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K.S. Eshwarappa on Saturday. Mr. Jarkiholi told journalists in Gokak that he would speak to leaders of all parties before arriving at a decision. He urged all parties to back down a bit so that a solution could be found that would be acceptable to everybody. This is the second time in two weeks that local youth tried to install Sangolli Rayanna statue at the Y-junction. Police removed it when it was placed the first time on August 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/statue-installation-triggers-tension/article32470330.ece
29 August 2020||Srinagar,||Ram Madhav meets Kashmir leaders||BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav is on a three-day visit to Kashmir and is meeting party leadership and several regional leaders in the wake of National Conference’s bid to spearhead an alliance of seven regional parties to launch a joint fight for restoration of J&K’s special status. Mr. Madhav met senior BJP leaders from Srinagar on Friday and sought a “feedback on the security scenario” and “the recent political development”, party sources said. The meeting was also attended by BJP general secretary in J&K Ashok Koul, Sunil Sharma and Vibodh Gupta. Addressing the party leaders, Mr. Madav likened the Gupkar Declaration to NC’s Plebiscite Front. “Sheikh [Muhammad Abdullah] got the Chief Minister’s post in 1975 and the NC forgot plebiscite demand,” he was quoted as saying by those who attended the meeting. He termed the Gupkar Declaration another political stunt by the NC. Mr. Madhav on Thursday met several regional leaders, including J&K Apni Party’s Ghulam Hassan Mir and Usman Majeed and disgruntled leaders from the Peoples Democratic Party and the J&K Peoples Movement, apparently to cobble together to a new political force to counter Farooq Abdullah’s new regional alliance to demand the return of the special status. He also met PDP patron Muzaffar Hussian Baig. BJP sources said Mr. Madhav’s three-day visit has come in the backdrop of NC’s Gupkar Declaration. The BJP is working towards an informal alliance in Kashmir valley, “both to blunt the narrative of the NC and boost its electoral prospects for the future.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ram-madhav-meets-kashmir-leaders/article32470617.ece
29 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||NHRC notice to J&K police on tweet||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) this week issued a notice to the Jammu and Kashmir police after finding that a tweet by the Kashmir Zone Police on August 21 tried to “glamorise” encounter killings of alleged terrorists. The NHRC has asked for a report by October 1 after taking suo motu cognisance of the case based on the “Twitter handle of Imtiyaz Hussain”, referring to the Senior Superintendent of Police (Security, Kashmir), according to the case proceedings available on the Commission’s website. Mr. Hussain had quoted the tweet by the Kashmir Zone Police on August 21 about the action that led to the death of four alleged terrorists. An NHRC source said it was Mr. Hussain’s quote-tweet that was brought to the knowledge of the Commission as being a senior officer he had retweeted and “endorsed” the Kashmir Zone Police’s tweet. “By releasing video of attack, #terrorists want to glamourise #terrorism. But they can’t. We replied by actions & killed 04 top cmdrs, Sajjad @ Haider & FT Taimur Khan @ Abu Usman (seen in said video/attack) & Naseer @ Sad bhai & FT Ali bhai @ Danish within 72 hours. @JmuKmrPolice (sic),” the Kashmir Zone Police’s official handle tweeted on August 21. Quoting the Kashmir Zone Police’s tweet, Mr. Hussain, tweeted: “We work within the parameters of law, with utmost restraint and highest regard for human lives. Outlaws can only be cowards. Befitting reply by us with elimination of entire gang. Jai Hind.” While stating that the Commission understood that “some police officer” had responded to the release of a video of an attack on security forces, the NHRC said: “The officer has this way tried to glamorise the action taken by the police by killing four persons stated to be top commanders of a terrorist group.” “... the forces while doing their lawful duty do have a right to respond in self-defence while they are dealing with an extraordinary situation like an ambush or attack by the miscreants, but it does not give the right to the police and security forces to kill anyone at their will and then glamorise the killing,” its proceedings stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nhrc-notice-to-jk-police-on-tweet/article32470374.ece

29 August 2020||Belagavi,||Two arrested on charge of killing Dalit youth||The Vijayapura police have arrested two persons on charges of hacking to death a Dalit youth, allegedly because he tried to assert his equality by sitting along with ‘upper’ caste people in a temple on the same platform a few days ago. In a video statement, Superintendent of Police Anupam Agrawal said Siddu Biradar and Santosh Hirlakund, aged between 23 and 25, were arrested. He said the accused had fought with the victim over the same issue a few days ago. They face charges of committing caste atrocities and murder of Anil Ingalagi, 25, of Boodigal P.H. village near Sindagi. The youth had attacked the victim with knives and killed him when he was having tea in a hotel in the village on Thursday. The father of the deceased complained to the police that the accused were angry with Anil as he had sat on a platform in the temple “at the same level as them”. Meanwhile, the parents of Siddu Biradar have told the police that Anil was Siddu’s employee in the local gambling den. They had a long-standing dispute over money and that led to the fight, they said. Deputy Commissioner P. Sunil Kumar has sought a report on the incident, officers said.

29 August 2020||CHENNAI,||Congress MP succumbs to COVID-19||Congress MP from Kanniyakumari H. Vasanthakumar died of COVID-19 on Friday evening. He was 70. He is survived by his wife Tamil Selvi, sons Vijay Vasanth and Vinodh and daughter Thanga Malar. Mr. Vasanthakumar, who started his career as a salesman and went on to found Vasanth & Co, and Vasanth TV was admitted to Apollo Hospitals here on August 10. “Mr. Vasanthakumar was admitted on August 10, with COVID infection. He was treated in a critical care unit for severe COVID pneumonia. Despite all active medical measures, his condition deteriorated gradually due to COVID complications and he passed away today,” Apollo Hospitals said in a release. Born in a family of Congress supporters at Agastheeswaram near Kanniyakumari, Mr. Vasanthakumar studied at S.T. Hindu College at Nagercoil. He was the younger brother of former Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president Kumari Anandan and the uncle of Telangana Governor and former BJP Tamil Nadu president Tamilisai Soundararajan. Mr. Vasanthakumar was elected to the Tamil Nadu Assembly from Nanguneri in 2006 and 2016. He resigned from the Assembly in 2019 to contest in the Lok Sabha election from Kanniyakumari where he won against Pon. Radhakrishnan of the BJP by 2.59 lakh votes. Mr. Vasanthakumar was one of the working presidents of the TNCC and one of the ‘richest’ candidates to contest in the Lok Sabha election, declaring assets worth Rs. 412 crore. He started his career working for the VGP brothers, selling transistors, before launching his own venture in 1978, Vasanth & Co, to sell home appliances. Always seen wearing the badge ‘Vetri Nichchayam’ (victory is sure), he motivated youngsters to work hard to come up. He also popularised the concept of EMI that became a hit among the poor and the middle class. “He used to say that coming from a village to Chennai, he could earn each day’s livelihood would be earned only if he was able to sell 50 Murphy transistors. From that stage, he created such a big business empire. God has not given him an opportunity to enjoy that. He also has the record of asking the maximum number of questions in Parliament,” TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said. An ardent fan of former Chief Minister K. Kamaraj, Mr. Vasanthakumar, when he was an MLA, created ‘evening schools’ in more than 100 villages for conducting special coaching classes for children from poor families. He also launched interest-free loan schemes for hawkers and pavement vendors.

Chidambaram expressed condolences on Twitter. Mr. Modi said, “Saddened by the demise of Lok Sabha MP H. Vasanthakumar Ji. His strides in business and social service efforts were noteworthy. During my interactions with him, I always saw his passion towards Tamil Nadu’s progress.” “The news of Kanyakumari MP, H Vasanthakumar’s untimely demise due to Covid-19 has come as a shock. His commitment to the congress ideology of serving the people will remain in our hearts forever. Heartfelt condolences to his friends and family members,” Mr. Gandhi said. Mr. Chidambaram said all Congress workers were deeply distressed and saddened by the death of the MP. “He was a devoted Congress worker and always a bundle of energy and enthusiasm. He contributed immensely to the welfare of his constituents both as MLA and as MP,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vasanthakumar-cong-mp-succumbs-to-covid-19/article32470411.ece

The case was originally registered by the police of Nallakunta on October 8, 2019, after the police conducted searches at the house of Maddiletti, which led to the seizure of several incriminating letters, documents and digital devices that established his close association with senior leaders of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and top leaders of their frontal organisations. ‘Raising funds’ Further investigation revealed that the members of frontal organisations, including Telangana Vidyarthi Vedika and Telangana Praja Front, in association with underground leaders of proscribed organisation Communist Party of India (Maoist), were engaged in furthering the activities under the guise of welfare activities such as taking up issues concerning students and society and raising funds through educational institutions, the officials said. “They were also luring, radicalising and recruiting youth into the banned party for engaging in anti-national activities against democratically-elected governments,” the investigators stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nia-chargesheet-against-four-for-maoist-links/article32470332.ece
29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Realism should shape India’s China policy’||This is a relationship, in Mr. Jaishankar’s view, that is now playing out on a global stage, and its future could ultimately “boil down to… whether each is sufficiently accommodative of the other’s rise”. For India, this includes whether China will be open to India’s permanent membership of the U.N. Security Council, while India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, which “reflects both India’s arrival as a technology player” and which China has opposed, would be another such indicator. Recognition of the global significance of the relationship — and the need for both countries to find ways to accommodate the other — was one key driver, Mr. Jaishankar says, behind the two summits between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi. “What was different at Wuhan and Chennai was not just the intensity of the engagement,” he writes, “but its setting against the evolving global backdrop in which both have such an important role. The practice of leaders of India and China having geopolitical conversations ceased many decades ago. Its resumption could well be a sign of a different future”. The Minister acknowledges that the past continues to cast a long shadow, and “the Chinese perhaps don’t realise how lasting the impact of the 1962 conflict has been on Indian public opinion”. The “loser” in the war, he writes, “was not just India but the relationship itself” with “every new border face-off” reviving those memories. On settling the boundary question, Mr. Jaishankar says that China going back on the positions taken by Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, broadly suggesting a swap in western and eastern sectors, presents “a new conundrum”, with Beijing now “characterizing the eastern sector as the main area of dispute”. Economic challenge Mr. Jaishankar foresees “a sharper edge” to the economic component of the relationship, where “the initial advocacy in India of more trade with China has now given way to strong resentment at its one-sidedness”. The prospect of deeper economic collaboration, he argues, is by no means a foregone conclusion, with India reassessing an unequal trading relationship that has developed “without a semblance of reciprocity”. Like the rest of the world,” he writes, “India too is finding it difficult to come to terms with a state capitalist model that has no precedent.” Regional connectivity is another area where both countries would, on the surface, have shared interests, but are coming to terms with negotiating different visions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/realism-should-shape-indias-china-policy/article32470344.ece
29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Six States move Supreme Court on NEET, JEE||The petition comes shortly after a meeting among Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and six Chief Ministers of non-BJP States. JEE is slated to be conducted over 660 exam centres with 9.53 lakh students taking it. This would be roughly 1,443 students in every centre. Similarly, NEET will see 15.97 lakh students in 3,843 centres across the country, nearly 415 students per centre. “The Union Government had adequate time to make comprehensive preparations for the safe and successful conduct of the examinations. However, the intervening months from April to September were characterised by inaction, confusion, lethargy and inertia,” the petitioners submitted. They said the Centre had suddenly woken up to hurriedly fix the exam dates, realising that its inertia would cost lakhs of students their career. “The remedy will prove to be worse than the disease itself,” the petition said. ‘Situation is grave’ The Ministers said they do not want to launch a “political criticism” or make any “value judgments” of the Central government. All they wanted to do was impress on the court the fact that the rise in COVID-19 cases continued to be exponential since April. The situation was grave enough to recall or postpone the exams. The petition has been filed seeking a review of the top court’s order on August 17 refusing to entertain a petition by students to postpone NEET and JEE.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/six-states-move-supreme-court-on-neet-jee/article32470345.ece

In another message, which is a part of the Congress’s ‘Speak Up for Students’ campaign, former party chief Rahul Gandhi said the government should have a conversation with students, listen to them and decide on holding the NEET and JEE only after developing a consensus. “Everybody understands the mishandling of COVID, the way the epidemic has been handled ... the devastation that has been caused, the economic destruction and the pain that this country has had to bear. Now, what I don’t understand is why you should be held responsible and why further pain should be imposed on you?” said Mr. Gandhi in the video. “I can clearly see that the government has been incompetent. So why should the government force anything on you? It is important that the government listens to the students,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-calls-for-students-consensus-on-neet-jee/article32470360.ece

Publishing information based on gossip about the line of investigation by the official agencies on the crime committed is not desirable,” a PCI statement said. “The media is advised not to conduct its own parallel trial or foretell the decision to avoid pressure during investigation and trial,” the statement said.

29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||States can apply to UGC for extension of deadline||They were issued in the interests of students. They provided three modes of examination — pen and paper, online and blended (both physical and online). A “special chance” was also given to students unable to take the exams. Time given to varsities It said universities were moreover given time from July 31 to September 30 for preparations. Justice Bhushan drew attention to clause 6 of the revised guidelines, which insists that exams can be held only if universities follow the safety protocols. The Centre, too, had pitched in with guidelines. “The Standard Operating Procedure for conduct of examination makes it abundantly clear that the UGC, MHRD [Ministry of Human Resource Development] and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare were fully concerned with the health of students and exam functionaries,” the court held. Justice Bhushan said the UGC was well within its rights to fix “uniform” dates for the exams despite some States being worse off. “The UGC had rightly fixed a date for completion of the final-year examination throughout the country to maintain uniformity in the academic calendar,” Justice Bhushan justified. The court said the July 6 guidelines did not discriminate against final year students by compelling them to take exams while their juniors were promoted on their internal assessment marks. For future career “Final year exam is an opportunity for a student to show his optimum calibre. It paves his future career both in academics and employment,” Justice Bhushan noted. The court held that the UGC was not obliged to consult universities or States before the issuance of the July 6 guidelines. Besides, States and universities cannot dismiss UGC guidelines as being merely advisory. They were necessary for the “determination of standards in institutions of higher education”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/states-can-apply-to-ugc-for-extension-of-deadline/article32470343.ece

29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Tactful Vidura||Sanjaya returns after meeting the Pandavas, but when Dhritarashtra asks him what Krishna and the Pandavas said, Sanjaya says he will convey this in the royal court the next day. Sanjaya’s decision is right, because if Dhritarashtra were to twist Sanjaya’s words and a war breaks out as a result, Sanjaya might be blamed. Moreover, it is important that all the elders and wise men in court should know what has happened. So Sanjaya keeps the news for the morrow. An agitated Dhritarashtra is unable to sleep and sends for Vidura. Vidura is wise, and his behaviour is laudable too, said Kidambi Narayanan, in a discourse. He follows all the required rules. Although it is Dhritarashtra who has asked him to come, Vidura still waits outside the palace until he is summoned in. And once there, he pays respects to his king Dhritarashtra and asks him why he was sent for, and what the king wants him to do. Dhritarashtra says he is unable to sleep, and is fearful. Vidura could have immediately told Dhritarashtra that his excessive attachment to his sons was leading him to make wrong decisions. But Vidura is diplomatic. He says there could be many reasons for a man’s sleeplessness, and he lists them. A man who has illegitimate desires, one who wants to grab another’s property, one who has lost his property — these are all people who cannot sleep. Vidura asks Dhritarashtra if he falls in any of these categories. Had Vidura been direct in his criticism of the king, Dhritarashtra would not have listened to him further. And Vidura, as a wise man, concerned about his family and his country, wants the king to make the right decisions. So he goes about advising Dhritarashtra indirectly. One who advises must be tactful like Vidura, and must not irritate the listener.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tactful-vidura/article32470363.ece
29 August 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||CPI(M) points fingers at BJP||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Friday sought to politically weaponise the Customs summons to Janam TV coordinating editor Anil Nambiar in a bid to put the State leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the dock in connection with the UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case. The Customs had questioned Mr. Nambiar, a prominent presenter in the purportedly pro-BJP channel, at its Commissionerate in Kochi on Thursday. The CPI(M) had taken considerable flak from the BJP earlier for the alleged association of the accused in the smuggling case with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s former Principal Secretary M. Sivasankar. The CPI(M) State secretariat said the depositions of the accused had revealed that Mr. Nambiar had directed them to tell the Customs that the incriminating air cargo consignment that contained 30 kg of contraband gold was personal freight and not diplomatic baggage. The CPI(M) said Mr. Nambiar’s position was consistent with that of Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan. The CPI(M) asked whether Mr. Muraleedharan’s statement was a cue to the accused to lie to investigators. It said Sandeep Nair, another suspect in the case, was a registered BJP member. The BJP could not shrug off its guilt of association with the accused in the case by ‘lying’ that it had nothing to do with Janam TV. BJP State general secretary George Kurien said the CPI(M) had attempted to create a bogus scandal. Mr. Muraleedharan had merely pointed out that the air freight imported by the UAE consulate did not match the definition of ‘diplomatic bag’ exempted from Customs inspection as per the Vienna covenant. Mr. Kurien said the BJP was not answerable for Mr. Nambiar’s actions. He was not a member of the party. Janam TV was privately owned. Mr. Nambiar, an independent journalist, was a professional hire. The BJP had no stake in Janam TV.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cpim-points-fingers-at-bjp/article32470334.ece

29 August 2020||HYDERABAD,||‘Confer Bharat Ratna on PV’||The State Assembly will adopt a resolution seeking Bharat Ratna for former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao at its session beginning on September 7. By another resolution, the Centre will be requested to rename Hyderabad Central University after Narasimha Rao as he was behind the setting up of the university, it was decided at a meeting convened by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to review the programmes in connection with the year-long centenary celebrations of the late leader. The State government will rename Necklace Road where the cremation of Rao took place as P.V. Gnan Marg. A memorial of international standard for him will also be constructed in Hyderabad. Mr. Rao said it was decided to take up an exhaustive discussion on the contribution of the former Prime Minister preceding the resolution in the Assembly. A portrait of Narasimha Rao will also be installed in the Assembly hall. The State government will demand a similar portrait of him in the Parliament hall. Giving details of further programmes in memory of Narasimha Rao, the Chief Minister said the P.V. Gnan Marg will be developed with greenery. A statue will also be installed on the road. Laknepalli, the birthplace of Narasimha Rao, and Vangara, where he grew up, will be developed as tourist centres. In this connection, the Chief Minister directed Tourism Minister to visit the two villages and prepare the plan for the purpose. He wanted the memorial in Hyderabad to reflect the contribution of Narasimha Rao in different fields. An ideal location will be identified. A proposal should be made to UNESCO to institute an international award in his name in the fields of science and technology and literature. The cash component of the award would be paid by Telangana government, he said. World-wide celebrations The centenary celebrations should be held in different parts of the world. Already, arrangements were made in the US, Singapore, South Africa, Malaysia, Mauritius, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. The former US President Bill Clinton and former British prime ministers John Major and Cameroon should be invited to India to participate in the celebrations as Narasimha Rao had forged close ties with these countries as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Mr. Rao said he will personally write letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Ramnath Kovind and various chief ministers to participate in the celebrations. The unpublished articles of Narasimha Rao should be published by Telangana Sahitya Akademy. A book should be brought out of articles written by him in various newspapers. Another book comprising his public speeches and interviews should also be produced. A coffee table book on his life should be printed. Mr. Rao wanted a photo exhibition on Narasimha Rao accompanied by cultural programmes and delicious food. He asked officials to place orders for statues of Narasimha Rao at New Delhi, Hyderabad and other centres. The meeting was attended by centenary celebrations committee chairman K. Keshava Rao, Narasimha Rao’s son Prabhakar Rao and daughter Vani Devi, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar and others. Ms. Vani Devi presented to Mr.Rao books written about her father and those that he himself wrote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ts-to-make-plea-to-confer-bharat-ratna-on-pv/article32470414.ece

29 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Guterres flays India’s coal subsidy||United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday criticised India for subsidising fossil fuels and promoting coal auctions. Mr. Guterres was delivering the 19th Darbari Seth Lecture, organised by the Delhi-based The Energy Resources Institute (TERI). “Clean energy and closing the energy access gap are good business. They are the ticket to growth and prosperity. Yet, here in India, subsidies for fossil fuels are still some seven times more than subsidies for clean energy. Continued support for fossil fuels in so many places around the world is deeply troubling,” Mr. Guterres said in a pre-recorded message. “Recent research on G20 recovery packages shows that twice as much recovery money has been spent on fossil fuels as clean energy. In some cases, we are seeing countries doubling down on domestic coal and opening up coal auctions.” The UN Secretary-General, however, commended several of India’s commitments to clean energy, including the initiative on the International Solar Alliance, plans for a World Solar Bank that would mobilise Rs. 70 trillion of investments in solar projects over the coming decade and, commitment to installing 500,000 MW of renewable energy by 2030. Mr Guterres’ criticism of coal auctions at the event, which was presided over by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, is significant in the backdrop of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s launching of the auction of 41 coal blocks for commercial mining earlier this year as part of India’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan. Mr. Modi had said the launch marked not only the implementation of reforms in the coal sector but also the creation of lakhs of jobs and would liberate the sector from decades of “lockdown”. The government has decided to spend Rs. 50,000 crore on creating infrastructure for coal extraction and transport, which would also create job opportunities for locals closer to their homes, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/guterres-flays-indias-coal-subsidy/article32470376.ece

According to State Water Resource Department, the upper catchment of the Mahanadi, which falls in Chhattisgarh, has recorded heavy downpour during the past two days. In Chhattisgarh, rainfall was measured at 264.2 mm at Champa, and at 248.4 mm in Basantpur, on Friday. “As per the engineers’ assessment, 6.60 lakh cusecs of water from Chhattisgarh is entering Hirakud Reservoir. If water discharge from the Ib and Bheden rivers of Odisha is taken into consideration, Hirakud would receive more than 8 lakh cusecs water,” said Pradeep Jena, Managing Director, Odisha State Disaster Management Authority. Huge inflow of water forced the Hirakud authorities to open 20 sluice gates in the morning. Later, 20 more gates were opened to release flood water.

29 August 2020||HYDERABAD,||Why permit Ethephon usage: HC asks Centre||Telangana High Court on Friday asked the Central government to explain how it had allowed usage of Ethephon, which has traces of insecticide and other chemicals, for artificial ripening of fruits. Hearing a batch of PIL pleas and writ petitions on usage of chemicals for ripening fruits, the HC said long term usage of Ethephon was likely to cause cancer in human beings. Would the government be happy if people contract cancer due to usage of such chemicals, a bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy questioned. In 2015, the then Hyderabad High Court for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana State suo motu took up newspaper reports on usage of calcium carbide for artificial ripening of mangoes and other fruits as a PIL petition. This year, another PIL plea was filed challenging usage of Ethephon for ripening of fruits. Meanwhile, two traders filed writ petitions questioning registration of cases against them by the government for sale and distribution of Ethephon. They contended that the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India permitted sale of Ethephon. ‘Why no counter?’ The bench sought to know from Assistant Solicitor General of India N. Rajeshwar Rao as to why no counter affidavit was filed on usage of Ethephon. Mr. Rao sought two weeks of time, stating that a memo was already filed. Senior counsel S. Niranjan Reddy, who was appointed by the HC as amicus curiae in the PIL pleas, said laboratory tests confirmed that Ethephon had traces of insecticide and other chemicals. Special Government Pleader Sanjeev Kumar, representing the State government, contended that Ethephon can be used in limited quantities. However, the State government decided to permit usage of En-Rype which has no ill-effects. Ethephon is not supposed to directly come in contact with the fruits. Sachets of Ethephon would be kept in bunches of fruits for artificial ripening of the latter. The bench sought to know from the ASG as to why the Centre was not confirming if Ethephon had traces of insecticide. Cancer patients The bench remarked that number of cancer patients in the country had gone up in the past three decades. Senior lawyer D. Prakash Reddy, appearing for the traders, said the Ethephon sachets would release Ethylene gas which would ripen the fruits. This would not result in any harm, he said. The bench, disagreeing with the senior counsel’s contentions, said the possibility of the powder directly coming in contact with fruits during transportation, cannot be ruled out. While conceding that Ethephon should not directly come in contact with fruits, how can one say its usage is not harmful, the bench remarked. Directing the Centre to file counter affidavit in the matters by September 15, the bench posted the pleas to September 17 for next hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/why-permit-ethephon-usage-hc-asks-centre/article32470412.ece

Hitting out at Mr. Tharoor, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) working president and party’s chief whip in the Lok Sabha Kodikunnil Suresh on Friday said everybody in the party should work according to its policies and programmes. “Shashi Tharoor is certainly not a politician. He came to the Congress party as a guest artist. He is still continuing in the party like a guest artist,” said Mr. Suresh, who represents the Mavelikara constituency in the Lok Sabha. Taking a dig at Mr. Tharoor, the former Union Minister also said, “Mr. Tharoor may be a global citizen, but he should not think that he can take any decisions or say anything according to his will.” “Ultimately, he should follow the party (policies and programmes),” Mr. Suresh told reporters here in response to a query. His statement came a day after Mr. Tharoor said it was the duty of all to work together in the interest of the Congress once the party chief had stated that the matter was “behind us”.  “I’ve been silent for 4 days on recent events in @INCIndia because once the Congress President says the issue is behind us, it is the duty of all of us to work together constructively in the interests of the Party,” Mr. Tharoor had tweeted on Thursday. “I urge all my colleagues to uphold this principle & end the debate,” he said in the tweet. Earlier on Thursday, former KPCC president and Lok Sabha MP K. Muraleedharan had also taken a dig at Mr. Tharoor over the issue, calling him a “global citizen’’. Leaders in the Congress’s State unit are upset with Mr. Tharoor over his open support to the Centre’s move to lease out the Thiruvananthapuram international airport to the Adani Group. “The people want the airport. It’s some politicians who are opposed to it,” Mr. Tharoor had said while all political parties in Kerala, barring the BJP, had opposed the Centre’s decision.

29 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A city that allowed businesses, old and new, to thrive||From Madras to Chennai — the industrial landscape in the city has undergone a radical change in the last few decades. The city that, from the early 1950s to the 1980s, was dominated by family-owned businesses in engineering, manufacturing and automobiles is getting to see new-age entrepreneurs in artificial intelligence, aerospace, banking and finance and Software As a Service (SaaS). While the top old corporate firms run by traditional families of Madras are very much active, the industrial landscape has expanded to give space to a large number of entrepreneurs and industrialists, international collaborators, even lakhs of medium, small and micro industries. In the industrial space, Madras has a lot of credits to boast about. The country’s first industrial estate came up in the city (at Guindy) in 1958. The year 1965 saw the birth of the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO), which facilitates large industrial and infrastructure projects in the State. In 1971, the State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu Ltd (SIPCOT) was set up to provide comprehensive infrastructure facilities for investors. The Madras Stock Exchange (which is now defunct), the fourth stock exchange in the country, ran its operations from here. Even the telecom revolution started in Chennai with industrialist C. Sivasankaran and his Sterling Group. It was during the Madras era that the Murugappa Group manufactured the first bicycle in the country and Enfield the first motorcycle. “Standard Motors from Madras was the second Indian car manufacturer. Ashok Leyland established a commercial vehicle unit here. Madras became the cluster for auto-component manufacturing with groups such as TVS, Amalgamations and Rane setting up shop. And this is how Madras came to be called the ‘Detroit of India’,” said Sushila Ravindranath, author of the book Surge: Tamil Nadu’s Growth Story . “When the government announced in 1951 that it would decide on who could manufacture cars and where — Ashok Motors and Standard Motors were given licence to manufacture in Madras,” she said. In 1957, Dunlop set up its plant in Madras to make tyres. Currently, Chennai houses the world’s best car names, including Ford and Hyundai, and accounts for 30% of India’s four-wheeler automobile industry and 33% of auto-parts production. During the Madras days, business houses and families were conservative and would never even imagine selling their stakes to an outsider. In Surge: Tamil Nadu’s Growth Story, Ms. Ravindranath points out that the fear of outsiders has now gone. “The local businessmen no longer resist either foreigners or those from outside the State setting up business here. The State government welcomes investors.” In the last five years, the city hosted two Global Investors Meets. IT sector The city has witnessed a huge change with the arrival of information and technology. Even before Madras was renamed Chennai, a slew of IT firms were slowly setting up operations in the city (this was in the 80s). Several Y2K firms emerged during the 1990s. Sify’s birth happened in Madras during mid-1990s. During those days, IT offices were scattered in various areas. It was in 1999 when TCS moved to Sholinganallur, the OMR belt became the IT corridor. Today, it houses Cognizant and Infosys and also has many new-age start-ups head-quartered in the city. Commenting on the evolution of the IT sector, Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, past president of the 184-year-old Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says, “For decades, the tech industry in Chennai was synonymous with IT services and BPO, building scale and growing in global stature. Because of the rich engineering talent pool, it attracted most of the Top 25 services players to the city to innovatively solve business problems of Fortune 500 companies.” He added, “The city has transformed itself beyond services to products, platforms, engineering and as-a-service companies and has also emerged as a thriving hub for technology-driven start-ups. With digital technologies such as cloud, data, IoT and security fundamentally changing the business, operations and experience models of companies, Chennai today is a lot more heterogeneous catering to a broader canvas of clients’ technology and business needs.” Chennai is emerging as a hub for commissioning, operation and maintenance of data centres and work spaces to help people with all kinds of resources to run businesses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-city-that-allowed-businesses-old-and-new-to-thrive/article32470504.ece
29 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu to continue with PM’s crop insurance scheme||While States such as Gujarat, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are pulling out of the revamped crop insurance scheme, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), Tamil Nadu is sticking with it and going ahead with the process of choosing insurance companies. The Agriculture Department has called for e-bids that can be submitted till the noon of September 2. Bids will be opened the same day, if there is no extension of the deadline, and it may take a few days for completing other formalities, including the issue of work order to the selected companies, explains an official of the Department. Once selected, the insurance companies will be involved in enrolment of farmers for three years, till the end of the 2022-23 ‘rabi’ cultivation season that covers ‘samba’ and ‘navarai’ in Tamil Nadu. One of the main reasons for the State government to continue with the scheme is the high coverage of farmers with the payment of compensation in times of crop loss. During the first three years of the scheme (2016-17 to 2018-19), 70% of the farmers enrolled were compensated for crop loss. Totally, in the last four years, 49.6 lakh farmers were paid around Rs. 8,934 crore in compensation. Another official points out that in the inaugural year of the scheme, 2016-17, the State had faced its worst drought in the last 140-odd years. Among the factors that have contributed to the success of the scheme in Tamil Nadu are the “timely payment” of premium subsidy by the State government to the insurance companies; “prompt” execution of crop-cutting experiments; and furnishing of yield data. The “burden” of premium subsidy to be paid by the State government is less, compared with those States that have withdrawn from the scheme. Another significant feature of the implementation of the scheme in the State is the presence of a substantial number of non-loanee farmers, accounting for 75% of those enrolled every year. It is this factor that will ensure that the changes in the stipulations, especially voluntary enrolment, will have no impact on the State. During the 2020 ‘kharif’ cultivation season, which covers ‘kuruvai’ in Tamil Nadu, 82% of those enrolled belong to the category of non-loanee farmers. The area insured and the number of farmers enrolled have increased this year by 50% and 38%, compared with the past, the official adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-to-continue-with-pms-crop-insurance-scheme/article32470522.ece
29 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Anticipating, preparing for workplace clusters||The world over, as lockdowns are eased or lifted and people get back to work, clustered outbreaks of COVID-19 in occupational settings have been reported. Chennai is no exception to this. As several of the restrictions were relaxed, even as the lockdown per se continues, employees were allowed to return to their workplaces, concerns have begun emerging. The Greater Chennai Corporation has said the positivity rate has been rising among workers of commercial establishments over the past few days. “The government has relaxed e-passes [norms] to revive the economy in the unlocking phase. As a result, the number of cases is rising. We anticipated it. So we have taken measures to contain the spread,” says Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash. “These are not large clusters in the sense we understand that word. They are smaller groups of people who have started to come back to work, and subsequently test positive. They could, of course, have been infected at home, or anywhere outside. But when people work in an enclosed space, without observing certain norms, the chances of transmission are high,” clarifies Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan. 30% positivity rate According to the Corporation, the positivity rate in tests done in many commercial establishments has indicated a positivity rate of over 30%. For instance, 20 out of 60 employees tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday in a commercial establishment in George Town on Friday. Last week, the positivity in commercial establishments was around 10%, they claim. In such instances, the establishments have been sealed and workers isolated. “We will reopen the establishments in a few days and permit workers who tested negative for COVID-19. Health experts will give assistance to commercial establishments and advise them how to resume operations,” said a Corporation official. “We do not want anyone to feel threatened or agitated. We are basically looking to address the challenges in the workplaces,” Dr. Radhakrishnan says. Those who go back to work should strictly follow the protocol, and if there are symptoms, they will be encouraged to avail the government’s free testing facilities. The incidence of such clusters must be anticipated, and preparations made, given the global experience. An European Centres for Disease Prevention and Control report recorded that 15 European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom reported 1,376 clusters of COVID-19 in occupational settings which occurred between March and early July. WHO guidelines While relaxations of lockdowns are inevitable, and essential, Ivan D. Ivanov, team lead, Occupational and Workplace Health, WHO, lists certain precautions that must be taken at the workplace. Besides the usual recommendation for physical distancing, use of masks, hand hygiene and periodic disinfection of common surfaces, he calls for regular risk assessment and interventions to reduce social mixing. Managements should split teams and stagger work and rest hours for employees so that gathering together for lunch or coffee breaks can be avoided. The document calls for informing health authorities once someone tests positive and facilitate proper contact tracing. Prabhdeep Kaur, deputy director, ICMR’s National Institute of Epidemiology, who is on the State’s health expert team, tweeted similar advice: “1. Implement 100% mask policy. 2. Enable social distancing by reorganising workspaces. 3. Provide hand sanitisers in multiple places. 4. Limit the number of people using cafeteria at a time.”  We do not want anyone to feel threatened or agitated. We are basically looking to address the challenges in the workplaces  J.

29 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tirukkural welcomes you at this police station||Anbum aranum udaiththaayin ilvaazhkkai panbum payanum adhu — this couplet from Tirukkural , explaining the importance of love and compassion in a household, welcomes anyone who walks into the Avadi All Women Police Station (AWPS). The station’s compound walls and the interiors are painted with couplets from Tirukkural with their meaning explained beneath. “There are 14 Kurals written at the station. These are from Tirukkural ’s Illara Iyal which speaks about domestic life. We are trying to get these messages registered in the minds of couples who walk into the station. We would be happy if it can bring about a change in at least some of them,” said T. Latha, inspector, who took the initiative to have the couplets painted at the station. The station handles cases pertaining to crimes against women and children from places like Avadi, Avadi Tank Factory, Thirumullaivoyal, Pattabiram, Muthapudupet and Tirunindravur. “On an average, we get 10 complaints pertaining to domestic disputes per day and at least two POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act cases per month. Most complaints are about illegal affairs, alcoholic husbands abusing the wife and children and domestic violence. A few of the complaints are due to misunderstandings and lack of proper communication between the couple. When such people walk in for counselling, they can read all these messages,” Ms. Latha said. There are 23 police personnel at the station. “When we conduct awareness camps, we recite the Kural and educate the people about its meaning,” said Ms. Latha.

29 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||From humble origins to the top of the retail industry||One of the pioneers in the retail revolution of Madras, a marketing legend and a person with a business knack — this is what businessmen who had worked with H. Vasanthakumar had to say about him. “He joined our family business, VGP showroom, at Saidapet during the 1970s. He joined as an ordinary worker and within a few months became a salesman. Seeing his work and dynamism, my father promoted him as the branch manager,” said V.G.P. Ravidas, managing director of the VGP Group. He recollected that in those days, salesmen from VGP went for a door-to door campaign, and Mr. Vasanthakumar was one of the key canvassers. “While other salesmen strike 5-10 deals a day. Vasanthakumar would come back with 50 orders...,” Mr. Ravidas said. In 1978, he started Vasanth & Co, a consumer durable firm, which sold wired chairs. During those days, Mr. Vasanthakumar was the owner, marketer and salesman for the brand. As years passed, the firms started selling television sets, fans, air-conditioners, mobile phones and other home appliances. He worked with brands such as LG, Samsung, Sony, Philips, Whirlpool and Sharp. Today, the firm has its branches across the State. “He was a legend — a marketing and innovation genius. All the manufacturers of white goods queued up to tie up with Vasanth & Co to sell their products because of attractive consumer schemes launched by Mr. Vasanthakumar,” said Gopal Srinivasan, Chairman, TVS Capital Funds. Mr. Gopal Srinivasan worked closely with Mr. Vasanthakumar when the TVS Group had a joint venture with Whirlpool. Whirlpool had forayed into Indian market in the late 1980s in a joint venture with the TVS Group.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/from-humble-origins-to-the-top-of-the-retail-industry/article32470512.ece
29 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC denies bail to Kodanad case accused||The Madras High Court on Friday refused to grant bail to the 2017 Kodanad Estate heist-cum-murder case accused K.V. Sayan and Valayar Manoj. The relief was denied on the ground that an interview given by them, in January 2019, implicating Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami in the case was aimed at misdirecting the trial. Justice R. Subramanian refused to independently re-examine the effect of the interview when Justice G.K. Ilanthiraiyan of the High Court had on March 3, 2019 already held that it amounted to interference in administration of justice. A re-examination now, “I am afraid... would amount to judicial indiscipline on my part,” the judge said. “Once I reach the said conclusion, I have no other option but to concur with the findings of the learned judge whatever I might have thought if the matter had come before me as res integra (an unexamined issue). So long as the findings (by the other judge) stand, I do not think I can over reach the said findings and conclude otherwise,” he added. However, pointing out that Justice Ilanthiraiyan, while disposing of a plea for speedy trial by a prosecution witness, had recently directed the Principal District and Sessions Court in the Nilgiris to conclude the trial in the case within three months, Justice Subramanian too ordered that the trial should be completed within the prescribed time limit. The sprawling Kodanad Estate was owned jointly by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and her close aide V.K. Sasikala. After Jayalalithaa’s death on December 5, 2016 and Sasikala’s incarceration in a disproportionate assets case on February 14, 2017, a heist was reported in the estate on the intervening night of April 23 and 24 of 2017. An armed gang had reportedly trespassed into the estate and decamped with some valuables after murdering a security guard. Police investigation reportedly revealed that the crime was plotted by Jayalalithaa’s former car driver C. Kanagaraj, with the assistance of others, but he got killed in a road accident at Attur in Salem on April 29, 2017. On the same day, Sayan too had met with a road accident in which he lost his wife and child near Palakkad in Kerala. The police arrested him on June 6, 2017 when he was recuperating in a hospital and he came out on bail granted by a judicial magistrate on September 11, 2017 since the police had failed to file a charge sheet within 90 days. As far as Manoj was concerned, he was arrested on May 1, 2017 and granted bail on December 15, 2017. After their release, the duo gave a video interview to a New Delhi based journalist Mathew Samuel in January 2019 alleging that the entire crime took place at the instruction of the Chief Minister and that Kanagaraj had confided it to them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-denies-bail-to-kodanad-heist-cum-murder-accused/article32470497.ece
29 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||From just a remote, serene suburb to a bustling city space||In the early 1960s, people who dreamed of a house of their own, in a serene neighbourhood, would choose Nanganallur. Though the locality has undergone several changes since, old-timers say it continues to retain its old charm. Nanganallur or ‘Nangainallur’ developed into a much-preferred suburb after a group of people, including employees of various government departments and private firms, formed the Nanganallur Building Co-operative Society and the National Cooperative Society and purchased agricultural lands left barren. There were only a handful of houses in Pazhavanthangal village then. “I was fed up with living in congested portions of houses in Saidapet and Mambalam. I bought land in Nanganallur for Rs. 1,600 in 1966,” recalled V. Rama Rao, a long-time resident of the locality and founder of the United Forum of Nanganallur Welfare Associations. Though there was no bus connectivity, people chose to migrate to Nanganallur as it was close to suburban railway stations at St. Thomas Mount and Meenambakkam then. “We used to alight at St.Thomas Mount and hire a jutka (a horse cart) for Rs. 5 to Vanuvampet, and then walk home,” he said. As Alandur was only a panchayat then, the cooperative societies took initiatives to develop civic infrastructure. Nanganallur is also a temple town. From a remote suburb to a bustling city locality close to the airport, Nanganallur has turned self-sufficient in infrastructure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/from-just-a-remote-serene-suburb-to-a-bustling-city-space/article32470508.ece

29 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Project in Theni violating Air, Water Acts, says NGT committee||A committee formed by the southern bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has found that a developer in Periyakulam taluk in Theni district had commenced work on a project without getting Environmental Clearance and consent from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and is continuing to violate the provisions of the Water and Air Acts. The case relates to an application filed by an advocate that Bahri Estates Pvt. Ltd., had developed a layout for retirement community at Genguvarpatti village in Periyakulam taluk and the layout spanned 121.84 acres. In January this year, the Tribunal directed a committee to inspect the area and ascertain whether the project was begun without the EC and its impact on eco-sensitive areas and forest, wildlife and existing water bodies. A nine-member committee in its report submitted that “the developerhas excluded seven acres of the land from the total area of layout in order to avoid the process of the EC. “Based on the NOCs obtained and actual utilisation of adjoining area, the area of project activity is more than 50 hectares and thus it attracts the provisions of Schedule 8(b) (B1 category) of the EIA Notification, 2006, which needs to be appraised by the SEIAA-Tamil Nadu.” The committee said based on the TNPCB’s direction, the developer in 2014 had applied for the EC before the SEIAA-TN, but it was pending. The developer, however, did not make use of a six-month window in 2017 for entities not complying with environment regulation to apply for EC. The Tribunal asked the committee to submit an ‘action taken report’ and assess environmental compensation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/project-in-theni-violating-air-water-acts-says-ngt-panel/article32470501.ece

Thirumavalavan is keen on infusing new blood into the party by filling 25% of the posts of district secretary with workers in their 30s. Villupuram MP and party general secretary D. Ravikumar said around 90 new district secretaries would be appointed in September. “This time, the party is determined to give youth an opportunity. The young people in their 30s will be given the posts.” “We also want to accommodate more OBCs, minorities and women in the party. Furthermore, anybody with a criminal background will not be given these posts hereafter,” Mr. Ravikumar said. He said the party was serious about making these posts more diverse. “The selection will be based on their contribution to the party, and the application has been invited online.” Explaining the ‘no criminal background’ clause, Mr. Ravikumar said the party leader “...has specifically announced that those with criminal cases shouldn’t apply for the post of district secretary”. Mr. Ravikumar said the party had introduced crucial changes to the eligibility criteria. “It has fixed two three-year terms as the limit for a district secretary. We have mentioned that those who have already served as district secretaries twice cannot even apply. And those who have completed a three-year term this year should compulsorily pave the way [for others] and wait for the next round of appointments after three years,” he said. General secretary Sinthanai Selvan said around five candidates would be recommended for every post of district secretary to the party president who would take a call after consultations with senior leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vck-plans-to-infuse-party-with-young-blood/article32470530.ece

Shankar who was shot dead by Ayanavaram police on New Avadi Road here on August 21 would be transferred soon to the Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID), State Public Prosecutor A.

In so far as the petitioner’s other plea for exhuming the body and conducting a re-post-mortem was concerned, the SPP said there was absolutely no necessity for undertaking such an exercise since the entire post-mortem had been conducted as per norms and it had also been recorded on video to allay all kinds of apprehensions.

29 August 2020||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Promoter’s plea against SNJ takeover bid of Empee Distilleries rejected||The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), New Delhi, has rejected a plea against the approval given for SNJ Distilleries’ Rs. 475 crore takeover bid for Empee Distilleries by its promoter by Shaji Purushothaman. SNJ had emerged as a successful bidder for Empee Distilleries under the insolvency process and the National Company Law Tribunal, Chennai, had approved its plan in January. Before the NCLAT, Shaji Purushothaman the promoter/director of Empee Distilleries, argued that his Rs. 513 crore settlement proposal to lenders was arbitrarily rejected. The NCLAT said Purushothaman’s plan was rejected by lenders due to its structural layout and inability to satisfy them with regards to generation of funds/mobilisation of resources and specific and a clear cut debt/claim satisfaction mechanism. “Ambiguity in regard to generation/raising of funds for translating the Settlement Plan into action as also in regard to specific schedule of payment to various stakeholders being writ large on the face of the proposed Settlement Plan, it has met the inevitable fate of rejection at the hands of Committee of Creditors,” it said. The NCLAT also noted that SNJ has paid nearly 51% of the monies owed under the resolution plan and also commenced commercial operations of Empee and it cannot be said that a ‘just settlement’ has been arbitrarily rejected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/promoters-plea-against-snj-takeover-bid-of-empee-distilleries-rejected/article32470534.ece

29 August 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Industries reiterate demand for extension of moratorium||Industries across sectors in Coimbatore and Tiruppur districts are waiting for a positive announcement from the government regarding extension of moratorium period for repayment of loans. The moratorium provided by banks ends on August 31 and the associations seek time till the end of this financial year to start repaying the loans. One of the hotel owners in Coimbatore said he had received more than 20 calls in the last two days from his bank saying that he has to start repayment in the first week of September. “We are operating at just 30 % capacity and with just about 30 % staff. In the first week of September, I need to keep cash ready to pay the staff. There is no word yet from the Government regarding the moratorium period. When business is still down, where will I go for the funds to repay the loans too?” he asked. Another hotelier said if a restaurant used to serve 1,000 coffees a day earlier, it makes just about 100 now. The colleges are closed, majority of the office goers are working from home, and bus and train services remain suspended. Thus, there is hardly anyone who steps into a hotel for a tea or snack. Those functioning out of rented buildings are the worst affected as the owners are asking for payment of rents since April-May. Hotels and restaurants have taken a hit in the last few months and they need financial support from the government, he said. In Tiruppur, garment exporters are seeing enquiries coming in from overseas buyers and are hopeful of orders picking up. “We are still in survival mode and not yet stepped into performance mode. The industries are operating with several limitations. If the banks and the government do not extend the moratorium period, all the stakeholders will be at risk as the industries will not be able to start repayment from next month,” said Raja Shanmugham, president of Tiruppur Exporters Association. The industries are not asking for subsidies. They only want time to repay the loans, he said. In the case of textile mills, only some will benefit from the one-time debt restructuring scheme announced by the government. Several textile clusters are functioning at 30 % to 40 % capacity and the migrant workers have just started returning to work here. The mills need more time to repay the loans, according to Southern India Mills’ Association and South India Spinners’ Association. Coimbatore District Small Industries Association and several other industrial associations here have appealed to the Central Government, Reserve Bank of India, and the banks to consider extension of the moratorium period. The Joint Council of Associations of Coimbatore has said in a press release that the MSMEs were operating at just about 50 % capacity and the demand had not improved since June this year. The units need to continue making the statutory payments such as GST and ESI for workers. “The MSMEs are not in a position to repay the loans with accrued interests to the banks/financial institutions,” the council said. Term loan Apart from extending the moratorium period for repayment of loans, the accrued interest should be converted into a term loan to be repaid in two years, without interest. The NPA norms should also be relaxed, it said. The Federation of Coimbatore Industrial Associations said the micro units were facing slow revival of market and hence business remained dull. The government should give seven more months time for the micro and small-scale industries to resume repayment of loans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/industries-reiterate-demand-for-extension-of-moratorium/article32470562.ece

29 August 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||District administration steps in to contain COVID-19 spread in Coimbatore||The district administration today stepped in to contain the spread of COVID-19 in city, and support, coordinate and monitor the Coimbatore Corporation’s action in this regard. A release issued at the end of a meeting Collector K. Rajamani held at the Collectorate with Coimbatore Corporation and other department officials said he had designated an officer each to the Corporation’s five zones to increase the effectiveness of the steps the civic body took. He asked the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation Regional Manager S. Prasanna Ramasamy to coordinate the activities in South Zone, District Revenue Officer-cum Special Officer P. Menaka to work in North Zone, P.A. Lands Vishnu Vardhini in East Zone, Magalir Thittam Project Officer Selvaraj in West Zone and Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Chief Regional Manager Sadhanaikural in Central Zone. Besides asking the officers to update him daily of the steps taken, the Collector asked the Corporation Commissioner Sravan Kumar Jatavath to increase the number of tests to ensure early detection of COVID-19 cases, ensure that the test results were available within 24 hours, conduct awareness on safety precautions among the city’s residents and also about the place and timing of fever camps. The release said Collector K. Rajamani directed the coordination officers to work with police and other department staff to ensure that the Corporation officials on the field diligently followed all COVID-19 containment precautions and that there was no violation in containment zones/quarantined areas. He also asked the Corporation to keep ready ambulances to take COVID-19 positive persons to hospitals or COVID-19 care centres or to transport them from one facility to another. ‘More triage centres’ In a related development, Coimbatore Corporation threw open two more triage centres – one in West Zone at the auditorium at the Government College of Technology on Thadagam Road and another in South Zone at a wedding hall in Kuniamuthur. The Corporation had already established such a centre at its Siddhapudur school in Central Zone. It had said the centres would act as the nodal centres or points of first stop for COVID-19 positive persons and the medical officers there would decide where such persons would go – to hospitals or care centres. One more triage centre was ready – for East Zone – and it would start serving people Saturday onwards, Commissioner Sravan Kumar Jatavath said. The Corporation had identified seven to eight places across the city where it would establish beds in less than 24 hours if there were to be a spike in positive cases. And, in those centres, the Corporation would add 1,500 beds. On the Corporation’s decision to ask commercial establishments to get their employees tested, Mr. Jatavath said it was a must and the Corporation’s order did not mean that the establishments would have to pay for the test. Pool testing They could either go in for pool testing which was cheap or make use of the Corporation’s fever clinics/camps, where samples were lifted for tests at no cost. If during inspection or after COVID-19 case it was found that establishments had not had their employees tested, the Corporation would initiate stringent action.  And, this was necessary because of late, commercial establishments had turned COVID-19 hotspots, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/district-administration-steps-in-to-contain-covid-19-spread-in-coimbatore/article32470551.ece

29 August 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Do not conduct NEET, JEE, says Congress||Congress cadre staged a protest here on Friday against conducting National Eligibility and Entrance Test (NEET) Joint Entrance Exam (JEE). V. Karthikeyan, a party functionary, said many students would not even be able to attend the exam due to absence of public transport during the COVID-19 lockdown. “If conducted, it will be like robbing opportunities for students from rural areas to join professional courses and dashing their dreams,” he said. Conducting the exams would lead to spread of COVID-19 among students who may become carriers, he said. Tirunelveli Led by former Union Minister R. Dhanushkodi Athithan, Congress cadres gathered in front of the party office in Tirunelveli and staged a protest. Though the Congress was for scrapping the NEET as it was destroying the future of medicine aspirants from poor families in rural areas, the Centre should not conduct the examination at least this year, Mr. Athithan said. In the agitation in Thoothukudi, the Congress cadre, led by Thoothukudi city district president Muraleedharan, raised slogans against NEET. Virudhunagar Members of National Students’ Union of India, led by Virudhunagar MP B. Manickam Tagore, staged a demonstration in Virudhunagar. Mr. Tagore said the number of students appearing for NEET had drastically come down in Tamil Nadu this year. After Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s intervention, seven States ruled by Opposition parties approached the Supreme Court against the conducting of NEET, as it posed a danger to the health and life of students. However, the Tamil Nadu government that has been claiming to be opposing the NEET had not joined the other States opposing it. “The State government has written a letter to the Centre seeking to scrap NEET. This is only a drama played out under the diktat of the Centre,” Mr. Tagore alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/do-not-conduct-neet-jee-says-congress/article32470810.ece
29 August 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Panel mistook ‘demonetisation’ for ‘devaluation’: High Court||Expressing displeasure over an expert committee’s failure to differentiate between the terms ‘devaluation’ and ‘demonetisation’ of currency, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Friday directed the Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board to award 0.5 marks to two petitioners who had missed out on the cut-off by the slimmest of margins. The court was hearing the petitions filed by T.S. Abinesh and K. Rajkumar, who had applied for the direct recruitment to the post of Sub-Inspector of Police (Taluk, Armed Reserve and Tamil Nadu Special Police) 2019. They secured 48 marks in the written examination, missing out on the cut-off mark by 0.5 mark and failed to make it to the next round. The main contention of the petitioners is that one of the questions asked in the examination was: “How many times the Indian rupee was devalued since 1947?” The right answer was “three times” and the same was given in the preliminary key answer too. However, in the final key answer it was given as four times and the petitioners missed out on selection by 0.5 marks. Justice R. Suresh Kumar observed that apart from the devaluation of currency thrice, the expert committee had also taken into account the demonetisation of the [Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000] currency in 2016. Therefore, the expert committee had concluded that the answer to the question was “four times”. There is a difference between ‘devaluation’ and ‘demonetisation.’ Devaluation is the reduction in the official value of a currency in relation to other currencies and demonetisation is the act of stripping a currency unit of its status as legal tender, the court pointed out. It wondered how the expert committee of teachers had given a contrary opinion. The mistake, though appears to be a small one, will have a wider ramification and would create a cascading effect in the selection process. The two petitioners, despite giving correct answers, have not been awarded the marks because of the expert opinion and have missed their chance of getting selected, the court noted. It opined that the recruitment board should be cautious and keep vigil in selecting experts to be included in the committee to give an expert opinion on the key answer. To avoid such controversy, a second expert opinion can also be obtained, apart from the existing committee of experts, the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/panel-mistook-demonetisation-for-devaluation-high-court/article32470827.ece
29 August 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Speak to them’ to be launched soon||Ahead of World Suicide Prevention day, Nandini Murali director of SPEAK, plans to launch ‘Speak to us,’ a helpline to address callers who phone in with psycho-social distress. Speaking to The Hindu , Ms. Murali, herself a survivor of suicide loss, says while the first two years of Speak went towards awareness creation and sensitisation of the impact of suicide, she felt the need to create a tool to aid more people. The helpline, which will start functioning from September 10, aims to help distressed persons from varied backgrounds. Speak has 70 volunteers from Chennai, Bengaluru and Madurai who give assistance in Tamil, English and Hindi. Itis partnering with The Alternative Story, an organisation which provides counselling services to individuals and organisations, for for technical support. Ms. Nandini says those who suffer abuse, have anxiety and are undergoing a range of other psycho-social distresses can call the helpline. “Most volunteers have a background in psychology but we are providing training on basic counselling skills and gender and sexuality. We are trained in addressing issues across the gender spectrum and will provide district-wise referrals,” she says. The callers will remain anonymous but the data will be used for research. “With persons who have suicidal ideation, it has been observed that the earlier one interferes, the better is the outcome,” she says. The volunteers would need to de-stigmatise themselves in order to become responsible frontline workers. “Much of the discourse regarding suicide is internalised. There is a pervasive shame and it is often situated in the context of crime and morality. When one discusses suicide in the lens of morality, it becomes counterproductive to the narrative to help de-stigmatise the discussion around the topic,” she says. She hopes to normalise discussions regarding suicide and hopes that more people who have survived loss due to suicide can provide counter narratives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/speak-to-them-to-be-launched-soon/article32470822.ece
29 August 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Admissions sluggish in schools for visually impaired students||Admissions to the three schools for visually impaired students in Madurai is very slugglish.

Although admissions began 10 days back, till date only five students have joined the three schools - three in IAB and two in St. Joseph’s school. N. Karpagam, the School Coordinator of IAB, says usually around 50 students join Classes 6 to 12 in their school. But only three students have joined Class 11 till date. The school heads say they get the addresses of the students from District Differently Abled Welfare office, go to their homes to convince their parents to send their children to the schools. “Usually students from the Madurai peripheries, neighbouring districts such as Theni, Dindigul and Virudhunagar come to Madurai for school education as there is a dearth of special schools in other districts,” says Sr. Backiamary, Headmistress of St. Joseph’s school. Convincing needed Most of the students hail from interior pockets and belong to underprivileged families. “In this time and age, there are still people who do not want to send their visually impaired child to a school,” she says. But this year they have not been able to reach these children owing to lack of public transport and other restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 lockdown, says K. Mahalakshmi, Headmistress of the Government Middle School. “Parents are also unable to bring their children to Madurai owing to lack of public transport,” she says. Ms. Karpagam says it is important to take steps to ensure that students do not lose this academic year. District Differently Abled Welfare Officer (in charge) M. Jeyaseeli says they are ready to arrange vehicles to help schools in their admission process.  Parents are also unable to bring their children to Madurai owing to lack of public transport  N.

Palaniswami on Friday categorically asserted that the AIADMK would lead an alliance in the State, whenever the next Assembly election was conducted. “Right from the days of former Chief Ministers late M.G.

Earlier, in Tiruvarur, Mr. Palaniswami had parried a question on the issue, saying that alliances would be decided at the time of the elections and that he felt it was a needless discussion at this stage, only to come up with a more direct affirmation later in the day. He said that the State government had reached out to his counterparts in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and preliminary discussions were on among the States about the Cauvery-Godavari link project. “We are making strenuous efforts to implement the project and have sought the cooperation of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana governments. I had written to the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh and had also spoken to him. Two Ministers were also deputed to the States for talks. The Chief Ministers of the southern States have agreed to strive together to implement the project. We have begun preliminary talks,” he said. Irrigation in the delta When his attention was drawn to the fact that the current storage at the Stanley reservoir in Mettur would be sufficient only for two months’ irrigation in the delta, Mr. Palaniswami said his government was taking all necessary steps to get Tamil Nadu’s due share of Cauvery water from Karnataka. “We are taking up the issue at the Cauvery Water Management Authority meetings. We are conveying our requirements and getting our due share of water as per the Supreme Court verdict,” he said. He replied in the negative when asked whether the State cess on petrol and diesel would be cut.  Right from the days of late M.G.

29 August 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||He spent liberally on education for the poor||As we call him on his mobile phone, ‘Olimayamaana ethirkaalam en ullaththil therikirathu…’ in late T.M. Soundararajan’s refreshing voice would enthral the caller for a few seconds before Mr. Vasanthakumar, in a brisk voice, answering the call. After the usual exchange of pleasantries, Vasanthakumar would immediately move on to understand the problem, if any, in his constituency. When he represented Nanguneri Assembly constituency between 2006 and 2011, Vasanthakumar, an ardent follower of late Chief Minister K. Kamaraj, created ‘evening schools’ in more than 100 villages under this segment for conducting special coaching classes to the children from poor families. He ‘appointed’ unemployed graduates with bachelor of education degrees in these ‘evening schools,’ mostly women, to teach children between 5 p.m. and 7.30 p.m., and paid their salary. The ‘evening schools’ were reopened when he was elected again to the Assembly from the constituency in 2016 and the schools are functioning even after he resigned the post to successfully contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls from Kanniyakumari. Vasanthakumar was funding studies of close to 50 poor students from Nanguneri constituency, all pursuing their higher studies in arts and science colleges, polytechnics and engineering colleges. While addressing a party meeting organised during the run-up to 2016 Assembly polls, he said: “I believe Kamaraj is not an ordinary man. He is a God as he accorded highest priority to education of rural children. I, a devotee of that great man, will continue to support education of poor children till the end.” When the High Court directed the State government to uproot the thorny Prosopis juliflora, an invasive species, across Tamil Nadu, he purchased an earthmover for Rs. 29 lakh from his personal funds. He also bore the recurring expenditure like wages for the operator, fuel, repairing charges, if any, to weed out this invasive species from all places in his Nanguneri constituency. The equipment was used to remove these thorny shrubs grown abundantly in private properties also without causing any expenditure to owners of these lands. After the removal of Prosopis juliflora was stopped, the earthmover was used to desilt irrigation tanks and supply channels. During his tenure as the legislator, Vasanthakumar, with his personal funds, desilted 52 rain-fed and systemised irrigation tanks and a good number of supply channels associated with these water bodies. Apart from releasing funds from the MLAs constituency development fund, he had spent more than Rs. 2 crore from his personal funds for constructing school buildings in his constituency. Though he was keen on reviving the Nanguneri multi-product Special Economic Zone that came into existence in 2001 towards the fag end of DMK regime, all his attempts went in vain due to non-cooperation of governments between 2006 and 2011 even though Congress’ electoral ally DMK was in power and 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/he-spent-liberally-on-education-for-the-poor/article32470831.ece

29 August 2020||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Human fatalities from elephant attacks on the decline in Gudalur||A multipronged approach towards managing problematic human-elephant interactions is leading to fewer human fatalities due to elephant attacks in Gudalur in The Nilgiris district. The recent death of 64-year-old A. Palaniyandi in O-Valley marked the second human fatality attributed to an elephant attack in Gudalur, this year. Recent methods adopted to nullify opportunities which could lead to problematic interactions between humans and elephants in the landscape has led to a gradual reduction in the number of injuries and fatalities to humans over the last few years. From just a few years ago, when 13 persons had died in a single year in the region, the measures adopted by the Forest Department over the last few years has led to a gradual reduction in the number of fatalities, with only five deaths recorded since 2019. A major factor in the reduction in the number of problematic human-elephant interactions can be attributed to the continuous monitoring mechanism of elephant herds by the forest department which has been in place since 2017. Using this method, each elephant herd in each range in Gudalur is tracked throughout the day and into the night with the information communicated to local residents. District Forest Officer, Gudalur division, Sumesh Soman, said that each night, anywhere between 60-70 forest staff are deployed throughout the division to keep tabs on elephants in the landscape, especially those individuals or herds that move close to human habitations. The Forest Department is continuously working on ways to refine and improve the methods they have been using. Recently, all vehicles used by the forest department to conduct patrols, including the Rapid Response Team (RRT) vehicles, have been fitted with microphones to announce to local residents the movement patterns of elephant herds in the division. “This will ensure that announcements can be heard by people within a few square kms of where the elephants are at any given moment, and act as a warning system,” said a forest ranger attached to the Gudalur forest division. “After the night patrols are completed, the same members, who had been tracking the elephants throughout the night, will also share information about the number of elephants, their last location and other details to tea estate workers who are entering the estates to work in the morning,” said Mr. Soman. While the steps taken to minimise problematic human-elephant interactions has had a discernible impact on minimizing human fatalities over the last few years, the five deaths recorded in 2019 and 2020 are mostly deaths which could have been “prevented” with a little more caution, said forest department officials. “Most of the deaths are accidental and preventable, with people venturing out from their homes in the dark when they come across an elephant, or when they move through forests in an inebriated condition. If people who live in these regions can also exercise a certain amount of caution while living and working alongside elephants, these deaths too can be prevented,” added Mr. Soman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/human-fatalities-from-elephant-attacks-on-the-decline-in-gudalur/article32470536.ece

Kathiravan has instructed the private company involved in road widening works to supply cable for 6 km length. Ongoing works to double lane Anthiyur – Bargur – Kollegal road led to damage of cables on the ghat road on August 24. Efforts by the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) workers to carry out repairs to the snapped cables at nine places did not yield results. Since BSNL is the only service provider in the hills, people in over 10 villages continue to face hardship due to the absence of network. Since replacing the cable is the only solution to restore the services, BSNL took up the issue with District Collector C. Kathiravan, who asked the company to supply cable for 6 km length. A senior BNL official said that once they receive the cable from the company, replacement work would commence and services would be restored at the earliest. In February, service was disrupted in the hills for 10 days after cables were damaged at 50 spots during road widening works. Mr. Kathiravan then asked the company to replace cable for 2 km length while BSNL was asked to replace it for 1 km length.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/telecom-services-remain-cut-off-in-bargur-hills-for-fifth-day/article32470543.ece

29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Kanniyakumari MP Vasanthakumar dead||He was the younger brother of former Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president Kumari Ananthan and the uncle of Telangana Governor and former BJP Tamil Nadu president Tamilisai Soundararajan. Mr. Vasanthakumar was elected to the Tamil Nadu Assembly from Nanguneri in 2006 and 2016. He resigned from the Assembly in 2019 to contest in the Lok Sabha election from Kanniyakumari where he won against Pon. Radhakrishnan of the BJP by 2.59 lakh votes. Mr. Vasanthakumar was one of the working presidents of the TNCC and one of the ‘richest’ candidates to contest in the Lok Sabha election, declaring assets worth Rs. 412 crore. He started his career working for the VGP brothers, selling transistors, before launching his own venture in 1978, Vasanth & Co, to sell home appliances. Always seen wearing the badge ‘Vetri Nichchayam’ (victory is sure), he motivated youngsters to work hard to come up. He also popularised the concept of EMI that became a hit among the poor and the middle class. “He used to say that coming from a village to Chennai, he could earn each day’s livelihood only if he was able to sell 50 Murphy transistors. From that stage, he created such a big business empire. God has not given him an opportunity to enjoy that. He also has the record of asking the maximum number of questions in Parliament,” TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said. An ardent fan of former Chief Minister K. Kamaraj, Mr. Vasanthakumar, when he was an MLA, created ‘evening schools’ in more than 100 villages for conducting special coaching classes for children from poor families. He also launched interest-free loan schemes for hawkers and pavement vendors. He was vociferous in his demands for his constituency in the Assembly and repeatedly sought the establishment of a Special Economic Zone at Nanguneri. He also had the Lok Sabha in splits while making demands for Kanniyakumari. In his condolence message, President Ram Nath Kovind said Mr. Vasanthakumar, an entrepreneur and social activist, earned his name in the world of politics and business. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member P. Chidambaram expressed condolences on Twitter. Mr. Modi said, “Saddened by the demise of Lok Sabha MP H. Vasanthakumar Ji. His strides in business and social service efforts were noteworthy. During my interactions with him, I always saw his passion towards Tamil Nadu’s progress.” “The news of Kanyakumari MP, H Vasanthakumar’s untimely demise due to Covid-19 has come as a shock. His commitment to the congress ideology of serving the people will remain in our hearts forever. Heartfelt condolences to his friends and family members,” Mr. Gandhi said. Mr. Chidambaram said all Congress workers were deeply distressed and saddened by the death of the MP. “He was a devoted Congress worker and always a bundle of energy and enthusiasm. He contributed immensely to the welfare of his constituents both as MLA and as MP,” he said. Kumari Ananthan, former TNCC president, was hospitalised in Hyderabad after hearing about the death of his brother, a party statement said. Mr. Ananthan is the father of Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kanniyakumari-mp-vasanthakumar-dead/article32470505.ece

The Government considers the number inadequate and have asked the Corporation to prepare a revised scheme providing at least eight public conveniences.

29 August 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Multiple reasons behind Rayanna statue taking centre stage||What started as a minor dispute over installing of a statue of Sangolli Rayanna without permission at Peeranwadi village in Belagavi district, has blown up into a State-level issue within a fortnight. It reached a flashpoint on Friday when the statue was installed before dawn by unidentified people and another group tried to install a statue of Maratha ruler Shivaji at the same place. There have been demands in recent times for naming structures in Bengaluru and other places after the freedom fighter from Nandagad in Belagavi district, who fought for queen Chennamma of Kittur and was eventually executed by the British. Caste and language issues, besides political ambitions of leaders, appear to be linked to the resurgence of the demand for installation of Sangolli Rayanna statue in an obscure village in the border district where Kannada-Marathi linguistic pride is quick to reach a flashpoint. On Friday, while Congress leader Siddaramaiah and Minister K.S. Eshwarappa demanded installation of the statue at Peeranwadi, BJP MLC A.H. Vishwanath (now a ministerial aspirant) demanded that a tall statue of Rayanna be placed in front of the Suvarna Soudha in Belagavi. All three are leaders of the Kuruba community to which Rayanna belonged. Political observers say the issue has multiple dimensions. “The Kuruba youth considers Rayanna as an iconic warrior from the community, as he was born in the Sangolli Rogannanavar family at Nandagad that belonged to the Kuruba community. Secondly, in a place such as Belagavi, he is seen as a Kannada hero juxtaposed to a Maratha leader like Shivaji. These are reasons enough behind the resurgence of the demand for erection of his statues. But the possibility of a political motive is strong behind such sudden movements,” said D.S. Chougale, a Belagavi-based writer. He added that such national heroes go beyond the confines of caste and language groups Ashok Chandaragi, convener of the central committee of Kannada organisations in the district, also suspects strong political undercurrents behind the sudden resurgence of the demand. “A few days ago, the city police removed a Rayanna statue as it was installed at Peeranwadi without due permission. What was limited to a village was made into a State-level issue by political leaders,” he said and added that it was part of a desire to assume community leadership and demonstrate its lobbying powers. Raghunath Malkapure, former MLC who has served as office-bearer of the Kuruba Sangha, said there were political dimensions to the assertion of the Kuruba identity. He contends that while the community leadership was so far assumed to be that of leaders such as Siddaramaiah, there is now an effort to “decentralise” the leadership. “This is not to say that it will be inclined towards the ruling BJP. But it is changing for sure,” Mr. Malkapure said. Mahadev Talwar, State convener of the Karnataka Rakshana Vedike, decried attempts to label Rayanna as a Kuruba leader. “Rayanna is a national hero. Is this how we treat national heroes? The government is diluting the struggle by giving it a political colour,” he alleged. The district administration faced a similar problem last month when some youth tried to place a Shivaji statue at the village square at Managutti. The police removed the statue and held a meeting of village elders. Local Maratha and Kannada groups held a joint press meet where they said they had resolved the issue locally, without the need for outside influence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/multiple-reasons-behind-rayanna-statue-taking-centre-stage/article32470466.ece
29 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘No clarity on when schools will reopen’||With COVID-19 severely hitting the education sector, Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar on Friday said that the government was still not sure about the dates for reopening schools and the manner in which classes will function. “We still do not know when to open schools or how classes will be held and how to go about the teaching methodology once the schools reopen,” Mr. Suresh Kumar said on Friday, after the launch of Shikshaka Mitra app that the department had developed for teachers. Deputy Chief Minister and Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan on Wednesday announced that degree colleges in the State will reopen on October 1 and the academic year will commence from September 1 through online classes. Mr. Suresh Kumar said that the coming academic year would be a “challenging one” as they were planning to begin the implementation of the National Education Police (NEP). He also said that those supporting the postponement of NEET and JEE examinations should see how successfully and smoothly the SSLC students wrote their exam. Speaking about pending transfer of teachers, he said that the process would begin from the first week of September and that it would be done in a transparent way. Boards merger Mr. Suresh Kumar also said that the process of merging the SSLC Board and the PU Board would “begin soon.” “Like we have the Higher Education Council, there is a need for a similar council for primary and secondary education. In that regard, we will form a similar council for primary and secondary education soon,” he said, The Shikshaka Mitra app was launched by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and it would help teachers in getting their provident fund advances, leaves, applying for transfers and loans, among others. “Now, teachers need not run from pillar to post to get their work done. Earlier, they had to even apply for leaves to do so,” Mr. Suresh Kumar said, adding that the information of around 2.5 lakh teachers had already been uploaded on the app and that it would be used in the transfer process that will begin from next month. Helpline Meanwhile, with an aim to address the grievance of teachers, students, parents, and employees of the department, the ‘Shikshana Vani’ helpline was also launched on Friday. People can contact the tollfree number 1800-425-7302 or WhatsApp at 9483045130 or mail shikshanavani.edn@gmail.com for grievance redressal or to file a complaint. The Education Minister also launched the ‘Education Ministers’ Dashboard’ which will be a one-stop system where all the information regarding the department would be available including the Student Achievement Tracking System.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-clarity-on-when-schools-will-reopen/article32470475.ece
29 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Claims Commissioner appointed to assess damage||The High Court of Karnataka on Friday appointed H.S. Kempanna, a retired judge of the high court as Claims Commissioner to access the damages caused to public and private properties during the August 11 violence at D.J. Halli and K.G. Halli localities, and to investigate the liabilities. The Claims Commissioner, the court said, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, can conduct the proceedings, including recording of statements through videoconferencing facility by following the rules notified by the high court. The court also directed the government to give wide publicity and to issue public notices, after seeking approval of the Claims Commissioner, asking the people to submit details and documents with regard to the damage caused to their properties. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S Kinagi passed the order while hearing three petitions, one filed by the State government, and two other PIL petitions. In all the petitions, one of the pleas made was for appointing a Claims Commissioner as per the Supreme Court’s directions for accessing damages caused to public and private properties and to grant compensation to the victims as per the apex court’s guidelines. The Bench also directed the government to issue public notices asking the public to submit to the Claims Commissioner, the video and other recordings related to damages caused to the properties. The police and other authorities of the government too will have to submit video recordings of damages caused to public and private properties. While directing the government to provide all necessary infrastructure and staff to the Claims Commissioner, the Bench asked the government to appoint valuers to access the damages as per the decision of the Claims Commissioner. Intimation to Centre While clarifying that it is not considering the merits of allegations made in the First Information Reports (FIRs) at this stage, the Bench directed the State government to inform whether invoking the provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act was intimated to the Central government as per Section 6 of the National Investigation Agency Act 2008. Earlier, Advocate-General Prabhuling K. Navadgi told the Bench that provisions of the UAPA Act have been invoked in two FIRs and these cases are transferred to Central Crime Branch for investigation The A-G also said the State government would like to file objection to the PIL petition seeking transfer of the probe to the NIA while asserting that the government is committed to conduct probe in a fair and transparent manner. One of the petitioners, N.P. Amruthesh, has alleged that Pulakeshinagar MLA Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy, whose house has been damaged in the violence, has been visiting the police station and the office of the Commissioner of Police and such interference by the MLA could not be allowed. The transfer of probe to an independent agency is essential in this case as a large number of police are victims in the violence, it was argued behalf of another petitioner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/claims-commissioner-appointed-to-assess-damage/article32470420.ece
29 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Ganapathy case: Special Court rejects closure report||The Special Court to exclusively deal with criminal cases related to elected MPs/MLAs in Karnataka on Friday rejected the closure report filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on the case registered against former Minister K.J. George and senior IPS officers A.M. Prasad and Pronab Mohanty for allegedly abetting Dy.SP M.K Ganapathy to commit suicide. The Special Court also took cognisance of the offence against Mr. George, Mr. Prasad and Mr. Mohanty and ordered for issue of summons, while adjourning further proceedings. T.N. Inavally, judge of the Special Court, said in his order that “...there is prima facie material against the accused persons to take cognisance of the offence punishable under Sec.306 of the Indian Penal Code and proceed against them.” Parents’ plea Ganapathy’s parents M.K Kushalappa and M. Ponnamma and others had opposed the CBI’s closure report. The Special Court rejected the opinion of the CBI investigation officer that all the instances, referred to by Ganapathy during his interview to the media prior to ending his life, happened long ago and there is no immediate proximity between the suicide and the instances (connected to the three accused) presented in the interview. The question as to whether the facts stated by the deceased to the media are true or false and whether the interview to media can be considered as a death note are to be considered on merits during trial, the Special Court said. Though Ganapathy was not directly working under the three accused persons at the time of ending his life, the Special Court said there are materials, though dated five to seven years ago, in the form of statements linking Ganapathy with the accused. The statements recorded by the investigation officer shows that handling of an incident of attack on a church in Mangaluru in 2008, when Ganapathy was serving as jurisdictional police officer, links to Mr. George when he became Home Minister in 2013, the Special Court said. Also, the Special Court noted that statements shows that Ganapathy had declined to do a favour to Mr. Prasad to help the latter’s son, who was pursuing engineering (during 2006-10) in Udupi district. The allegation that Mr. Mohanty had demanded money from Ganapathy was related to the period when both Mr. Mohanty and Ganapathy were serving in Bengaluru city, the Special Court noted, while holding that there is a need to find out whether there was continuous “harassment” by the accused persons though there was no immediate connection between Ganapathy and them. Ganapathy died on July 7, 2016, and police registered only an unnatural death case. However, FIR was registered for abetting suicide based on a private complaint filed by Ganapathy’s son. Later, investigation was transferred to CID, which in September 2016 filed closure report stating that no case had been made out against the accused. However, the Supreme Court on September 5, 2017, ordered probe by the CBI, which filed the closure report on October 30, 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ganapathy-case-special-court-rejects-closure-report/article32470430.ece

29 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Mega e-Lok Adalats to be held across Karnataka on Sept. 19||After virtual sittings of courts, Karnataka will now witness a mega e-Lok Adalat on September 19 at the taluk, district and High Court-level to settle cases through virtual mode as it is not possible to hold regular Lok Adalats due to COVID-19 restrictions. Addressing mediapersons on Friday, Justice Aravind Kumar, judge of High Court and executive chairperson of the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority (KSLSA), said both litigants and their lawyers can approach the respective courts or the legal services authorities for referring their cases for settlement through e-Lok Adalats. Justice Kumar pointed out that not holding regular Lok Adalats since April had not only affected the litigants who were unable to exercise the right to settle their cases amicably through alternative dispute resolution mode, but had also impacted the livelihood of advocates. He said that the mega e-Lok Adalats were being organised keeping in mind the interests of litigants and advocates. He also said that several rounds of talks were held with the stakeholders, including the Karnataka State Bar Council, on holding the adalats and lawyers had agreed to cooperate with KSLSA and HC. Hundreds of cases had been identified for referring for settlement through e-Lok Adalat proceeding to be held through videoconferencing, which could be attended by the lawyers and the litigants from their respective locations, said Justice Kumar, adding that nearly 3,700 cases, pending in three Benches of the High Court in Bengaluru, Kalaburagi and Dharwad had been identified. Justice Alok Aradhe, judge of the High Court and chairperson of the High Court’s Legal Services Committee, said that e-Lok Adalats at the micro level would make an attempt to settle motor vehicle accident compensation, compoundable criminal cases, cheque bounce cases, and family court matters (except divorce cases) as per the SOP devised for the purpose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mega-e-lok-adalats-to-be-held-across-karnataka-on-sept-19/article32470429.ece
29 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Centre willing to hand over BGML land for industrial park’||The Union government will hand over 3,200 acres of land, belonging to the defunct Bharat Gold Mines Limited (BGML), in Kolar to the Karnataka government for developing an industrial park, if no minerals are found during a survey to be conducted over the next six months, said Union Coal and Mines Minister Pralhad Joshi on Friday. Mr. Joshi said that he had requested the State government to conduct a physical survey within three months. The Centre, through Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd., will identify areas that have not been explored for natural minerals within six months. After the survey, if the land parcel does not possess any natural resources, then the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB) would obtain the land from the Ministry of Mines with necessary approvals to set up the park. The land is strategically located 90 km from the Bengaluru airport, 260 km from the Chennai Port, and 314 km from the Krishnapatnam Port, Mr Joshi said. If any gold, palladium or tungsten are found during the survey, the State government will auction it and get royalty, Mr. Joshi said. Major and Medium Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar said the department had given a proposal seeking 3,200 acres of BGML land for developing the park. “We held talks with Mr. Joshi to obtain the unused land at BGML for the park,” Mr. Shettar said. The State has been pursuing the Centre to use the land of the BGML to develop a second industrial node on the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor. BGML, which operated the Kolar Gold Fields (KFG) and was closed in 2001, has about 12,000 acres of land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/centre-willing-to-hand-over-bgml-land-for-industrial-park/article32470478.ece
29 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Too much screen time? You may be facing digital burnout||The pandemic has changed the way many people work and most professionals spend the better part of the day switching from one chat window to another during online meetings and attending webinars. Spending such a large chunk of the day in front of the screen may have an adverse effect. Mental health experts point out that working professionals who are adapting to the “new normal” during the pandemic may be facing a digital burnout. Researchers from the Service for Healthy use of Technology (SHUT) clinic at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) have published a paper on this in the ‘World Social Psychiatry’, the peer-reviewed journal of the World Association of Social Psychiatry. In the paper titled ‘Digital Burnout: COVID-19 Lockdown Mediates Excessive Technology Use Stress’, researchers say that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the time spent digitally had increased enormously for both work- and leisure-related activities. Researchers interviewed around 70 working professionals in the age group of 25 to 45 from across different sectors, including software and marketing professionals as well as those in the administrative roles in the government sector. Respondents said that the time spent on online streaming platforms, gaming, and social media too had increased multifold. Manoj Kumar Sharma, who heads the SHUT clinic, said the excessive screen time had led to digital burnout. Respondents felt physically or psychologically exhausted and were not satisfied with their productivity. “Lack of physical interaction with their colleagues along with digital burnout had severely affected the motivation levels of employees,” he said. ‘Not a medical condition’ He, however, cautioned that digital burnout cannot be classified as a medical condition, but needs to be viewed as an occupational phenomenon.  Those interviewed also pointed out that online meetings required them to be more attentive than face-to-face meetings. Many of them complained that if their colleagues logged in even a few minutes late, it irked them. They also said that the phenomenon of being “permanently online” contributed to their stress.  The paper has noted that working professionals are finding it hard to maintain a balance between time spent on online and offline activities. “Digital hygiene — in the form of taking frequent breaks from screen use, structured hours for online office work, demarcated time for online leisure activities, engagement in indoor physical activities, secure time spent for offline communication with family members, stopping use of digital devices and online activities one hour before sleep time, and avoiding caffeine use to delay sleep time — can help one from experiencing digital burnout,” wrote the researchers in the paper. Dr. Sharma also said that implementing digital hygiene activities would help in minimising the risk of developing digital burnout.

The validity of documents, which lapsed from February 1, 2020, has been extended till December 31. In another decision, the government has also deferred the payment of road tax dues originally scheduled for August 15 to September 15, till September 30, 2020. The order states that owners can pay the tax without penalty till September-end. However, the relaxation does not apply to the registration of new vehicles. The decision on deferring the collection of road tax till September has not gone down well with travel operators. Radhakrishna Holla, president of the Karnataka State Travel Operators’ Association said, “The Karnataka government should take a cue from other governments such as Maharashtra and Gujarat and waive the tax. The operators are going through a tough time without any business. Instead of deferring payment of road tax, it should waive the tax till December”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-govt-extends-validity-of-vehicle-documents-till-december-31/article32470481.ece

Chairing the review meeting of the Labour Department at the Deputy Commissioner’s office in Dharwad on Friday, Mr. Hebbar said that apart from organising welfare programmes for workers of the unorganised sector and migrant labourers, the department would also be collecting data pertaining to the workers. Mr. Hebbar said that in the legislature session, Bill on a new law that would ensure protection to the workers of the unorganised sector would be tabled. He emphasised that the Labour Department was working as a bridge between workers and owners of industries. He said it was unfortunate that lots of jobs had been lost due to COVID-19 and the condition of the working class had worsened. Considering this, the department was taking steps to mitigate their sufferings, he said. Claiming that the new industrial policy would solve the problems of the workers, the Minister said the department was contemplating on constructing residential schools in industrial estates. Mr. Hebbar said senior officials of the department had been deputed to visit and conduct a study of labour welfare programmes implemented in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Based on the report, more welfare programmes would be chalked out, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/new-bill-for-unorganised-sector-to-be-tabled-hebbar/article32470440.ece
29 August 2020||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Polytechnic takes up project to conserve native ‘Hassan sheep’||The Animal Husbandry Polytechnic at Koravangala near Hassan, a unit of the Karnataka Veterinary, Animal and Fisheries Sciences University at Bidar, has taken up the task to conserve the ‘Hassan sheep’, a breed native to the region which has been on the decline in recent years. Its campus off the Hassan-Arsikere Road now hosts a herd of around 80 sheep. The project is being sponsored by the State government. Among other things, the project aims to develop a farm of about 250 such sheep to establish a sperm bank and to encourage farmers to rear the breed through artificial insemination. The staff of the college had gone around Hassan, Channarayapatna, Arsikere taluks, and purchased some animals. R. Guruprasad, Principal of the college and principal investigator of the project, told The Hindu , “This breed has been recognised by the National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources. Because it is found only in three-four taluks of Hassan district, the breed must have some features specific to this climatic condition”. A.S. Jayanna, an expert adviser of the project, said, “The sheep will be taken from one area to another in a day so that they get all essential nutrients. We have developed a protein park for them”. The college offers a two-year course in Animal Husbandry for Class 10 students. At present, 89 students are studying in the college. This project has also helped students gain knowledge about sheep rearing, added Mr. Jayanna.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/polytechnic-takes-up-project-to-conserve-native-hassan-sheep/article32470473.ece
29 August 2020||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Five arrested with Hippopotamus ivory||Forest Department officials of Shivamogga have arrested five persons, including two from Goa, on charges of illegally transporting the ivory of Hippopotamus, not found in India. The accused reportedly took the ivory weighing about 11 kg from an old lady in Goa and transported it to Shivamogga hoping to find a suitable buyer. It all began with the Shivamogga Vigilance Wing of the Forest Department, led by ACF Balachandra H.C., conducting a raid at Chandragutti village in Sorab taluk on Monday. The officers had information about a group of people trying to sell ivory. The officers arrested Zakir Khan, 30, of Chandragutti, Muzaffar Hassan, 19, of Honnavara, and Mohammed Danish, 32, of Bhatkal with the ivory. R. Ravishankar, Conservator of Forests, on Friday, told the media: “We could see that it was Hippopotamus ivory. The animal is not found in India. The three arrested were sent to judicial custody.

Their vehicles were also seized. From Tanzania “During the interrogation, we found that the accused got the ivory from a lady in Goa. The two accused, who were helping the lady clean the house, found the ivory. They took it from her and contacted Mohammed Danish to find a buyer in Karnataka,” Mr. Ravishankar said. As per the information collected from the lady, her father was working in Tanzania and he had brought the ivory to Goa in the 1960s. “We are sending the sample of the ivory to a laboratory to ascertain its age through carbon dating,” Mr. Ravishankar said. He appreciated the investigating officers and thanked the officers in Goa for their cooperation.  The accused reportedly took the ivory weighing about 11 kg from a lady in Goa and transported it to Shivamogga hoping to find a suitable buyer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/five-arrested-with-hippopotamus-ivory/article32470431.ece

29 August 2020||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Workers, poor not benefiting from ESI hospitals to the desired level: Minister||Labour Minister Shivaram Hebbar has said that although the State government was spending Rs. 450 crore annually for supplying quality medicines to seven ESI hospitals and 113 ESI clinics in the State, it was regrettable that workers and the poor were not benefiting to the expected level. Speaking to presspersons after visiting the ESI Hospital on Karwar Road in Hubballi on Friday, Mr. Hebbar said that, despite having an ESI Hospital in Hubballi, the government was paying Rs. 3.5 crore annually for treatment of employees under the ESI scheme to private hospitals as the hospital lacked infrastructure and the required medical staff. “In fact, if we spend Rs. 6 crore to Rs. 8 crore, the ESI Hospital in Hubballi will have the required infrastructure to provide all necessary treatments. Shortly, the hospital will be provided with all necessary medical equipment and infrastructure. The issue of appointment of speciality doctors, surgeons and paramedical staff will also be finalised in a meeting to be held in Bengaluru on September 4 and 5,” he said.Mr. Hebbar added that once the facilities at the ESI Hospital were improved and the required staff provided, the practice of referring patients to private hospitals would automatically stop. He said that the State government was paying private hospitals directly nearly Rs. 42 crore annually for treatment of beneficiaries of ESI scheme. The Minister said that he had already toured 21 districts in the State and visited ESI hospitals and clinics and had interacted with doctors and patients. He said that a total of 150 doctors had been newly appointed and 11 among them would be deputed to work at the ESI Hospital in Hubballi. Mr. Hebbar said that there was no rule that poor workers who did not have ESI cards should not be given treatment and medicines at ESI hospitals. “I will speak to the Union Labour Minister urging him to allow treatment for the poor in ESI hospitals. Public money is given to ESI hospitals but there are some complex regulations and they would be sorted out,” he said. The Minister was accompanied by Member of Legislative Assembly Prasad Abbayya, Labour Commissioner Akram Pasha, Medical Superintendent Suresh K., Regional Labour Commissioner from Belagavi Venkatesh Sindihatti and others. Mr. Hebbar interacted with doctors and paramedical staff, heard their grievances and also inspected the various facilities. Inspection The Minister also visited the Karmika Bhavan which is under construction at Akshay Nagar in Hubballi and reviewed the progress of work. A grant of Rs. 10 crore has been provided of which Rs. 6.5 crore has been spent for the G + 2 floors building, while Rs. 1.5 crore is being spent for fire safety measures. The officials informed the Minister that the work is likely to be completed in the next two months. Mr. Hebbar directed the officials to get another floor constructed in the same building to accommodate all the wings of the Labour Department and take steps to get the building ready for inauguration by January 1, 2021. He also asked them to set up a Labour Helpline facility on the ground floor of the building.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/workers-poor-not-benefiting-from-esi-hospitals-to-the-desired-level-minister/article32470662.ece

29 August 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Forest Department submits proposal to widen Kaniyanapura elephant corridor||The Forest Department has submitted a proposal to the State government to purchase 106 acres of land around Bandipur Tiger Reserve from farmers of the region who are keen to sell it in a bid to avoid recurring conflict and crop loss due to depredation. If approved, it will help widen Kaniyanapura elephant corridor and pave way for the smooth passage of elephants from Bandipur to Mudumalai without disturbance. Though this is a long-pending offer from the farmers which has not materialised so far, this is the first time that the Forest Department has forwarded a proposal to complete the transaction in the interest of farmers and wildlife. The proposal to the State government to acquire 106 acres of land in and around Kaniyanapura was made early this month. R. Balachandra, director, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, told The Hindu that acquisition will be a win-win situation for both farmers and elephants. “Farmers can live in peace without the fear of crop loss while the widening of the only elephant corridor will provide the wild elephants a smooth passage from one forest area to another’’ said Balachandra. The farmers of the region have offered to surrender nearly 300 acres of land of which records pertaining to 106 acres are in order. There are legal ramifications with regard to another 200 acres and the documents have been forwarded to the legal cell of the government for verification and opinion. This pertains to land allotted to SC/ST communities whose ownership cannot be changed as per the Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) Act 1978. The Forest Department requires about 500 to 600 acres of land for expanding the existing corridor. But, Mr. Balachandra said they should go ahead with purchase of 106 acres as the records were in order and farmers were keen to surrender it. “The discussion pertaining to compensation and fixing the land rate will take place at the highest level though we have urged the government to expedite the process in the interest of farmers and wildlife,” said Mr. Balachandra. If the exchange of land is approved, the ownership will be transferred to the Forest Department which will allow it to be reclaimed by the adjoining forests and the landscape will be part of the existing Kaniyanapura corridor, the official added. Kaniyanapura elephant corridor has been identified as a priority 1 elephant corridor by wildlife experts in view of its ecological importance. At present, the corridor has a maximum width of about 500 m beyond which are private lands, revenue land and villages with human habitation which disturb elephant movement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/forest-department-submits-proposal-to-widen-kaniyanapura-elephant-corridor/article32470435.ece
29 August 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Will festivities be confined to palace premises?||All eyes are on the Dasara High Power Committee, which is expected to meet in Bengaluru soon to finalise the format of the festivities amid the pandemic. The big questions are whether the Vijayadashami procession be confined to the century-old Ambavilas Palace instead of the usual 4-km-long route (Raja Marga), and if the entire elephant contingent will participate. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has said that Mysuru Dasara will be a low-key affair this year. The government is expected to make its stand clear by next week on how the event would be celebrated. Sources told The Hindu that senior officials from Mysuru would be making a presentation before the Chief Minister in the meeting to be attended by Minister in charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar, Minister for Tourism C.T. Ravi and others. In the past, the celebrations had been scaled down for various reasons, including drought, floods, natural calamities, kidnap of Dr. Rajkumar by forest brigand Veerappan and farmers’ suicides. There is an example of Jamboo Savari being confined to the palace premises during a low-key Dasara. Mysuru Dasara, or the ‘Nada Habba’, has been a crowd-puller, but it is unlikely to be so this time. Even the stakeholders of the tourism sector have welcomed the government’s move to keep the event low-key. Mysuru Hotel Owners’ Association Narayana Gowda said, “In the interest of public health, let the Dasara remain a traditional one this year instead of organising the event on a large scale since social distancing would be difficult to maintain.” In a letter, Federation of Farmers’ Association Kurubur Shanthkumar urged the Chief Minister to reconsider holding Dasara and Panchalinga Darshana festivities in view of the pandemic. The money proposed to be spent on the two events can be used for treating patients and strengthening hospitals, he suggested. Sources in the Forest Department told The Hindu that the department had not received any communication so far on selecting Dasara elephants and also on Gajapayana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/will-festivities-be-confined-to-palace-premises/article32470416.ece

29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||BDA to hold virtual consultation on Peripheral Ring Road on Sept. 3||After poor response to the first public consultation on the Peripheral Ring Road (PRR) due to confusion over the event itself and the fact that the venue was away from the city centre, the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) has announced a virtual consultation on September 3 at noon. The authority, in a press release issued on Friday, said that the public can participate by using Zoom. “The meeting ID and passcode will be published on the official website of the BDA and website of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB),” said the BDA. People can also send their suggestions and comments to eebdaprr@gmail.com on or before September 19. On August 18, the BDA held the first public consultation. However, due to the pandemic, the meeting received poor response. Prior to the public consultation, activists and some elected representatives had demanded that the BDA postpone the consultation. Despite the opposition, the BDA went ahead with the meeting. To save residential apartments at Seegehalli, the BDA has changed the alignment of the PRR. BDA Commissioner H.R. Mahadeva told The Hindu that residential apartments having more than 1,500 flats will be spared from acquisition and demolition. The change in alignment will help the BDA save close to Rs. 2,000 crore that is required for acquisition of the residential apartments. “Acquiring these properties is a cumbersome process, which will cause delays. Instead, agricultural land will be acquired. Alignment in the area has been changed by taking a detour for a distance of one km. The subject of change in alignment will be placed before the Board for approval,” said Mr. Mahadeva. In 2007-08, primary and final notifications were issued for 1,800 acres needed to be acquired for the project barring 79 acres. The project requires additional 795 acres for integration with NICE Road, toll plazas and other purposes. “Notification for the additional land will be issued in the coming days,” he added. The PRR is a controversial project for multiple reasons, especially its impact on the environment and ecosystem of lakes and catchment areas. More than 33,000 trees have been identified for removal to make way for the road. The construction of the road also needs more than 10 hectares of forest land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bda-to-hold-virtual-consultation-on-peripheral-ring-road-on-sept-3/article32470425.ece

Speaking to presspersons in Chikkamagaluru on Friday, he said there was no need for the protest even after Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s assurance to install the statue. “Sangolli Rayanna’s statue should be installed in Belagavi. The Chief Minister said the statue would be installed after clearing hurdles. But suddenly some people took out a protest on the issue. I suspect a political conspiracy behind this act, as in the case of violence in D.J. Halli in Bengaluru,” he said. Tipu controversy Reacting to MLC A.H. Vishwanath’s statement praising Tipu Sultan, Mr. Ravi said the former had read only half of Tipu’s history. “I wish he reads the complete history of Tipu Sultan,” he said. Equating Tipu and Hyder Ali with the British, Mr. Ravi said both were invaders. “I agree Tipu fought against the British. However, that does not mean he is our man.

29 August 2020||IDUKKI,KERALA||With Onam demand, Marayur jaggery price touches record high||With a spurt in demand, the price of Marayur jaggery has touched an all-time high this Onam. The price of a sack (50 kg) of Marayur jaggery on Thursday was Rs. 4,100 and agencies marketing the produce are finding it difficult to meet the demand. Selvin Mariappan of the Marayur Agriculture Producer Company, one of the three agencies marketing the jaggery, said the price rise was mainly due to demand from government and private agencies during the festival season. In addition to Horticorp, the Agriculture Department, which is running Onam markets, and cooperative banks had placed orders, he said adding the agency could meet only half the orders. “In view of the Onam season, the production was increased. Nearly a month ago, the highest price was Rs. 3,000 per sack and the increase in demand was due to the intervention of the government to supply Marayur jaggery in public markets,” he added. Maryur jaggery, produced in household units at Marayur and Kanthallur villages, is known for its quality. It is estimated that nearly 1,000 acres is under sugar cane cultivation in the two villages. Akbar Ali, who runs a jaggery unit at Marayur, said there was a palpable preference for natural and quality products now. The rise in demand in a short span had led to the rise in prices. However, there were chances of the price going down after the festival season. Mr. Ali said a steady market prompted by continuous procurement by agencies such as Supplyco could ensure a stable price. Selvaraj, a farmer, said the rise in prices would not benefit farmers as only a small quantity of the production was sold at that price now. “Jaggery production is done throughout the year and farmers cannot hold it over to get a price hike,” he added. There was a fall in production post lockdown as sugar cane farms had been left unharvested due to shortage of workers. The unexpected rise in prices would not benefit the farmers who had already harvested their crop, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/with-onam-demand-marayur-jaggery-price-touches-record-high/article32470754.ece

The police caned the protesters to disperse them when they tried to break the barricade erected across the DPC’s office road. Nine Congress activists, including Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee executive member N.D. Appachan and Youth Congress district president Shamsad Marakkar, were injured in the incident and were hospitalised. A team of Congress leaders led by District Congress Committee president I.C. Balakrishnan, MLA, staged a sit-in protest on the road against the police action. Later, District Police Chief R. Ilango held a discussion with the leaders and assured them of action against the police officials responsible. Scuffle in Kozhikode A march taken out by Youth Congress workers to the District Police Chief’s office seeking the resignation of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan over the gold smuggling case ended up in a street scuffle with the police on Friday. The police fired tear-gas shells thrice to disperse activists who tried to cross barricades. Some of the protesters also resorted to stone-pelting, which blocked the Kozhikode-Kannur road. However, no one sustained serious injuries. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary N. Subrahmanyan inaugurated the protest march. He alleged that files kept at the Secretariat were set afire purposefully to scuttle the ongoing NIA investigation into the gold smuggling case and save the image of the government. “A comprehensive investigation should be conducted into the incident as it was done with an aim to save many suspects in the case and cut their links with the top government functionaries,” he claimed. Youth Congress district president R. Shaheen presided over the protest meet. Senior Congress leaders were also present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/youth-congress-march-turns-violent-in-wayanad-9-injured/article32470720.ece

Mr. Chennithala, who inspected the bridge on the day, said that he would file a complaint with the Central Vigilance Commission seeking a proper investigation. “When the State government boats about its achievements, it should also own up the responsibility when such incidents take place,” he said. However, the State government was now passing the blame on to the Centre. The collapse of the girders showed that there had been carelessness. Any malpractice or flaws in the construction should be investigated, he said. K. Sudhakaran and K. Muraleedharan, MPs, who too visited the site, demanded an investigation into the incident. Negligence, says report The girders of the bridge collapsed due to negligence, a report submitted by project director Nirmal Sathi to the National Highways Authority has said. Reconstruction would be done at the expense of the contractor as the incident happened due to carelessness, the report said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/girder-collapse-issue-to-be-taken-up-with-cvc/article32470718.ece

The activists were demanding the resignation of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan alleging his role in the blaze at the Secretariat and an end to police violence against Youth Congress workers. The march, which started from the District Congress Committee (DCC) office, was stopped by a police barricade near the Jimmy George Hall near the toffice. The activist alleged that the police used water cannons on them without any provocation. Many activists were severely beaten up by the police. The injured workers were admitted to a private hospital. DCC president Satheeshan Pacheni protested against the police action, which led to several youth workers getting injured. He said that when the youth workers were protesting against the ‘anti-people actions’ of the government, the police degrading themselves to protect the government was inappropriate. A protest march taken out by Youth Congress activists to the office of the SP at Kalpetta in Wayanand on Friday turned violent. The police caned the protesters to disperse them when they tried to break the barricade erected across a road. Nine Congress activists were hospitalised with injuries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/youth-congress-activists-injured-in-lathicharge/article32470756.ece

Terminals are already under construction on the Vyttila Mobility Hub premises and at Kakkanad. They will also have commercial space to garner non-ticketing revenue. “Private land will have to be acquired for constructing a terminal at Eroor, located midway between Vyttila and Kakkanad. This will be readied once ferries begin operating between the two terminals. All terminals will have floating pontoons, so that commuters can safely board or disembark from ferries, irrespective of tidal variations. Care will be taken to ensure that all infrastructure is disabled-friendly as well,” said official sources. Dredging is currently under way on the route to ensure optimal depth along the waterway. The possibility of more terminals on the route will be probed, depending on passenger patronage. The travel time has been envisaged as 20 minutes. The KMRL is keen to limit the number of terminals, since they are capital-intensive like metro-rail stations, having automatic gates and other amenities for passengers. The ticket fare and frequency of services will be decided in the coming months. All 23 ferries in the first phase of Water Metro, each capable of accommodating 100 passengers and to be built by the Cochin Shipyard, will be introduced by the third quarter of 2021. Four more ferries will be rolled out in March, and subsequently in lots of four every two months. The number will increase to five for the last two batches. Cheranallore route After their launch on the Vyttila-Kakkanad route, ferries will begin operating on the High Court-Cheranallore/Eloor route, from March. Terminals in those routes are being readied. This will be followed by the High Court-Bolghatty Island-Vypeen route.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/water-metro-ferries-to-operate-regular-trips-from-march-2021/article32470732.ece
29 August 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Most migrant workers not part of trade unions, finds survey||Over 95% of migrant workers in Ernakulam remain deprived of their right to collective bargaining at workplaces, exposing the failure of trade unions in the State. This was revealed by a recent study on migrant workers in the district organised by Welfare Services Ernakulam with the financial and technical assistance of Caritas India and Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development (CMID) respectively. The study urged trade unions to take proactive steps to include migrants in their fold. Out of the 426 migrants covered as part of the study between November 18, 2019 and January 2, only 4.7% had trade unions membership. While 19.5% of migrants from Tamil Nadu were members of trade unions, the corresponding figure for workers from West Bengal and Assam was a meagre 1.1% each. Murshidabad in West Bengal and Nagaon in Assam remain the two biggest contributors of migrant workers to Ernakulam with 30.30% and 17.80% respectively. The district also accounts for a significant number of workers from Tamil Nadu and Odisha. While men largely dominate the migrant force in the district, women from Tamil Nadu at 42.50% far outnumber their counterparts from other States. Nearly 57% of migrant workers are from socially and economically disadvantaged classes with limited employment opportunities beyond agriculture or agricultural labour back home. ‘Most vulnerable’ Interestingly, 73.10% out of the 89.70% married migrants from Tamil Nadu leave their children back home in an attempt to maximise income and minimise expenses. “Tamilians, contrary to popular perception, remain one of the most vulnerable migrant communities in the district and nearly 75% of them are landless and about 31% are staring at debts. “However, in the face of dominant narrative about migrants being mostly from West Bengal, their plight is being overlooked,” said Benoy Peter, executive director, CMID. The construction sector remains the largest employer of migrants with nearly 49% of them working in the field, followed by the plywood sector with 27.20%. Migrant workers from Tamil Nadu at nearly 80% dominate the construction sector while migrants from Assam have a stranglehold in the highly skilled plywood sector with nearly 83% participation. Labour migration to Ernakulam remains almost entirely driven by informal social ties of the migrant workers who clock on an average of nine hours a day with an average monthly income of Rs. 15,000. Over 45% of workers are paid weekly while 39.20% are paid on a daily basis. While 65.40% of total migrant workforce are paid by employers, contractors pay an overwhelmingly 57.60% of Tamil Nadu migrants. Financial inclusion Financial inclusion remains the poorest among migrants from Assam, out of which nearly 31% do not have a bank or post office account. Not a single migrant has either heard or enrolled under the Inter-State Migrant Worker Welfare Scheme, indicating scant reach of institutional welfare schemes. Nearly 39% of migrant workers smoke and 28.90% use pan masala. Despite being highly vulnerable to accidents, injuries and diseases, only 11.50% opt for hospitalisation since most of them have to depend on private hospitals and bear expenses on their own.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/most-migrant-workers-not-part-of-trade-unions-finds-survey/article32470748.ece

The first flight, AI 1186 that arrived at the Cochin International Airport with 130 passengers on Friday, was received with a water salute. To promote direct connectivity to Europe, the airport has waived the landing fee for airlines operating direct services to Kochi from Europe. A spokesperson said that the decision would attract more airlines to operate services to Europe and the waiver would also reflect in the ticket prices. Air India has scheduled direct London-Kochi flights on Fridays and Sundays till September 27, as part of Vande Bharat Mission. When the first flight landed, a “follow me” vehicle service was facilitated by CIAL and as the aircraft entered the taxiway link, the fire tenders of CIAL Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting team rendered a water salute. The return flight departed at 0630 a.m. with 229 passengers. The Sunday flight is scheduled to arrive at 0015 hours and depart at 1220 the same day. Air India also operates flights from Australia and the U.S. to Kochi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/air-india-begins-direct-flights-to-london/article32470736.ece
29 August 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Now, Navy to recycle plastic waste on its premises||The Southern Naval Command (SNC) here will become self-sufficient in managing plastic waste from Saturday, with a full-fledged plant getting ready on its premises to recycle the refuse into reusable pellets. This would mean that zero plastic waste went out of the Naval Base, which already has incinerators to treat non-biodegradable waste and vermicompost pits for biodegradable waste at Kataribagh. Kitchen waste goes to piggeries, said Cmde N.A.J. Joseph, Commanding Officer of INS Venduruthy. Naval authorities began to search for way out, since there was no means to treat plastic waste, while the rest of the non-biodegradable waste went into incinerators. Vice Admiral Anil Kumar Chawla, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of SNC, took up the issue with District Collector S. Suhas, following which he and Cmde Joseph took up the project with Cochin Shipyard, which sanctioned Rs. 46 lakh to procure the machinery needed for recycling. The Navy spent funds for civil work, power and water, while the project was executed by the Kannur-based PSU, Steel Industries Limited-Kerala (SILK), with help from the district administration. Segregation “Civic agencies could think of such ventures, based on the outcome of the project. The facility would recycle plastic waste from nearby Vathuruthy area too,” Cmde Joseph said. Elaborating on the processes involved, he spoke of how waste would be further segregated into soft and hard plastic refuse. Dust would be removed from soft plastic, following which it would be washed and cleaned and fed into the grinding machine. “The hard plastic waste is dumped into a grinding machine, then to a washing machine and treated in a drier machine. Further processing the waste in a pelletising machine will ensure more resale value for the recycled plastic.” Manure from the vermicompost pit is sold at subsidised rate, mainly to Navy personnel. It was also offered to Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL). Efforts are under way to zero in on a means to handle thermocol waste. In December, the SNC organised a “Plastic Se Raksha - Swachhta Hi Suraksha” plogging campaign. A “garbage water scooper” made indigenously by the Naval Ship Repair Yard was used to clear the main channel of plastic and other waste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/now-navy-to-recycle-plastic-waste-on-its-premises/article32470730.ece

Though Onam was still five months away then, the police officers chose the format of Thiruvathirakali or Kaikottikali, a dance form largely associated with the festival. That the dance was usually the domain of women did not stop the male cops from performing it. While the 12-minute video was uploaded on YouTube and police officers at the jail shared it through their social media accounts, it was far from being a hit like the ‘handwashing dance’. However, six months down the line, the video has received a second lease of life as it is getting widely shared on social media. “It is probably because Onam is around the corner and people now relate more with it as Thiruvathirakali is mostly performed during these times,” said Prabhan T., who then served as gatekeeper at the district jail and penned the lyrics. “It was completely impromptu and the writing of lyrics and the choreography was all wrapped up in less than 30 minutes. It was done with the cops who were on duty at that point of time,” said Mr. Prabhan, who is now assistant superintendent at a special sub-jail in Thiruvananthapuram. He claimed that the video has received over 50,000 views and numerous shares through multiple social media accounts, including WhatsApp groups.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/five-months-on-cops-video-gets-social-media-attention/article32470738.ece

The State government had exempted buses which operate as stage/ contract carriages and also school buses from paying the quarterly tax amount, irrespective of whether they operated service or not. Hit by lockdown Most of those who did not operate service for months on end due to the lockdown had submitted G-form to the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD), which exempt them from paying tax, provided they did not operate trips. Highlighting the plight of taxi and tour operators, C.P. Ajith Kumar, owner of a city based travels, said that vehicles in the taxi segment that had seven seats ended up paying Rs. 3,500 as road tax every quarter, whether they operated service or not. The amount was higher for large vehicles. Mr. Kumar said that at least 50% of taxi drivers had invested in their vehicles. They were doubly affected, as they had to pay EMI for their vehicle and also road tax and other mandatory payments. All this when they were devoid of any source of revenue. Sources in the MVD said that the taxi/travel sector had been hit by the slowdown. Refund “The operators can choose to get a refund of the tax they paid, if they adduce proof that the vehicle did not operate. But it is a cumbersome process and they will have to repeatedly visit three government offices, including the treasury. Subsequently, only fleet operators chose the option, with individual owners resigned to their fate,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/taxi-operators-in-a-quandary-over-road-tax/article32470745.ece

On Thursday’s enforcement alone, the MVD squad collected a fine of Rs. 95, 000 in 86 different cases. Drunk driving, helmetless ride and underage driving will be dealt with strictly. Across the State, officials are also following strict verification of vehicle documents. The use of point-of-sales (POS) machines too is under the consideration of MVD squads in Kozhikode district. It will enable easy payment of fine using credit or debit cards. Also, the machines will help squads easily access details of vehicles and enter the types of violations for further proceedings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-mvd-intensify-vehicle-checks/article32470727.ece

The Congress leader was speaking after visiting the venue of the protest by Mahila Mall entrepreneurs against the closure of the mall on Friday. Many of the women entrepreneurs had invested lakhs of rupees for their ventures. However, their shops at the mall remain closed for the past five months. Govt. slammed Earlier, Mr. Chennnithala said that opposition parties had raised right allegations against the State government in the Assembly. However, the Chief Minister did not respond to any of these allegations. “The Chief Minister used his marathon speech only to read out a written script,” he said.

29 August 2020||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||Popular Finance fraud: MD’s daughters held||The probe into the alleged duping of depositors by Popular Finance at Vakayar, Pathanamthitta, took a new turn on Friday with the two daughters of the prime accused landing in police custody. Officials said Rinu Mariyam Thomas and Riya Ann Thomas, daughters of Thomas Daniel, managing director (MD), Popular Finance, were apprehended while attempting to flee the country from the Indira Gandhi international airport in New Delhi. The duo, who had reached the airport to board a flight to Australia, were apprehended based on a lookout circular issued by the police. A team led by Konni station house officer P.S. Rajesh reached Delhi and will bring them to Pathanamthitta upon obtaining a transit warrant. The police had earlier issued the lookout circular against eight persons, including Mr. Daniel, his wife, Prabha, and two daughters. Rs. 2,000 crore deposits The police said the company had collected deposits to the tune of around Rs. 2,000 crore from about 1,600 customers within and outside the country. The police have so far received about 400 complaints against the company. According to K.G. Simon, District Police Chief, the accused had been booked under Indian Penal Code Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention). The fraud first came to light a couple of weeks ago when the Konni police, based on a complaint, registered a cheating complaint against Mr. Daniel for failing to repay the deposits collected. As the number of complaints began to grow, the accused went into hiding after shutting down the registered office of the company at Vakayar. Amidst protests by the depositors and investigation by the police, Mr. Daniel moved an insolvency petition in a Pathanamthitta subcourt. The court is slated to consider the case on September 7. Popular Finance has been into the business of gold loans and taking deposits from people since 1965. The company has around 300 branches within and outside the State. Meanwhile, a subcourt in Pathanamthitta on Friday attached the head office of the company at Vakayar. The action followed a petition moved by K.V. Suresh, one of the depositors. Earlier in the day, hundreds of depositors, who had gathered at the registered office of the company, staged a protest seeking action against the company owners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/popular-finance-fraud-mds-daughters-held/article32470765.ece

29 August 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Siri Jagan panel faces govt. apathy||Four years after a Supreme Court-appointed committee to consider claims for compensation to victims of stray dog bites in the State was set up, it continues to suffer from government apathy. The three-member committee headed by S. Siri Jagan, a former judge of the High Court of Kerala, has received 2,496 claims for compensation so far. It has closed 456 claims, including those recommended for compensation. The highest claim awarded by the committee is for Rs. 20 lakh, to a Thiruvananthapuram boy who suffered a reaction from the rabies vaccine. However, the government has failed to provide infrastructure support to the committee or meet its administrative expenses despite repeated reminders. A letter sent to the Urban Affairs Director in February this year claimed Rs. 78,513 as postage and binding charges alone till December 31, 2019, not to mention other expenses. However, no contingency fund has been sanctioned, forcing the committee chairman who gets an honorarium to dip into his own pockets. “The committee sends at least four to six notices by registered post on each claim, and the postage fee comes to nearly Rs. 150. This is met by me. Requests for reimbursement to the government have fallen on deaf years,” says Mr. Siri Jagan. Binding expenses The committee also has binding expenses arising from sending its assessment on the claims to the Supreme Court. Twenty-six reports have been sent to the apex court so far. The committee, which holds sittings at district headquarters to receive and assess claims, does not receive any TA/DA either. It functions out of a room with a cabin for the chairman in Kochi. But it does not have an e-mail ID or official phone. There is no Wi-Fi connection in the officer either. One laptop is used by both the chairman and the secretary. The commission has requested for a desktop computer. Data on compensation paid to dog-bite victims is also not shared with the committee. “Once, on the Supreme Court’s direction, we called up the claimants individually, and sent a report. Those claims were paid. But we do not have any idea on how many claimants in all have been paid,” says Mr. Siri Jagan. “More than 90% of the victims claiming compensation are poor. Helping them is the sole reason I am carrying on the responsibility,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/siri-jagan-panel-faces-govt-apathy/article32470860.ece
29 August 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Pandemic puts a strain on Corpn. resources||With no compensation coming from the Central government this year for entertainment tax forgone, and tax collection only slowly picking up, the city Corporation has been digging deep into its own fund reserves to fund all its interventions to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. During this period of low revenues, the civic body has been forced to spend much more than it does during the usual times, for everything from the running of community kitchens to setting up institutional quarantine centres and COVID first-line treatment centres (FLTC) and disinfection activities in public places and institutions. Banking on own funds “We have been sitting somewhat safe because of the somewhat substantial own funds in reserve. During this period, we have spent almost half of it. In March, a major tax collection drive was supposed to happen, but the pandemic hit during that time. Now, the collection of building tax, professional tax and rents from our buildings as well as license fee are slowly picking up, as businesses have started running. The last time we got GST compensation for entertainment tax forgone was in 2018-19. We will get the GST for the various works done only after the contractors submit the bills,” said Deputy Mayor Rakhi Ravikumar. Contributions sought The financial crunch is evident in the fact that the city Corporation has been requesting for contributions from the public for providing food kits to the families in the coastal regions, which were hit by COVID-19 as well as the pandemic-induced lockdown and ban on fishing. The running of institutional quarantine centres and first-line treatment centres impose major strain on the local body’s finances, as it includes the cost of various materials provided, supply of food three times a day to all the residents and cleaning activities. In the initial days of the pandemic, the Corporation had also provided food packets free of cost to several residents, who had called up the community kitchens. Theatre owners’ plea With the theatre owners and others demanding a cut in GST once cinema theatres start functioning, it remains to be seen how much longer the Corporation will have to wait for adequate GST compensation, which would allow it to breathe free.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pandemic-puts-a-strain-on-corpn-resources/article32470866.ece

In a message issued on the occasion of Ayyankali jayanti here on Friday, he said the social reformer had been instrumental in leading Kerala from the dark ages to a modern civilised society and ensuring social justice for Dalits. “He made the oppressed classes aware of their rights and guided agricultural workers in their struggle against exploitation. He proved that the fight against casteism is equally a struggle against class exploitation,” Mr.Vijayan said.

29 August 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||TDB to monetise gold in temples||The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) has decided in principle to monetise the gold not used for daily temple rituals and which do not have antique value to tide over the crisis brought about by COVID-19. “The evaluation of the gold in the 1,250 temples under the administrative control of the board is on under Deputy Devaswom Commissioners. Valuation and indenting will take another month to know the exact quantity of gold that can be monetised,” N. Vasu, president, TDB, told The Hindu on Friday. The pandemic-induced lockdown for the past five months has led to the closure of temples and the loss is estimated to be around Rs. 300 crore. The initiative will help raise money and the cost of keeping the gold in safe custody can be avoided. RBI loan or scheme The TDB president said they were considering either pledging the gold with the Reserve Bank of India for a loan, depositing them under the Gold Monetisation Scheme, or both. Depositing them as gold bonds would yield an annual interest of 2.5% and this was the best offer before the board now. Mr. Vasu, who had attended the meeting of Devaswom boards convened by the Centre on August 22 to chalk out ways to tide over the crisis, said clarifications had been sought from the Union Finance Ministry on the loan and the gold scheme. The gold that was not being used for daily temple rituals, and which did not have antique value, would be pledged against the loans or used in the scheme. The gold would have to be melted, purified, and then deposited in the RBI. Pointing out that there was opposition from some quarters to the initiative, Mr. Vasu said the TDB would approach the High Court after evaluation of the gold and seek its permission to go ahead. The High Court has to grant permission for any high-value transaction by the Devaswom boards for non-temple utilisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tdb-to-monetise-gold-in-temples/article32470761.ece

The 18-minute audiovisual treat explains the variety of delicacies of the multi-course Sadya. The video premiere comes as part of an ongoing two-week-long virtual endeavour saluting the spirit of Onam. The run-up to the harvest festival is chiefly marked by 10 days of laying of the flower carpet to welcome Mahabali. The Tourism Department’s August 22-September 2 ‘Onam Fest Kerala’ features a bouquet of heritage arts and celebratory rituals alongside new-age cultural programmes — all of it online.

29 August 2020||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Agricultural advisory board bats for crop diversification||The first-ever agricultural advisory board meeting organised here on Friday resolved to discourage groundnut monocropping and promote crop diversification in the district, even as many people’s representatives and other stakeholders gave the programnme a miss. A G.O. was issued on July 14, mandating creation of a three-tier Agricultural Advisory Board at the State, district and mandal levels to advise farmers and the departments concerned on agro-climatic zones, crop diversification, suitable package practices and market intelligence among others. “Prior to the move, no proper mechanism was available to issue advisories on cropping patterns based on availability of irrigation facilities, agro-climatic conditions, and soil types. Agriculture officials had also been facing difficulties to keep a tab on cropping pattern and acreage at the village and mandal levels. The advisory boards now will put all such issues to rest,” said R&B Minister Malagundla Sankaranarayana, who chaired the meeting. Lakshmikantha Reddy from Rayadurg, interim chairman of the district board among 10 progressive farmers in the district took part in the meeting. However, no official from horticulture, irrigation, electricity departments, and a majority of MLAs, MLCs, both MPs from the district gave it a miss. MLAs Kapu Ramachandra Reddy, P.V. Sidda Reddy and Thopudurthi Prakash Reddy were the people’s representatives who were present . Collector Gandham Chandrudu initiated the proceedings. Joint Collector Nishant Kumar, the member convener, said the total sown area this kharif has doubled to 6.33 lakh hectares owing to good rain, when compared to that of last year. Action Fraterna Ecology Centre Director Y.V. Malla Reddy, a member the board, said, “Even as groundnut germination is good this time due to rain, it is deceptive as the crop in thousands of hectares sown in May and June failed to develop pods. Crop sown in July and August are facing problems owing to heavy rain.”  Value addition He suggested that cultivation of pulses and millets should be promoted and activities pertaining to value addition of millets should be undertaken to make the crops remunerative. A.P. Pattu Rythula Sangham representative from Hindupur Chaitanya Gangi Reddy sought a timetable for release of irrigation water and development of marketing strategies for farm and sericulture produce.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/agricultural-advisory-board-bats-for-crop-diversification/article32470393.ece

29 August 2020||B. Madhu Gopal,ANDHRA PRADESH||Plan to hold JEE, NEET evokes mixed response||The decision of the Centre to go ahead with the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) and National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) has evoked mixed response from aspirants and parents. While some expressed the view that holding examinations will help them overcome stress, others say that loss of an academic year is better than contracting the dreaded coronavirus. The Centre has announced its decision to hold the JEE Main from September 1 to 6 and NEET UG on Sept 13. The Congress and other Opposition parties have expressed their reservations against the decision and plan to jointly move the Supreme Court on the issue. While JEE Main is an online test, where students have to go to the designated centres to take the computer-based test in the six-day window period, NEET is offline test and will be held on a single day. It is estimated that about 30,000 students will be taking JEE Main and about 50,000 will appear for NEET. Earlier there were three centres for JEE Main and eight for NEET, it is learnt that keeping COVID in mind, the number of centres have been increased this time. Another major issue is transportation. Both for JEE and NEET, pver 50% of students are from rural areas who were hostellers and have gone back to their hometown, and now they have to reach the city at least a day before and stay in a hotel, as transport sector has not opened fully, said Ramalingeswara Rao, Director of Narayana College. The government has assured that all precautions will be taken as per COVID-19 protocols. Change of centre has also been allowed to enable students to take the examination at the centre nearest to them. However, some students express apprehensions on the probability of the family members of candidates being affected by the virus and chances of its spread through asymptomatic students at the examination halls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/plan-to-hold-jee-neet-evokes-mixed-response/article32470927.ece

Moreover, the activities such as distribution of essential commodities and provision of free meal have mostly been confined to urban areas. Many elderly persons, homeless people and the differently abled living in remote villages and tribal areas suffer as they are unable to get any support from neighbours and others whose income has come down due to lockdown. In this background, after observing their pathetic situation, a young couple started free meal service for nearly 30 destitutes in Vavilavalasa and Thatipadu villages of Regidi Amadalavalasa mandal of Srikakulam district. Interestingly, there has been no break for the service for the last six months when many organisations could not continue their services in the district. The young agriculturist and social worker, Paluri Siddharth, and wife Sudha Rani cook the food and serve them in the morning and in the evening. They spend around Rs. 1,500 everyday to provide free meal to the needy persons. “The income generated through agriculture activity and contributions from a few families are helping me to buy essential commodities for free meal service. Many women in the vicinity are also helping us in preparation of food. Their voluntary involvement is really laudable,” says Mr. Siddharth while speaking to The Hindu . “I have been helping seven orphan students to continue their study and it gives me immense satisfaction,” he adds. Recipient of awards Mr. Siddharth, aged 29, has got many awards for his previous service activities. He received the best social service award from the then Governor, E.S.L. Narasimhan. ‘AP Young Voter’ award has been presented to him in the year 2014 for his active role in enrolment of youngsters in the voter list.

Participating in the protest, Congress State general secretary D. Rambhupal Reddy expressed concern over the decision of conducting the examinations ‘at this crucial juncture ’. Curbs on travel “Coronavirus continues to take toll across the country. States such as Bihar and Assam are in the grip of flood. Students and their parents have been also appealing to the government to postpone the tests, but the Centre continues to turn a blind eye. Conducting examinations means playing with the lives of students,” said Mr. Reddy. Further, he said the curbs imposed in view of the pandemic would make it difficult for the students to travel hundreds of kilometres to reach their exam centres, he pointed out. Referring to the objections raised by half a dozen Chief Ministers in this regard, the Congress leaders demanded that the Centre postpon the tests in the larger interest of the students. Special Correspondent from Ongole adds: Meanwhile, the Congress activists staged a dharna on Ongole in support of the students. “It is not proper for the Centre to conduct the exams when a section of the students have contracted the infection and undergoing treatment,” said District Congress president Eda Sudhakar Reddy. Pradesh Congress spokesman Sk.Saida said it is the time the authorities intensified testing. “Shedding the adamant attitude, the Centre should postpone the examinations in the larger interests of the students. Will it take the responsibility of the safe transport of students to the examination centres and arrange food for them?” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/congress-opposes-move-to-conduct-jee-neet/article32470893.ece

They will have to identify a problem in the community and work out a solution to it,” explains Mr. Hemachandra Reddy. Interestingly, all government departments, whether it is the Collectorate, the tahsildar office, the Irrigation office, the APSRTC, or the AP Industrial Infrastructure Corporation will offer internship to the students. “A committee will be established under the chairmanship of the Collector, which will map the possible areas in the district. The Collector will be approached by the institutions seeking internship for their students,” Mr. Hemachandra Reddy explains. To enable the students to gain a hands-on experience, 20% of the courses have been converted into skill enhancement and skill development component. “The focus is on flexibility while designing the skill programmes with the active involvement of organisations such as the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) and BSNL,” he says. Referring to the credit exchange facility, he says that a student of college ‘X’ desiring to pursue a course of his interest offered by college ‘Y’ will be allowed to attend classes and take the exam in college ‘Y’ and carry the credits back to college ‘X’, where he or she will be counted in the total number of credits for awarding the degree. “The NEP also talks about credit bank,” he says. Importance has also been given to integration of society into the academia, he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/apsche-to-roll-out-renewed-curriculum/article32470908.ece
29 August 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rayalaseema lift scheme: State gets a shot in the arm||In what could be termed as a major relief to the State government, the Union government has submitted an affidavit before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) stating that prior environmental clearance was not required for the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme (RLIS). The Union Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF), in the affidavit filed on Friday, said that the RLIS does not attract the provisions of EIA 2006 notification. "The RLIS is not a new project and does not involve any additional culturable command area. It is neither the irrigation project nor the power generation component is involved. The project will also not qualify under expansion and modernisation of existing projects as for the purpose of fresh EC. So it can be inferred that the scheme does not fall under any category listed in the schedule of EIA notification," the Union government said. The NGT is hearing a petition filed by Gavinola Srinivas of Telangana seeking environmental clearances for the scheme. Advocate General Ramachandra Rao laid arguments on behalf of the Telangana government. It may be noted that the NGT had constituted a committee under the Union Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF), which had submitted a report stating that “ Prima facie requirement of prior environment clearance is not applicable” for the said project as it was not a new one and was only a supplementing mechanism to tap the assured share of Krishna water for the parched Rayalaseema districts. Following the report, the tribunal reserved its final order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rayalaseema-lift-scheme-state-gets-a-shot-in-the-arm/article32470904.ece

29 August 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||PIL filed against ‘diversion’ of Brahmin corp. funds||The High Court on Friday gave one week time to submit further documents to Chinta Umamaheswara Reddy, a Vijayawada-based advocate, who filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) against the alleged diversion of approximately Rs. 24.25 crore from the Brahmin Welfare Corporation to the Amma Vodi scheme. The two-Judge Bench, comprising Chief Justice J.K. Maheswari and Justice K. Lalitha Kumari, reportedly expressed displeasure at the petitioner, saying that it did not find any merit in his arguments and questioned why it should not dismiss the petition. This was when Mr. Umamaheswara Reddy sought seven days time to submit further documents in support of his charges. His contention was that the surplus funds, if any, available with the Endowments Department could not be spent for purposes other than those stipulated under Section72 of the Andhra Pradesh Charitable and Hindu Religious Institutions and Endowments Act, 1987. He said the government claimed to be utilising the funds for the welfare of Brahmins when the Act did not give preference to any particular section of the Hindus. Advocate-General S. Sriram argued that the Brahmin Welfare Corporation was not a part of the Endowments Department, and that G.O. RT No.18, dated January 6, 2020, through which the budgetary grant was made had not been filed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pil-filed-against-diversion-of-brahmin-corp-funds/article32470909.ece
29 August 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Two ships with ammonium nitrate barred entry||Based on an order from the Union government, two ships loaded with around 20,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate each, have been stopped from entering the Visakhapatnam port. One ship MV Kraszewski , bearing Cyprus flag, reached the anchorage on August 11 and is awaiting clearance and another MV East Ayutthuya with Thailand flag arrives on August 28. The order has come after Narsaraopet MP Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to stop import of ammonium nitrate and clear all stocks pending evacuation at all ports and warehouses. This has happened post the blast of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored at a warehouse in Beirut, Lebanon, on August 4 that left over 200 dead and over 6,000 injured. The blast was so severe that it was said to be one of the most powerful non-nuclear explosions in history and was said to have crossed 3.3 magnitude in a seismic event. According to reports, the blast could be felt 250 km away from the epicentre in Turkey, Syria, Israel, parts of Europe and Cyprus. Mr. Devarayalu pointed out that the blast in Beirut involved 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, but at a warehouse in Visakhapatnam, there is already a stock of over 18,000 tonnes and an additional 40,000 tonnes would increase the stock to over 50,000 tonnes, 20 times more than what was in Beirut. Location According to Director of the A.P. Chamber of Commerce and Industry O. Naresh Kumar, the positioning of the warehouse is precarious, as a number of important and strategic establishments such as International Airport, INS Dega (naval airbase), Coromandel Fertilizers, HPCL refinery and storage, Naval Armament Depot, Eastern Naval Command, NSTL, Hindustan Shipyard, Visakhapatnam port and a few others are located within 1 to 6 km radius. “We should not forget that ENC has two strategic nuclear submarines based within 2 to 3 km radius from the godown, and a minor mishap can flatten the entire city,” he said. Stress on audit Former Union Energy Secretary and social activist E.A.S. Sarma said that India imports close to 2.75 lakh tonnes of ammonium nitrate annually and of which 80% is done through Visakhapatnam port and stored in the warehouse of one CFS agent Sravan Shipping. At any point of time there is a stock of about 20,000 tonnes, and authorities concerned should do an audit to check the storage and transportation compliance. “Ammonium nitrate was classified as explosive material in 2012 and rules were formed to oversee its handling within the country. This needs to be checked,” he said. When The Hindu contacted the regional fire office, the senior officers first expressed doubts over the presence of such an explosive material in their jurisdiction and admitted to lack of clarity, experience and material in handling any eventualities. However, N. Sambasiva Rao, Managing Director of Sravan Shipping, said that everything was in place as per the rules and cleared by the Fire Department and others such as PESO. Post the Beirut incident, a three-member committee headed by the District Collector visited and inspected the facility on August 7. The panel in its report found no threat, but at the same time asked the State Disaster Management to conduct an in-depth study and suggest measures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/two-ships-with-ammonium-nitrate-barred-entry/article32470919.ece

At a webinar, organised by the Girijana Sangham on Friday, Mr. Sarma said that the draft environment policy, announced by the Centre, plans to do away with the mandatory Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) studies and obtaining public opinion before giving environmental clearances. The new policy, if implemented, would cause harm to the tribal people. He alleged that the industry heads, government officials and politicians colluded to amend the environmental laws in favour of corporate companies.

Hyderabad’s Naandi Foundation that has been working with the tribals of Araku on a livelihood project is planning to establish the Araku World Coffee School in the valley. Apart from making people understand the ‘integrated economic model that ensures profits for farmers and quality for consumers through regenerative agriculture’, the school will also guide in the understanding of cupping and grading coffee. Speaking to The Hindu , Manoj Kumar, CEO of Naandi Foundation, said: “We plan to set it up by February 2021. The place of this school is finalised and will be next to our processing unit in Araku.” Naandi will also open Araku Coffee's first café and roastery in the country in Bengaluru later this year. “A country which has over 60 years of history in coffee has sadly just five Q-graders today. This is the situation even when we have some of the best coffees being harvested in India. Today a majority of the Q-graders are from places like Japan and Korea. I want to bring about a change in this,” added Mr. Manoj. The Araku World Coffee School will have top international coffee experts as faculty. Araku Coffee has consistently won ratings as high as 90 out of 100 from professional cuppers associated with the well-regarded Specialty Coffee Association of America. For its ‘Arakunomics’, Naandi Foundation was recently selected by the Rockefeller Foundation as one of the ‘Top 10 Visionaries’ in the world for the Food Vision 2050 Prize which was announced in New York on August 6. The award recognised the application of ‘Arakunomics’ model in regions of Araku in Telangana, Wardha in Maharashtra and New Delhi, leading to the Food Vision 2050.

Rama Rao had earlier this month written to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan underscoring the need for Centre to unveil guidelines facilitating in timely development of safe and effective vaccines for COVID. At various forums, Mr. Rao had been highlighting how Hyderabad, already manufacturing one out of every three vaccines produced globally, is poised to play a major role in COVID vaccine with three firms in the city working, with partners, on vaccine candidates. On how many vaccine doses can India manufacture, Mr. Kumar said the process of collecting the information was underway as each manufacturer used a different kind of technology. A release said VP Minimally Invasive Therapies Group APAC and VP-MD India Subcontinent (South Asia) Medtronic Madan R. Krishnan, Sai Life Sciences Managing Director Krishna Kanumuri and Partner, Deal Advisory Head, Life Sciences Sector Sanjay Singh participated in the panel discussion. CII said that the second day of Make in Telangana conference deliberated on growth opportunities in food processing, pharma healthcare and life sciences, among others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-takes-stock-of-vaccine-manufacturing-units-in-city/article32470672.ece
29 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||RWAs should play a role in containing virus: Eatala||Health Minister Eatala Rajender asserted that the government has taken all measures to allay fears or apprehensions of people about coronavirus and instil confidence among them in combating the pandemic. “The government has studied the best practices from across the country and emulated them in effectively treating COVID patients,” he said. He said that though the world had faced several other viruses in the past, people faced them fearlessly as there was no publicity then. The incidence of COVID-19 had however led to fears among people, he said. The Minister was participating in a meeting with representatives of Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs) organised on Friday, as part of efforts to sensitise them about COVID. He said the government had focused attention on the urban poor to reach out healthcare services to their doorstep. As many as 200 Basti Dawakhanas have been opened in different areas so far in this direction and efforts were underway to open 100 more to cater to the needs of the vulnerable sections. Steps had been taken to ensure functioning of these clinics in the evenings too. Testing to diagnose COVID was being conducted in 145 clinics and urban primary healthcare centres in addition to organising mobile camps to detect patients and check the spread of the virus. Around 60,000 tests were being conducted on an average every day in different parts of the State. “Early detection of the virus will help in effectively treating patients and hence, tests have been intensified,” he said recalling that the case fatality rate in the State was at 0.7%, much lower than the national average. While apprehensions about the impact of the virus were a major cause of concern, social stigma attached to COVID was posing a major challenge to government. “We have seen cases where near and dear ones are leaving COVID patients to their fate. It is not proper on the part of people to ostracise such patients,” he said. Since the efforts by the government alone would not suffice in removing the social stigmas, it was decided to enlist the help of organisations like RWAs in this regard. “CM K. Chandrasekhar Rao is of the view that involving stakeholders like RWAs will go a long way in supplementing the government’s efforts,” he said, calling upon the representatives to join the government in combating the virus. The Minister wanted RWAs to sensitise people about COVID and assured that he was prepared to participate in such awareness programmes. He exhorted RWAs to utilise club houses, community halls, marriage halls and other spaces in their respective locations to treat patients. The government on its part was prepared to provide the necessary material like medicines and food to patients under treatment. The government would appoint a nodal officer to inform people about the availability of testing and free treatment, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rwas-should-play-a-role-in-containing-virus-eatala/article32470670.ece
29 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Human identity through genome’||Kumarasamy Thangaraj is synonymous with Indian population studies, origin and genetics analysis. CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB)’s chief scientist has just taken over as the director of Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) funded by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT). In this interview, the 57-year-old, hailing from Tamil Nadu, dwells on his plans and pioneering genetic studies. Excerpts: Congratulations! This institute is something close to your heart, isn’t it? Thank You! Yes, it is close to my field and I have been familiar with this institute from its inception as it originated from CCMB. Along with CDFD founder Dr. Lalji Singh, I made some contributions in its infant stage, including the logo! After it moved out of CCMB I was not keeping a regular touch but am very much familiar with the work here. I am confident of adding value to this field. How far have we come on genetic diagnostics and counselling over the years? About 70% of the cases coming here are being successfully diagnosed and solved through biochemical, chromosomal and DNA based diagnostics. May be, we can come closer to 100% success after we sequence the whole human genome. We should be in a position to resolve any diagnostic/human identification case, it is the level I visualise for CDFD. What happened to the genome project? We could not participate with the international team earlier, but now we have the capability, infrastructure and funds. DBT has recently provided funding for sequencing of 10,000 Indian genomes covering different castes and tribes. Twenty scientific organisations are involved in this project, including CCMB and CDFD. We are doing the groundwork for sample collection. It will catalogue genomic variations of different ethnic populations in three years. These would be reference sequences and will be made accessible for all the researchers in India. Has DNA diagnostics helped people take informed decisions through screening and counselling? It is now accessible as it has become affordable. Once we sequence a large number of genomes, we can identify the genetic cause for more number of diseases - common or rare. Based on our previous study, we predicted that at least 1/3 of Indian populations are susceptible for population-specific recessive disease, due to the practice of endogamy (marriage within caste and community). In this case, both parents would carry heterozygous mutation (one normal and another chromosome with mutation) and will have 25% of chance of transmitting the abnormal chromosome by both parents to the next generation, hence homozygous mutation and disease. Genetic analysis will help us identify the recessive mutation causing the disease. Mutations responsible for causing recessive disease can be screened at population level with very low expenditure and appropriate counselling can be provided. How do we deal once we identify the recessive mutation? Gene therapy has not picked up and there are ethical/regulatory issues with other modern technologies on ‘corrections’ of mutations. The best way is to ‘avoid’ through genetic testing, appropriate counselling and pre-natal diagnosis. Pre-marital counselling is another method and was taken up successfully by the Jews. They managed to eliminate two diseases over a period of time. We too can do the same keeping an eye on the foetus as there is 1/4th of the chance of the child having the disease or avoiding the marriage itself. If practised for a few generations, mutations can be eliminated from the population. Has the last word been said about the origin of Indians? Our earlier study had shown that the Andamanese are the first migrants out-of-Africa through the southern coast about 65,000 years ago and continue to be the purest. During this migration, some people settled in the southern part of India, whom we call Ancestral South Indians (ASI). Second wave of migration brought people to north, whom we call as Ancestral North Indians (ANI). These two groups (ASI & ANI) have ‘admixed’ between 2,000 and 4,000 years before present, irrespective of caste or community. We can easily correlate the range of skin colour we have in India, unlike say Europeans or Africans where a particular skin colour is prominent in the majority. Great Andamanese are mixed with other populations having lighter skin colour with curly hair. What is the CDFD role in COVID-19 control? Do you think scientific research will receive a fillip now? We have tested more than 1.54 lakh samples so far and also involved in genome sequencing of the virus. I must thank our scientists, PhD students and other staff for their efforts. Basic science does not give immediate results and requires time. But, the satisfaction of doing benefit to society through science cannot be matched. Although the number of students who come to biological research is reducing, I am sure the pandemic and issues like health and environment will make the young students to think and take biological research as their career path. Interest in science should be inculcated from the school level.  DBT has recently provided funding for sequencing of 10,000 Indian genomes covering different castes and tribes. Twenty scientific organisations are involved in this project, including CCMB and CDFD.

29 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Power from Singareni Power Plant to be dearer||The cost of power purchased by distribution licensees from the Singareni Thermal Power Project (STPP) will be costlier by Rs. 150 crore per annum. The Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission on Friday evening passed orders on multi-year power tariff for the project which has two units of 600 MW each at Jaipur in Mancherial district. As per the business plan, capital investment plan and multi-year tariff for 2019-20 to 2023-24 in respect of the project, the per unit cost worked out to Rs. 4.120 for 2019-20, Rs. 4.091 for 2020-21, Rs. 4.059 for 2021-22, Rs. 4.026 for 2022-23 and Rs. 3.990 for 2023-24. Overall, the per unit hike in cost on five year time scale was 25 paise. The commission had earlier passed orders granting Rs. 3.58 per unit for 2016-17, Rs. 3.43 per unit for 2017-18 and Rs. 3.49 for 2018-19. Aggrieved by the order, the STPP moved the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity for revision. After prolonged proceedings in the tribunal, the public hearing on true-up for past three years and the multi-year tariff took place by video conference on July 23 last. The commission also ordered that the arrears payable to STPP during the period of hearings for the whole of 2019-20 and the first four months of 2020-21 would be payable in six instalments. The order will come into force from April 1, 2019.  Variable costs By another order, the regulatory commission determined the variable cost suo moto for 2020-21 to 2023-24 for existing biomass, baggasse and industrial waste based power projects and having power purchase agreements with distribution licensees. The per unit cost of biomass power was Rs. 5.0069, bagasse Rs. 3.3002 and industrial waste Rs. 5.0069. The STPP claimed an interest on loan of Rs. 2,156 crore for maintenance of plant in 2019-20 but the ERC approved only Rs. 1,613 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/power-from-singareni-power-plant-to-be-dearer/article32470697.ece
29 August 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Congress demands putting off JEE, NEET||Demanding the postponement of Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE) and National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), the Telangana Congress and the National Students Union of India (NSUI) planned to protest at the Central government offices but the police prevented them from leaving the party headquarters — Gandhi Bhavan. After a mild scuffle with the police the Congress leaders and cadre staged a dharna at Gandhi Bhavan itself. The protest was part of All India Congress Committee (AICC) call at the all-India level. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy along with other senior leaders, including former PCC president Ponnala Lakshmaiah, former minister Marri Shashidhar Reddy, TPCC vice president Mallu Ravi, former MP M. Anjan Kumar Yadav, and other leaders like Vikram Goud, Bollu Kishan, Adam Santosh, Shaik Abdullah Sohail and Feroz Khan, participated in the protest. The TPCC chief accused the BJP government at the Centre and TRS government in Telangana State of playing with the lives of lakhs of students by planning to conduct examinations during coronavirus pandemic. He said COVID-19 cases were at their peak in almost all the States and India has recorded the world’s highest spike of 77,266 COVID-19 positive cases in a single day on Friday. Similarly, Telangana has been recording nearly 3,000 cases every day since the last one week. In a situation where the pandemic has spread to the community level Central government wants to put 25 lakh students and their families at risk and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was silent on the issue. “Central government should postpone the exams to a later date as there was nothing important than the lives of students.” Mr. Ponnala Lakshmaiah said that the Central government was blind to the reality and was not willing to realise even after several top leaders urged them postpone the exam. Former MP V. Hanumantha Rao staged a dharna at Aayakar Bhavan as part of the protest programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/congress-demands-putting-off-jee-neet/article32470699.ece
29 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TS welcomes farm infrastructure fund||Telangana government has welcomed the agriculture infrastructure fund proposed by Centre and expressed the hope that such a scheme would help in development of the sector, beside attracting investments. Though it was proposed that the Centre will bear 3% of interest levied on loans taken to invest in agriculture sector, it is better if there is no interest at all. If interest-free loans are given, the sector will invite more investments, Agriculture Minister S. Niranjan Reddy suggested to Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar at the latter's video conference with Chief Ministers and Agriculture Ministers of States to get their feedback on agriculture infrastructure fund. Deputises for KCR Mr. Niranjan Reddy deputised for Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao who was at a separate meeting with a delegation of the NABARD. The Agriculture Minister informed Mr. Tomar that the cropped area in the State had increased by 39% over last year due to increased irrigation facilities and pro-farmer policies of the State government. The cropped area as on date is 1.36 crore acres but is likely to go up by another four to five lakh acres in the coming days. Mr. Reddy appealed to the Centre to step up supply of fertilizer, particularly urea, to Telangana in view of higher agricultural operations. He sought clarity on reforms in maintenance of agriculture markets proposed by the Centre. Pat for Rythu Bandhu Earlier, Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture Sanjay Agarwal praised the Rytu Bandhu scheme and farmers coordination committees in the State. He hoped that the agriculture infrastructure fund would be implemented successfully with the network created by farmers committees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ts-welcomes-farm-infrastructure-fund/article32470701.ece

Rama Rao on Friday instructed officials concerned to ensure that every division, which has a huge population of urban poor in GHMC limits, has one or more ‘Basti Dawakhanas’. “At least 100 more ‘Basti Dawakhanas’ should be set up and made operational within the coming two months and some of these should be coming up near the two bedroom ‘dignity’ housing sites for the convenience of residents,” he said during a meeting held at the GHMC office. “The government’s plan is to increase the number of ‘Basti Dawakhanas’ to 300 to fulfil the medical needs of citizens in the twin cities. At present, 197 of these are providing medical services and getting good response from the poor for offering critical primary healthcare,” he said. About 53 kinds of free services are available in these urban health centres such as OP consultation, basic lab diagnosis, free medicines, antenatal and postnatal care services, and screening for non-communicable diseases such as BP and blood sugar. Each of these clinics is witnessing more than 100 footfalls per day and altogether 25,000 citizens are being treated at the OP services daily and 5,000 diagnostic tests are being conducted. Patients receive the test results on their mobile phone, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/more-basti-dawakhanas-on-the-anvil-says-ktr/article32470673.ece
29 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TS BJP seeks CEA probe into Srisailam fire mishap||Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has urged Union Power Minister R.K. Singh to order a probe through the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) on the recent fire mishap inside the Srisailam underground hydroelectric plant. Party president Bandi Sanjay met Mr. Singh on Friday and presented a memorandum seeking the probe alleging that the plant had lacked proper fire fighting systems and safety mechanisms in the event of an emergency and this led to the death of nine persons, including five engineers. No safety upgradation was done on the plant despite two flooding incidents in 1998 and 2009 at the dam and another fire accident in 2019 at the right bank station. There was no fire alarm, no smoke, no heat or flame detectors when the incident happened which could have alerted the employees, he said and claimed that the fire permissions have not been renewed on a regular basis. There was no fire suppression system and trapped employees were using the portable fire extinguishers which were not sufficient to put out the fire, charged the BJP leader. Mr. Sanjay told the Minister that the exit route did not have any emergency lighting and the area was plunged into darkness as soon as the fire broke out when at least two hours lighting is supposed to be on during such crises. The State government is solely responsible for the incident because it has been not paying dues to the Transco in thousands of crores and the Transco in turn has not been paying the Genco due to lack of funds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ts-bjp-seeks-cea-probe-into-srisailam-fire-mishap/article32470692.ece
29 August 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Man held for opening fire in air||An ex-service man was arrested by the Cyberabad police after he allegedly opened fire in the air with his pistol during a heated argument with a group of youths participating in Ganesh idol immersion at Hydershakote of Narsingi here on Thursday night. Narsingi inspector M Gangadhar said that the incident took place around 9 p.m. and came to their notice at 1 a.m. on Friday after locals reported the incident. The accused, Naga Malleshwar Rao, a retired Havildar in Indian Army, fired two rounds using his licensed pistol to threaten the youth, who gathered outside his house, after he started abusing them in filthy language, police said. Mr. Rao objected to the youths playing loud music and allegedly creating ‘nuisance’ on his apartment terrace and in the area. Viral video A video of the accused opening fire in air while arguing with the local youths went viral. “No one was injured as two fired bullets hit the roof,” Mr. Gangadhar said. Based on the complaint lodged by the youth, a case under Indian Penal Code and Arms Act was registered against the ex-service man, who was remanded in judicial custody. The accused is currently working at an automobile shop. The inspector said that they did not register case against the pandal organiser for violation of Epidemic Act by conducing a procession for immersion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/man-held-for-opening-fire-in-air/article32470679.ece
29 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC imposes Rs. 50,000 fine on PIL petitioner||Taking a serious note of filing PIL petition for wrong reasons and wasting court’s precious time, Telangana High Court on Friday imposed Rs. 50,000 fine on a petitioner. Rejecting the petitioner’s counsel request to reduce the fine amount, the HC ordered that the fine amount be deposited in Advocates Welfare Fund. Sixty-year-old B. Venkateshwarlu of Nalgonda district filed the PIL plea seeking a direction to authorities not to permit installation of a new petrol bunk in the vicinity of Nagarjunsagar dam. Hearing the petition, the bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy sought to know details of the petitioner. When his lawyer Venkat Mayur replied that he was working part-time, the bench specifically asked about his job profile. The lawyer replied the petitioner worked part-time in a petrol bunk. Observing that this had implied the possibility of the petrol bank management being behind the PIL petition, the bench said filing such sponsored pleas in the name of public interest was not fair. Tribals’ plea Hearing a separate writ petition which was moved as lunch motion, Justice A. Abhishek Reddy directed Jangaon District Collector not to plant trees in the house sites of 20 tribal families in Yerragolla Pahad village. Members of these families moved the HC stating that over a 100 policemen arrived at their homes on Thursday and tried to forcibly evict them from their house sites. These lands were allotted to them by the government in 1998, their counsel N.S. Arjun Kumar told the court. The lawyer presented photographs of police trying to evict the families before the court. The judge sought to know from the government pleader why so many policemen were present there. The government counsel sought time to secure instructions on the matter. The petition was posted to Monday for hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-imposes-rs-50000-fine-on-pil-petitioner/article32470690.ece

The accused, a resident Uttar Pradesh, chatted with Mr. Joginipally’s friends through the fake account saying that he needs money for his friend’s daughter’s medical treatment at Bhopal, and requested them to send the amount. On Tuesday a person approached police stating that he got a Facebook friend request and he accepted it. A few minutes later, he got a message from the said account to send Rs. 50,000 via GooglePay. “After which the complainant made an inquiry about the profile and found that it was a fake account, and he requested us to take action,” police said. Based on the complaint, a case was registered and during the course of the investigation, the fraudster, a juvenile, was apprehended. “The boy collects information of VIPs throughout India via social media and used to practice their language in the same terminology to a make a quick buck. Likewise, he observed the profile details of Mr. Joginipally through Facebook and hatched a plan to make money from his followers,” the investigators said.

Chandrasekhar Rao should take the blame for his ‘failure’ to wake up to the reality of COVID. Mr. Bhatti, who is on a tour of government hospitals in the State for the last three days, visited Adilabad and Nirmal hospitals on Friday. He interacted with the doctors and para medical staff and complimented them for meeting the challenges despite sparse resources made available to them. He alleged that government hospitals were in a poor shape and it was unfortunate that hospitals in the districts represented by Health Minister Eatela Rajender, Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao and Endowments Minister Indrakaran Reddy too, lacked basic facilities. “You can’t expect better facilities in other hospitals.” He said that 129 posts were vacant in Adilabad hospital and the TRS government has failed to fill them up. The previous Congress government constructed the hospital spending Rs. 150 crore but the TRS government has not spent a single rupee for improving the infrastructure, he claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bhatti-covid-deaths-are-govt-murders/article32470676.ece

He was speaking at a meeting held here on Friday to mark the 20th anniversary of the Basheerbagh incident, in which three protesters of the anti-power tariff hike agitation were killed in police firing in Hyderabad during the then TDP's regime in the erstwhile undivided Andhra Pradesh. He criticised the BJP dispensation at the Centre for allegedly trying to dilute the powers of the State electricity regulatory commissions and phase out subsidies in the power sector to benefit private companies in the name of reforms. “The move will result in a steep hike in power tariff," he charged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/left-parties-mourn-victims-of-basheerbagh-police-firing/article32470700.ece

29 August 2020||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Rs. 10,000 loan to 12,000 street vendors in Sangareddy||Finance Minister T. Harish Rao directed the officials to extend Rs. 10,000 loan to 12,000 street vendors in all municipalities of the district. Participating in handing over of cheques to beneficiaries under Atma Nirbhar, Kalyana Lakshmi and Shaadi Mubarak schemes here at the Collectorate on Friday, Mr. Rao said so far loans were given to 2,000 street vendors and the remaining need to be covered by September-end. He directed Additional Collector Rajarshi Sha to take up special drive by roping in commissioners of all municipalities in the district. Referring to welfare schemes like Kalyana Lakshmi and Shaadi Mubarak being extended by the State government, Mr. Rao said that Telangana is the only State in the country implementing the scheme. He said that about Rs. 1,000 crore was spent on Aasara pensions and Rs. 7,400 crore was spent on Rythu Bandhu scheme despite dip in revenues due to the impact of Corona virus. The Minister said that Sangareddy district stood in first place in the State in constructing toilets for every 1,000 people as instructed by the government. Informing that 2,000 corona tests were conducted so far in Sangareddy district till Thursday, he said that each primary health center (PHC) is conducting 50 tests every day. Expressing displeasure with people not coming forward to get tested for corona, he said that it will adversely impact the health of family members and neighbours. Lok Sabha member K. Prabhakar Reddy said that never in the past did any government extended benefits like that of Kalyan Lakshmi and Shaadi Mubarak. Zilla Parishad Chairperson P. Manjushree, Collector M.

29 August 2020||JAIPUR,||JSA demands withdrawal of health centres from PPP mode in Rajasthan||The Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, functioning as the Rajasthan chapter of the People’s Health Movement, on Friday demanded that the State government withdraw the Primary Health Centres with an “unsatisfactory performance” from the public-private partnership. As many as 36 of these PHCs in both rural and urban areas in the State have been found to be unsatisfactory. The State government had earlier this year assured a Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court that the PPP mode experiment would be discontinued with immediate effect wherever there was a report about unsatisfactory performance of the PHC. As per the government’s submission, 31 rural PHCs and 5 urban PHCs were found to be unsatisfactory after an assessment. JSA member Chhaya Pachauli, director of Chittorgarh-based Prayas Centre for Health Equity, said the movement’s review had revealed that all the PHCs found unsatisfactory in the State government’s assessment continued to be run by private agencies in the PPP mode. The government has reportedly not abided by its own assurance given to the court. ‘Violation of order’ “This is not just a violation of the court’s order but also an irresponsible act on the part of the State government, which has left people’s health at the mercy of private bodies found to be ill-equipped and inefficient in operating the PHCs,” Ms. Pachauli said. She demanded that the PHCs be brought under direct operation by the government and withdrawn from private partners. The JSA has shot off a letter to Chief Secretary Rajeeva Swarup, pointing out that the failure to withdraw the 36 PHCs from the PPP mode would amount to contempt of the High Court in view of its direction passed on January 10 this year after the State government’s assurance. The court had on August 1, 2019, passed an extensive direction for appointment of district-level teams and assessment of PHCs around the necessary parameters for their functioning on a batch of public interest writ petitions alleging “glaring inadequacies” in the PPP scheme implemented in the public health sector. In its January 10-judgment, the court acknowledged the government’s assurance and directed that the State would continue to monitor performance of PHCs every three months. “Before giving any new PHC on the PPP mode, the private partner’s ability to provide necessary infrastructure shall be verified and it will be made to a sign a bond for paying compensation in the event of underperformance,” the Bench directed. The State government had handed over 75 PHCs in rural and 37 in urban areas to private entities. The PHCs found unsatisfactory are in the districts such as Jaipur, Alwar, Jaisalmer, Bharatpur, Udaipur, Sawai Madhopur, Jalore, Pali, Dausa and Rajsamand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/jsa-demands-withdrawal-of-health-centres-from-ppp-mode-in-rajasthan/article32470802.ece
29 August 2020||Mumbai,||VCs to chalk out plan for final year exams||The Maharashtra government on Friday convened an urgent meeting of vice-chancellors (VCs) of universities in the State to chalk out plans for conducting the final year examinations after the Supreme Court ruled that students cannot be promoted without exams. State Higher and Technical Education Minister Uday Samant said, “We respect the Supreme Court’s decision. We will be discussing with all vice-chancellors how to conduct the exams. We had informed the court that the COVID-19 situation will create problems. The court has still asked us to go ahead with the exams. We will act accordingly.” Mr. Samant said the State government was not in favour of conducting the exams considering the safety of around nine lakh students. He said a committee comprising VCs and experts has been formed to prepare a timetable for the exams. The committee has been asked to submit its report in two days. “We will not announce the dates randomly. We will give necessary time for the students to prepare for the exams,” he said. The Yuva Sena, the ruling Shiv Sena’s youth wing, had approached the Supreme Court, challenging the University Grants Commission’s (UGC) order to conduct the exams. The apex court turned down the plea and directed the UGC to fix dates for the exams as per the recommendation of the State government. “Safety of students is our utmost priority. There are colleges which are being used as quarantine centres. We will schedule the timetable based on the COVID-19 situation in particular areas,” Mr. Samant said. ‘Govt. stance rigid’ The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attacked the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, claiming that it was playing with the future of students on the whims of one young leader in the State Cabinet. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said, “When the Supreme Court has ruled that the final year examinations must be held, why is the Uddhav Thackeray government and the Yuva Sena [led by State Minister Aaditya Thackeray] bent upon their rigid, one-sided stance? We welcome the apex court’s decision and its rejection of petitions calling for final year exams to be cancelled.” In a thinly veiled criticism of Mr. Aaditya Thackeray, Mr. Fadnavis said VCs across the country and the State had consistently held the view that students could not be promoted without conducting the exams and degrees thus conferred would be devoid of any value. “The government did not consult with anyone before deciding on cancelling exams. Even though students’ health is important, their educational health is equally important. All this was done for the sake of one organisation,” said BJP MLA Ashish Shelar, without naming Mr. Aaditya Thackeray. Refuting allegations Mr. Samant rubbished the allegations saying such comments are the bread and butter of the Opposition. “Our stand was to safeguard the health of students. Now, we will work as ordered by the court,” he said, adding that the option of filing a review petition has not yet been discussed with the CM. Reacting to the verdict, Mr. Aaditya Thackeray tweeted, “As Yuva Sena, we welcome the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. The Hon’ble SC has upheld our most important point: to uphold the decision of Maharashtra State Disaster Management Authority. The Hon’ble SC has reiterated that it is upto the respective State Governments to decide on when and how to hold examinations, not at the insistence of the 30th September deadline of the UGC. The Yuva Sena stands firmly for the well being and good health of the students, teachers, non teaching staff and their families (sic).” (With inputs from Shoumojit Banerjee)  We had informed the court that the COVID-19 situation will create problems. The court has still asked us to go ahead with the exams.

29 August 2020||MUMBAI,||‘Rashtriya Khel Protsahan Puraskar recognition of our hard work’||Nilesh Kulkarni has a penchant for firsts. The former cricketer, who became the first Indian bowler to pick a wicket off his first ball in Test cricket in 1997, continued the trend off the field even after hanging up his boots. In 2010, Mr. Kulkarni and his wife Rasika co-founded the International Institute of Sports Management (IISM), with an eye on providing professionals to an industry that was then taking baby steps in the country. Since then, besides having groomed more than 1,500 sports industry professionals, IISM has also been recognised as the University of Mumbai’s sports management degree course. On Saturday, the educational institute will receive its biggest achievement and recognition during its decade-long sojourn when it will be presented the Rashtriya Khel Protsahan Puraskar by President Ramnath Kovid during a virtual National Sports Awards ceremony. ‘A special moment’ “It is a reward and recognition of the hard work put in by the students, associates, faculty members and last but not the least, team IISM, over the last 10 years,” an elated Mr. Kulkarni told The Hindu on Friday. “It is an extremely special moment for all of us at IISM,” he said. When the couple — with Mr. Kulkarni having achieved sporting excellence and Rasika possessing a strong event management background — started planning IISM after his retirement from First Class cricket in 2007, there were many sceptics whether a sports management institute would make sense. But their vision was clear. “Sports as an industry was almost non-existent back then. Only after the advent of IPL people realised the need for sports professionals in India,” Mr. Kulkarni said. “Since then, almost 14 to 15 national franchise leagues have emerged and all these leagues have required trained, professional workforce and managers to cater to the demands of the industry. Be it management, sales, operations, when it comes to sports, you need a different outlook and we are glad to have contributed to it,” he said. Over the last decade, IISM has moved from a small facility on the Jai Hind College premises to a sprawling facility in Marol. It has resulted in it evolving into an institute with a thrust on practical knowledge and primary data generation hub. “We let our students have at least 150 hours of experience on the field in an academic year. Besides, in the last three to four years, our students have generated more than 25 papers in order to create primary data. These kids are going to be torch-bearers for the sports industry and our endeavour is to help them get a hands-on experience.” Besides tying up with major sports industry firms, IISM has been associated with Khelo India Games and the Sports Authority of India over the last couple of years. Mr. Kulkarni stresses that his learnings as a cricketer have helped him a great deal during his second stint. “Cricket taught me on the field all the management lessons, including leadership, decision-making and critical thinking. Most importantly, the ability of handling failure and rising from it,” Mr. Kulkarni said. ‘Long way to go’ “Rasika and I have converted it into our organisation motto. We have failed but we have learnt to convert it into a baby step for success. It’s just a beginning, still a long way to go,” he said.  Our students are going to be torch-bearers for the sports industry and our endeavour is to help them get a hands-on experience Nilesh Kulkarni Former cricketer||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/rashtriya-khel-protsahan-puraskar-recognition-of-our-hard-work/article32470790.ece
29 August 2020||Mumbai,||High Court allows conditional Muharram procession in Mumbai||The Bombay High Court on Friday granted permission to hold Taziya processions on Muharram in Mumbai provided not more than five people take part in it and stringent COVID-19 precautions are followed. The court said no other such processions would be allowed in the State. A Division Bench of Justices S.J. Kathawalla and Madhav Jamdar was hearing a petition filed by All India Idaara-E-Tahafuz-E-Hussainiyat, seeking permission to carry out the symbolic procession amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The organisation had sought a direction from the High Court to allow rituals to be performed for two hours every day from August 27 to 30. According to the court’s order, members of the community will be permitted to carry out the procession on August 30, between 4.30 p.m. and 5.30 p.m. on a pre-determined route only by trucks and not on foot. A maximum of five people, along with one videographer, will be allowed on the truck and only five will be permitted to walk with the Taziya for the last 100 metres on the selected route, the court said. The five participants will be required to submit their personal details and addresses to the office of the Commissioner of Police, Mumbai, by 5 p.m., on August 29. The court said the organisation will have to strictly abide by the guidelines issued by the Home Department with respect to the observance of Muharram. The court also directed the State government to impose all necessary restrictions, including Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code if required, to control crowds. The court has directed the president and the general secretary of the organisation to meet the principal secretary of the Home Department, and the secretary of the Disaster Management Department. The court said, “The State government shall, if not already imposed, impose a restriction over gathering of people at the appropriate places, by issuing appropriate orders, including the point where the Taziya is to start its journey, by passing appropriate orders under Section 144 (power to issue order in urgent cases of nuisance of apprehended danger) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/high-court-allows-conditional-muharram-procession-in-mumbai/article32470796.ece
29 August 2020||Mumbai,||Judge records dissenting view on linking Tablighis with anti-CAA protests||Justice M.G. Sewlikar of the Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court has recorded a dissenting view on observations made by Justice T.V. Nalawade on linking Tablighis with the protests against the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the country. A Division Bench of Justice Nalawade and Justice Sewlikar had quashed the FIRs against 29 foreign nationals who were booked under sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Maharashtra Police Act, the Disaster Management Act and the Foreigner’s Act for allegedly violating tourist visa conditions by attending a religious convention in Delhi. Justice Sewlikar said, “I agree with all the observations of my learned brother except the observations contained.” On August 21, in his 58-page judgment, Justice Nalawade said, “There were protests taking place in several parts of India prior to January 2020. Most of the persons who participated in the protest were Muslims. It is their contention that the CAA is discriminatory. They believe that Indian citizenship will not be granted to Muslim refugees and migrants. They were protesting against the NRC.” Justice Sewlikar said, “I do not agree with some reasoning and I find it difficult to concur with these observations as allegations in this respect are not made in the petitions nor there is any evidence in this regard. Therefore, in my opinion, these observations are outside the scope of the petitions.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/judge-records-dissenting-view-on-linking-tablighis-with-anti-caa-protests/article32470797.ece
29 August 2020||Navi Mumbai,||Set up permanent camp in Raigad, district collector appeals to NDRF||Raigad District Collector Nidhi Choudhary has written to the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), requesting it to set up a permanent camp in the district. Ms. Choudhary said in case of any disaster, like the recent building collapse in Mahad tehsil, NDRF teams have to be sent from Mumbai or Pune. She said it takes more than three hours for the teams to reach the district and begin rescue work. After the five-storeyed building collapsed at 6.45 p.m. on Monday, the NDRF teams from Pune were able to reach the site, through a green corridor, only by 1.10 a.m. on Tuesday. “Raigad is prone to floods and landslides. The district receives heavy rainfall and the rivers swell, leading to flooding. There are also many industries here, which makes it prone to accidents. We are hoping for a positive response from the NDRF. If approved, we would request them to set up a camp at Mahad as many industries are situated here. The area is also most vulnerable to floods,” Ms. Choudhary said. One NDRF team has been asked to stay back in Mahad till the end of the monsoon. “The survivors are staying with relatives. We have made arrangements for food and shelter. We have started listing their missing belongings to help them claim insurance,” Mahad tehsildar Suresh Kashid said. Ms. Choudhary has appealed to people to donate to the District Disaster Response Fund.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/set-up-permanent-camp-in-raigad-district-collector-appeals-to-ndrf/article32470793.ece

29 August 2020||Pune,||‘We are united in this struggle against this terrible pandemic’||Ten months since their ‘morning coup’ had startled Maharashtra, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar shared the dais with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis at the inauguration of COVID-19 facilities in Pune and Pimpri areas on Friday. Mr. Pawar said, “Since yesterday, news channels have been flashing ‘breaking news’ of Mr. Fadnavis and myself coming together on the same platform… I just want to say that whatever may be our political ideologies, we are united in this struggle against this terrible COVID-19 pandemic.” The Deputy Chief Minister said during times of crises, it has been Maharashtra’s political tradition that ruling and Opposition parties come together and resolve difficult situations. Mr. Pawar and Mr. Fadnavis inaugurated a 200-bed autocluster at Pimpri and a 314-bed, multi-storey mini-jumbo facility, with 270 oxygenated beds and 44 ICU beds, at Pune’s Baner-Balewadi. Mr. Pawar said several corporators and legislators from both the ruling and the Opposition parties have tested positive for COVID-19 and a number of them have succumbed to the virus. ‘Help us rectify mistakes’ He said, “If there has been any shortcomings on the part of our government, then the Opposition can help us rectify them in a constructive manner… Instead of indulging in blame-games at this critical juncture, we have to work together to triumph over the pandemic.” The Deputy Chief Minister said shortage of critical care beds should not arise in Pune or Pimpri-Chinchwad. He also said authorities have constituted 20 flying squads in rural areas to check if hospitals are overcharging. He also said citizens moving around without masks would be fined Rs. 1,000. Mr. Pawar said, “Wearing masks is mandatory. Those flouting regulations, or spitting, will be penalised. At a time when officials, municipal workers and other frontline workers are trying to fight the virus, the public must behave responsibly by taking basic precautions.” Mr. Fadnavis also lauded the efforts of Mr. Pawar and the civic authorities to ramp up sample testing capacities across Pune district. On November 23 last year, soon after the Maharashtra Assembly polls, Mr. Pawar was sworn in as Deputy Chief Minister and Mr. Fadnavis took oath as Chief Minister. Mr. Pawar resigned in less than 80 hours and was sworn-in again as Deputy CM in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government a few days later.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/we-are-united-in-this-struggle-against-this-terrible-pandemic/article32470795.ece

29 August 2020||Tokyo,||Japan’s PM quits citing health reasons||Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on Friday he will resign, ending his record-breaking tenure in a bombshell development that kicks off a leadership race in the world’s third-largest economy. Mr. Abe said he is suffering a recurrence of the ulcerative colitis that forced him to cut short a first term in office, and that he no longer felt able to continue as Prime Minister. “Now that I am not able to fulfil the mandate from the people with confidence, I have decided that I should no longer occupy the position of the Prime Minister,” he said. While speculation about Mr. Abe’s political future has grown in recent weeks, after two hospital visits for unspecified health checks, the resignation nonetheless came as a surprise. Even as recently as Friday morning, the government spokesman had appeared to dismiss concerns about Mr. Abe’s health and suggested he would stay on. But Abe made clear that would not be possible, apologising for once again cutting short his tenure. “I would like to sincerely apologise to the people of Japan for leaving my post with one year left in my term of office, and amid the coronavirus woes,” he said, bowing deeply. ‘A big surprise’ Mr. Abe said he would “firmly execute my duty to the end”, and until the next Prime Minister is appointed, possibly through a leadership election involving ruling party lawmakers and members. The resignation shocked the markets, with Tokyo stocks plunging more than 2% towards the end of afternoon trade when reports of Abe’s decision first emerged. “It was a big surprise”, said Shinichi Nishikawa, a professor of political science at Meiji University in Tokyo. Mr. Abe had been expected to stay in office until the end of his term as LDP leader in September 2021, and the jockeying for position to succeed him was still in its early stages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/japans-pm-quits-citing-health-reasons/article32470323.ece
29 August 2020||Hong Kong,||China arrests 12 fleeing HK by boat||A dozen people fleeing Hong Kong on a speedboat, including an activist arrested under the draconian new national security law, have been captured by China, police in the city said on Friday. The boat was intercepted by the coastguard, police said, with local media saying it was en route to Taiwan, a self-ruled island that regularly offers sanctuary to people escaping the authoritarian mainland. Multiple media reports said the 12 included Andy Li, who was arrested earlier this month for alleged collusion with foreign forces — a crime under the new Beijing-imposed law that carries a possible life sentence. The pro-Beijing Wen Wei Po newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said others onboard included several arrested for their part in the sometimes violent pro-democracy protests that wreaked Hong Kong for much of 2019. Hong Kong police said the 12, aged between 16 and 33, were being held by mainland authorities. They gave no details on when they would be handed back to Hong Kong. Security law Beijing imposed its swingeing national security law in June after tiring of the protests. The law is described by China as a “sword” hanging over the heads of its pro-democracy opponents. Authorities promised it would not apply to past transgressions. But details from more than 20 arrests so far show actions, including political speeches and online posts made before the law was introduced, have formed a key part of investigations, helping police obtain search warrants, conduct raids and make arrests. Overnight, certain opinions and expressions in previously free-wheeling Hong Kong became illegal, and activists have spoken of a deep chilling effect that has seen books yanked from libraries and publishers rush to amend their titles. “They will go back into your history and look for connections,” one lawyer involved in national security investigations Seeking asylum Hong Kong’s administration insists the law has not impinged on the rights to freedom of speech and assembly. But a number of pro-democracy figures have left the city since it came into effect, fearful that they may be swept up in a Beijing dragnet and disappear into the mainland’s opaque and Communist Party-run justice system. Before the new law was imposed in response to the huge protests that erupted in June 2019, Hong Kong police had arrested more than 9,000 people, among whom more than 600 were charged with rioting, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail. At least 50 former Hong Kong protesters had already applied for asylum in various jurisdictions before the coronavirus pandemic ended most international travel. Hundreds more have relocated to democratic Taiwan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-arrests-12-fleeing-hk-by-boat/article32470318.ece
29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||A Prime Minister who raised Japan’s profile||Japan is back, announced Shinzo Abe in a speech during a visit to the U.S. in February 2013, shortly after he became Prime Minister for the second time. His first stint at the helm in 2006 only lasted a year, cut short both by health problems and political controversies that diminished his popularity. This time, he promised, he wasn’t going anywhere. He didn’t. Over the next seven years, Mr. Abe, who announced his retirement on Friday because of health reasons, would not only become his country’s longest-serving Prime Minister, but one who would leave a lasting legacy on Japan’s foreign policy, defence strategy, and role in Asia. “Japan is not, and will never be, a tier-two country,” he had said in the 2013 speech, outlining three priorities for his foreign policy. The first, he said, was for Japan to be a leading promoter of rules for trade and in other areas in the “Indo-Pacific region” — a term Mr. Abe was among the first to popularise, as long back as in 2007, when in an address to the Indian Parliament, he reflected how “the Pacific and the Indian Oceans are now bringing about a dynamic coupling as seas of freedom and of prosperity”. He also pitched for Japan to become “a guardian of the global commons”, particularly in an increasingly contested maritime domain, and to work closely with “like-minded democracies”, such as the U.S., India, Australia and South Korea. He broadly succeeded on all three fronts, says Hiroyuki Akita, a commentator at Nikkei in Tokyo. “He made great achievements in foreign and security affairs,” he told The Hindu . “In particular, he strengthened the U.S.-Japan alliance significantly, and based on that, he established a base for regional security cooperation by the U.S., Japan, India, and Australia [or Quad]. This framework has been, and will be, an important asset for the peace and stability in Indo-Pacific.” Ties with India Deepening relations with India, both on the investment front and through stepped up security cooperation under the Quad, had been a priority for Mr. Abe’s foreign policy, although some initiatives, such as the bullet train corridor, did not take off. Mr. Akita said his other lasting legacy would be his shepherding of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, seen as an economic counter to China. “While the Trump administration leaned toward trade protectionism, the Abe administration managed to establish the TPP even without U.S., thereby enabling the Asia Pacific region to somehow maintain a momentum of free trade.” Mr. Abe also championed a greater global role for Japan, and sought to remove some of the shackles imposed on Japan’s military by its post Second World War pacifist Constitution. While he failed to change Article 9 of the Constitution, under his watch Japan amended laws to allow its armed forces to be deployed overseas and the military for the first time took part in exercises on foreign soil. Richard McGregor, Senior Fellow at the Lowy Institute and author of “Asia’s Reckoning: China, Japan, and the Fate of U.S. Power in the Pacific Century”, said “there is no doubt that Abe has been a hugely consequential Prime Minister, even without achieving two of his main goals, a revision of the country’s post-war Constitution and a peace treaty with Russia.” “He has substantially rebuilt relations with Beijing, even as Japan has competed head-on with China on influence and investment in the region, and without conceding on territorial issues. He has also made Japan perhaps the most respected diplomatic player in the Indo-Pacific, which is saying something, given Japan’s size relative to the U.S. and China,” he said. On China, Mr. Abe was less hawkish than many expected him to be, both home and abroad, as he balanced a fine line between courting China economically while mounting a robust counter to China’s deepening influence in the region. He took over just as relations hit a nadir in 2012, when China had essentially cut off all ties angered by a move to “nationalise” the disputed Senkaku or Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea. “Diplomatically and economically, he has improved relations with China,” said Yoshikazu Kato, an expert on Japan-China relations at the Asia Global Institute in Hong Kong, noting that he went ahead with a visit in 2014 to Beijing for the APEC summit and sought a meeting with President Xi Jinping despite some opposition at home. Concessions to China While not budging on Japan’s sovereignty, he at the same time made some concessions such as agreeing a four-point consensus on the East China Sea in which, Mr. Kato said, Japan “finally acknowledged territorial disputes existed, which it previously did not.” While Mr. Abe might have changed Japanese foreign policy, it is “an open question to whether he has changed the country itself”, said Mr. McGregor. “There is still little public support for constitutional revision to free up the military,” he said, “despite rising threats from China and North Korea.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/a-prime-minister-who-raised-japans-profile/article32470317.ece
29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Biden will destroy American greatness, says Trump||Accepting the Republican Party’s nomination for the presidency, U.S. President Donald Trump delivered a 70-minute speech rife with exaggerations and false statements on the final night of the Republican National Convention (RNC). The President attacked Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s record and his plans for the presidency on a number of fronts — from jobs and the economy to public health and policing. His remarks come as the American southeast faces a powerful hurricane and as the country’s death toll from the pandemic crossed 180,000. “This election will decide whether we save the American Dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny,” Mr. Trump said from the South Lawn of the White House. Mr. Trump’s speech emphasised common themes that ran through all four days of the convention: narratives of the Democrats as “radicals” who did not respect the idea of America and warnings of unsafe if not non-existent borders, lawless cities and anarchy under a Biden administration. ‘People’s President’ The President was introduced by his daughter Ivanka Trump on Thursday evening. “Four years ago, I introduced to you a builder, an entrepreneur, an outsider, and the people’s nominee for President of the United States. Tonight, I stand before you as the proud daughter of the people’s president,” Ms. Trump said. Speaking on a specially constructed stage with a campaign-style backdrop, complete with Trump-Pence signage, Mr. Trump made direct and oblique references to Mr. Biden’s acceptance speech from a week ago, in which the Democratic candidate had described a battle for America’s soul. “Joe Biden is not the saviour of America’s soul — he is the destroyer of America’s jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump is the first U.S. President in modern times to accept his nomination on the grounds of the White House. Critics have argued that he and several other participants at the RNC are in possible violation of the Hatch Act, which prohibits government officials from using federal property for political purposes. Speaking to an audience of about 1,500 people mostly without masks and not observing social distance, Mr. Trump spoke of defeating the novel coronavirus pandemic which has affected the U.S. more than it has any other country.  Mr. Trump and other speakers at the RNC are specifically targeting suburban women with a college degree, a demographic they hope will help Mr. Trump who lags Mr. Biden in polls. Among Mr. Trump’s false claims were that the Democrats would “demolish” suburbs and end the Second Amendment (the right to bear arms). “If the Left gains power, they will demolish the suburbs, confiscate your guns and appoint justices who will wipe away your second amendment and other constitutional freedoms. Biden is a Trojan horse for socialism. If Joe Biden doesn’t have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders... then how is he ever going to stand up for you?” Mr. Trump said. (Mr. Biden’s platform explicitly supports the Second Amendment while also calling for gun control. Mr Biden wants to reinstate an Obama administration law to address the challenge of discrimination in housing across localities. He does not oppose single-family homes in suburbs.) Tough line Mr. Trump also said Mr. Biden wanted to dismantle America’s borders (a false claim) and that the borders were stronger than ever before under the Trump administration. He repeatedly talked about the tough line his administration had taken on China and contrasted it to Mr. Biden’s approach. “That’s why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win,” Mr. Trump said. “I can tell you that upon very good information, China would own our country.” Other speakers — some of whom recorded video messages from another location in Washington DC — included Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, Marsha and Karl Mueller whose daughter was killed by the Islamic State, Ann Dorn, whose husband was killed by rioters in June, and Senator Tom Cotton, a possible 2024 candidate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-will-destroy-american-greatness-says-trump/article32470320.ece
29 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Pained to hear about dear friend Abe’s ill health: Modi||Within hours of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s announcement that he would step down for health reasons, Prime Minister Narendra Modi wished him a speedy recovery. “Pained to hear about your ill health, my dear friend [Shinzo Abe],” PM Modi wrote in a tweet. “In recent years, with your wise leadership and personal commitment, the India-Japan partnership has become deeper and stronger than ever before,” he added. Mr. Modi also tweeted a photograph of both leaders from his visit to Mount Fuji in 2018, which was the last time the India-Japan annual summit was held. In December 2019, PM Abe had to cancel his visit to Guwahati, where he was due to meet PM Modi for the summit, due to violence over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and subsequently, his trip could not be scheduled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. During his first tenure as Prime Minister in 2006-2007 and then since 2012, Mr. Abe had made a particular push for better ties with India. The Quadrilateral, a forum between India, U.S., Japan, and Australia, was originally Mr. Abe’s idea, who called for an “arc of prosperity and freedom” across the Indo-Pacific. However, despite several attempts, and a strong friendship between the two leaders, he was unable to convince PM Modi to join the 15-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which India walked out of last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pained-to-hear-about-dear-friend-abes-ill-health-modi/article32470326.ece
29 August 2020||Berlin,||Navalny's condition is improving, says hospital||The Berlin hospital treating leading Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said on Friday there was “some improvement” in his condition after he suffered a suspected poisoning. The 44-year-old nevertheless remains in a medically induced coma and on a ventilator, Berlin's renowned Charite hospital said in a statement, describing his condition as serious but not life-threatening. “There has been some improvement in the symptoms” caused by the poisoning, the statement said. “However, due to the severity of the patient's poisoning, it remains too early to gauge potential long-term effects.” Navalny, a leading opposition figure, fell ill after boarding a plane in Siberia last week. He was initially treated in a local hospital before being flown to Berlin for treatment last Saturday. Charite doctors said they believed the anti-corruption campaigner was poisoned with a substance that inhibits the cholinesterase enzyme, a feature of nerve agents. Navalny's allies say he may have been poisoned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/navalnys-condition-is-improving-says-hospital/article32470316.ece
29 August 2020||Islamabad,||Pak. orders YouTube to block vulgar content||Pakistani regulators have asked YouTube to immediately block all videos they consider “objectionable” from being accessed in the country, a demand criticised by rights campaigners. There are already fears about creeping censorship and muzzling of the press and activists in Muslim-majority Pakistan, with existing or proposed restrictions limiting free speech, usually in the name of Islam or national security. In a statement, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said it has asked YouTube to “immediately block vulgar, indecent, immoral, nude and hate speech content for viewing in Pakistan”. The PTA said viewing such content has “extremely negative effects” and can foster “repugnant discord”. In July, the PTA issued a final warning to Chinese-owned social media app TikTok, ordering it to filter any obscene content. YouTube was blocked in the Muslim-majority country in 2012 after a U.S.-made film negatively depicted the Prophet Mohammed, which triggering backlash.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pak-orders-youtube-to-block-vulgar-content/article32470324.ece

29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||In Idukki, living in fear of landslides||It had been raining incessantly in the lush green Rajamala hills of Munnar in Kerala’s Idukki district since August 1. The downpour was especially heavy on August 6. But the tea plantation workers of the layams (labour lines)of the Kanan Devan Hills in Pettimudi, a small idyllic valley, did not find any reason to be worried. Pettimudi conjoins the rolling slopes some 11 km from where the Eravikulam National Park ends for tourists. “When rainwater flooded the labour lines, it seemed like a repeat of last August,” recalls Anil Kumar, a resident and daily wage earner at the national park famous for the Nilgiri tahrs. “Around 10:45 p.m., the water began to get muddy and we thought a stream nearby had breached the banks. Suddenly, my brother looked out and hollered. Through the noise of the rain came a loud thud. Boulders came crashing down. He said something dangerous was happening. We all rushed out. Where four housing lines stood at some distance below ours, there was only debris,” he says. A massive landslide that originated from a spot in the shola forests 2 km uphill from the labour quarters had sent down a torrent of sludge, rocks and fallen trees that pulverised to dirt four of the six tin-roofed structures in the neighbourhood. The wreckage was strewn over a large area and spilled into the river on the lower side of the Raj-era settlements. Sixty-five people, most of them estate workers, were killed, while five were missing as on August 27. Rescuers could only save 12 people. The search operation has been temporarily called off in view of the rising water levels in the river and is expected to resume when the situation improves. A long, dark night A few had a close call. With water gushing into his dwelling unit in one of the two lines in the upper reaches that housed 16 families, Suresh Kumar, a daily wage earner, was thinking of taking shelter in his cousin’s house in one of the ill-fated lines below. “It was pitch dark thanks to the persisting rain and we had suffered a power outage for several days. By 11 p.m. or so, we decided to move to my cousin’s place. That’s when we bumped into a frightened Doraisamy, a friend, who told us about the calamity, though we did not know of its scale then. He took us to his house,” says Suresh Kumar. Thankfully, his housing line and the one next to it survived. Doraisamy, who quit working in the plantations but whose parents were still employed in the fields, was probably the first to sense the gravity of the situation. He trudged back to the site of devastation along with Suresh Kumar. They heard a voice, barely audible, from within the massive heap of rubble. “It was Mayilsamy calling for help, but we couldn’t locate him. So we returned to collect more people before going back again. As the rain subsided a bit, we were able to pull out four people who were trapped underneath mounds of debris. But Mayilsamy wasn’t among them. His frail cry still rings in my ears. We couldn’t save him,” laments Suresh Kumar. As the night thickened, the showers resumed. Fear gripped them as they heard the sound of rocks crashing down. They returned to Doraisamy’s home. There was no way they could communicate with anyone outside: the phones had long been dead and connectivity had ruptured. Difficulties in rescue operations It was only when the day broke that the magnitude of the catastrophe came into full view. The survivors alerted the Kanan Devan Hill Plantations (KDHP) officials and those manning the forest check post 10 km uphill in Rajamala. “A distraught man, who survived the ordeal, reached the check post at 7 a.m. The checkpost official informed me soon after,” says Job J. Neriamparambil, assistant wildlife warden of Eravikulam National Park. Neriamparambil was among the first to reach the site with a team. “We left in two vehicles but a minor landslip had washed away a portion of the road in front of the Rajamala hospital. We got down and resumed on foot negotiating through two more mudslides. There were uprooted trees along the way and water was flowing over a wooden bridge across a stream. When we finally reached Pettimudi by 10 a.m., there were two KDHP officials and around 15 workers from the two surviving layams. We were able to rescue three people from a collapsed tea stall in a corner of a partially destroyed building. In view of the magnitude of the devastation, we sent for reinforcements,” he says. It was still raining, which made rescue efforts difficult. Chances of further landslips were high as the stream that ran down the hill to the river below had changed course and looked menacingly swollen. Even after 10 hours of the disaster, it had a strong current, Neriamparambil recalls. The debris flow, he says, wasn’t straight down from the point of origin. The slurry zigzagged, depositing downhill huge rocks, boulders, tonnes of soil and fallen trees. “It was this winding motion that saved the two housing lines located above the destroyed ones,” he says. The hour of the occurrence and poor communication infrastructure apart, the region’s remoteness and continuing bad weather delayed rescue operations. Pettimudi is where the blacktopped road from Rajamala in the Eravikulam National Park to the Munnar Forest Division, a part of the Western Ghats bordering Tamil Nadu, ends. The only access to the area is through the national park, which was closed, and a temporary bridge at Periyavarai. The bridge, which links Pettimudi to Marayur, only partially constructed, had been washed away in the floods a few days earlier, making it difficult for rescuers and rescue gear to be transported to the spot. “It’s as if luck had eluded Pettimudi. Built by the British, the Periyavarai bridge was destroyed in the 2018 floods. The construction of a new bridge was still in progress,” says M.J. Babu, a native of Munnar who has authored a book on the Kanan Devan Hills. While BSNL restored cellular communication, the forest department reactivated official communication channels the next day. Connectivity to Marayur was also temporarily re-established. A contingent of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) reached the site by the evening of August 7. The rescue efforts were carried out by personnel from the Kerala forest, police, fire and rescue services besides scores of volunteers. “Debris had accumulated over the destroyed buildings at a height of 20 ft and there was water-logging. Even if we had arrived early, the chances of us finding anyone alive beneath the debris would have been remote,” says Rekha Nambiar, senior commandant of the NDRF Fourth Battalion that led the rescue effort. At least 16 bodies were fished out from a four-km stretch in the frenzied river below. There was fear of COVID-19, but locals like Hadley Renjith, a resident of Munnar, along with the police and forest officials, scoured the river banks from Anakkulam in Mankulam village some 12 km downstream all the way back up to the landslide site at Pettimudi, for bodies. The scenes at the site were heart-wrenching. Nineteen children died in the disaster. Among the casualties were 13 members from an extended family with a grandmother being the lone survivor. A disaster replay The disaster looked like a replay of the calamitous landslides of Kavalappara in Malappuram and Puthumala in Wayanad on August 8 last year. In all, 76 people had been either killed or termed missing in those landslides. This time around, a red alert for extremely heavy rainfall was sounded in Wayanad and Idukki districts on August 6. The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) recommended evacuating people in landslide-prone areas to safety during the day itself. But the labour lines of Pettimudi remained teeming with hapless people. Rainfall data from the gauging station at Eravikulam National Park suggest that Rajamala received 195 mm rain on August 4 and 309 mm rain on August 6. “Extremely heavy rains of 30 cm or more can trigger landslips,” explains K.S. Sajin Kumar, Assistant Professor of Geology at the University of Kerala who had studied the landslide susceptibility of Munnar in 2017. “Two factors contribute to landslides: static ones like the slope of a hill or its shape and triggering factors which include anthropogenic activities like deforestation, construction or land use. In the case of Pettimudi, the flat-topped hill would have caused all the rainwater to collect in a ravine before bursting through the topsoil. The sensitivity of the soil and the pattern of rock formation in the Munnar region came into focus following widening works on the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway along the gap road stretch, where over 20 major landslips have been reported since 2018,” he says. Sajin Kumar wants real-time rain gauging systems to be set up in all landslip-prone localities so that people can be moved to predetermined safer locations when excessive showers take place. Sajin Kumar calls for developing an accurate landslide susceptibility map and deploying early warning systems based on rainfall thresholds as these are critical for safe and sustainable planning and development of Kerala’s ecologically sensitive regions. According to KSDMA, the landslide susceptibility map was created by the National Centre for Earth Science Studies in 2010. The Geological Survey of India has completed a new landslide susceptibility map for all landslide-prone districts except Idukki, for which work is progressing under the National Landslide Susceptibility Mapping project. The State Revenue Department, on its part, intends to revise the State Disaster Management Plan once the battle against COVID-19 gets over. There’s an argument that setting up real-time rain gauges in all landslide-prone areas, about 15% of the State’s area, is unrealistic. But the government has identified 160 sites for the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to set up such a network. The IMD has already commissioned 15 such facilities in the State, according to the Revenue Department. Meanwhile, the Director of the National Centre for Earth Science Studies, V. Nandakumar, says the Centre has updated its landslide zonation map based on satellite data for Idukki and Wayanad districts. “The work for the landslide zonation map for Malappuram and Kozhikode is progressing. But it will take three years to validate it through field visits and further research. We also need to map all the landslides in which there were no loss of lives,” he says. Land use management policies Going by data collated by KSDMA, landslides claimed 177 lives in Kerala in 2018 and 2019. There were 1,362 landslides and 700 landslides in these two years, respectively. Idukki district, with 1,048 landslides, topped the vulnerability chart in this period. Except for the estuarine Alappuzha, all the 13 districts are considered landslide-prone. The Geological Survey of India has found that of Kerala’s 39,000 sq km area, hills having slopes of over 10 degree constitute about 19,000 sq km. “Kerala has witnessed unusually high rainfall since 2018, which has destabilised the already vulnerable hill slopes in the high ranges. Some of them, which may not have seen landslides in the past, are now becoming potentially vulnerable to heavy sliding. The Pettimudi slide is a repeat of what happened in Puthumala. I understand that the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel led by Madhav Gadgil had designated the Pettimudi locality as a region of highest ecological sensitivity,” says C.P. Rajendran, geoscientist and professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research in Bengaluru. Human activity exacerbates the vulnerability caused by climate change, he says, and points to the need for formulation of appropriate land use management policies in vulnerable districts like Idukki and Wayanad – something that the government is looking at as part of its Rebuild Kerala Initiative. The researchers of the Geological Survey of India who had studied 10 landslides in Idukki between June and July in 2018 had cited human interference and unscientific land use among the ‘geo-scientific causes’ that triggered landslides. The man-made causative factors, they said, included construction of buildings with loose material, faulty cultivation patterns and defective maintenance of drainage systems. The human factor played no role in Pettimudi, as the crest of the slide was deep inside the pristine forests, says A. Jayathilak, Principal Secretary, Revenue and Disaster Management, Kerala. “There were also no quarries or resorts nearby. Extreme rainfall triggered the landslide and it gathered high intensity as it came down the hill,” he says. In a land-scarce State like Kerala, it’s impractical to demarcate land as habitable areas and strictly as no-go zones. “The people in the lowlands and the highlands cannot be relocated to the relatively safer mid-lands considering the large population that would require relocation. If we go by the maps, just about 20% to 30% of the land is habitable and it’s the mid-lands,” Jayathilak says. But that shouldn’t deter the State from formulating a land use policy, contends Harish Vasudevan, environmentalist and lawyer. “Just look at the sheer scale of land grab in these hilly districts. In Idukki alone, thousands of acres of land have been encroached on using fake land deeds,” he says. The Pettimudi tragedy has also exposed the class divide. The tribals, estate workers and the fishermen are deprived of their rightful ownership of habitable land. “The government should have put the taluk land boards in mission mode to identify areas for the safe relocation of the landless and the marginalised,” he says. It’s an argument upheld by the plantation workers of Munnar who continue to live in the Raj-era labour lines on hill slopes without ownership while the managerial staff reside in posh bungalows atop hills. The plantation sector might have witnessed mechanisation and kept pace with the times, but the lot of the estate workers has remained unchanged, they say. An official of the KDHP states that the company has allotted accommodation to the families from Pettimudi that have lost their living quarters in the landslip. It’s also providing assistance to the few surviving kin of the deceased. “The layams remain one of the best models of safe living,” says Mohan C. Varghese, KDHP vice president. “It’s a solid structure and a safe building to live in. We have not had any such incident in the last 70-80 years,” he says, blaming the tragedy on the excessive downpour. The company says it’s carrying out annual maintenance of the lines, which are electrified and with basic amenities. “But the workers’ lives will not improve unless there is a major revision of the labour laws,” says Gomathi, a member of the Devikulam Block Panchayat and leader of the iconic Pengal Otrumai collective, a women’s movement that led a strike against labour exploitation in the tea plantation sector in Munnar in 2015. “There’s been an increase in the wages earned by workers over the years. But in comparison with the rising costs of living, that’s a pittance. Climate change may have made landslides inescapable, but does that mean people should die? Unless the government acts, there are many Pettimudis waiting to happen in Munnar,” she says mincing no words.  Kerala has witnessed unusually high rainfall since 2018, which has destabilised the already vulnerable hill slopes in the high ranges. Some of them, which may not have seen landslides in the past, are now becoming potentially vulnerable to heavy sliding. C.P.

29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||National well-being and the counts that matter||Since India’s crimes data recording system is not built to capture subtleties, we do not know what proportion of pregnancies in India start off without the consent of the woman, even though the veil of marriage may cover it legally and culturally. While physical and mental violence can be ascertained by a sensitive clinician, the intergenerational impact of a regretful and anxiety-loaded pregnancy is inadequately quantified by current clinical or epidemiological tools. Measuring and tracking matters of import is critical to individual, community as well as national well-being. Parameters that are valuable If we equally value all Indians, we should not stick to decennial census operations alone and count ourselves the way we do — on lines that tell us how we can be sorted and addressed in the political economy; rather, we should do so to understand what our cumulative human capital and potential look like. What is valuable is measured frequently, at different life stages, and at disaggregated levels: birthweights; the heights and weights of our children when they enter school; school completion rates; perhaps the age, height and weight of a first-time pregnant woman; and most definitely, the number of women in the formal workforce who are on a par with men in terms of earning. Underage marriage of girls must become history. Ensuring secondary school completion of every child, especially girls in rural areas, has far-reaching impact, and needs to be pursued single-mindedly. Provisioning separate, functional toilets and sanitary pads for girls, and teaching boys biology and gender differences (of their own and female) are key enablers to ensuring gender parity in school completion rates. Teaching school-leaving girls and boys the notion of consent, and also the basics of contraception, will ensure that the start of every pregnancy will be a desired and happy one. Births in the country Not every pregnancy ends up in a live birth — evocatively captured by the six-word allegedly Hemingway novel: “For sale: baby shoes, never worn”. A desired pregnancy is to be supported by a fully functional health-care system, able to anticipate complications before time and facilitating a safe delivery. Current stillbirth numbers in India are hard to pin down, but after accounting for background losses and abortions, there still remains a distressingly large number of still births, sometimes mis-recorded as early neonatal deaths. Despite the trend towards nuclear families, pregnancies in India still are familial events — outcomes are eagerly anticipated by more than just the parents, and stillbirths are a rude end to many fond wishes. A young, short and under-schooled woman is more likely to have a bad pregnancy outcome, or, a smaller than expected baby. A birth weight is much more than a number — it is a complex outcome, telling of how well the woman and her family eats, her status among them, and also of any particular condition that the individual mother or newborn child has. Tracking average birthweights by district and subdistrict on a regular basis is a fair proxy for food security, the status of women and the delivery of primary health care. For a nation with plans to assign digital health IDs to everyone, this is not a tall ask — what is additionally required is the making of this moving average data live and visible to the people and their government. It should also put to rest all debate about whether some Indians are born more equal than others. Height-weight proportions A good start is a great advantage, but easily squandered if subsequent growth and development are blighted by the lack of adequate nutrition, first exclusively from the mother’s breast, then through locally available weaning and complementary foods; and repeated bouts of vaccine preventable or easily treatable illnesses. Parental hopes of a child growing up, going to school and becoming successful hit a major hurdle if the height-weight proportions at age five are not normal. Ensuring this marker is recorded for every child who enters school will also allow for a correlation with birthweights at the district level — giving a better understanding of multi-dimensional property. If India is to be truly taking advantage of its large birth cohort in the form of a demographic dividend, then the correlate of birthweight and five-year height-weight needs to be reviewed at the highest political levels regularly. It reflects the physical and cognitive nurture of human capital that the country can bank on for its future. Every child born in India is to be considered a ratna – a jewel and handled as such; some of them will go on to get the formal Bharat Ratna tag eventually. Improved learning Schooling is a socio-economic and gender parity springboard if school completion rates show no gender, rural-urban or parental income divides. Consequently, India may not only bring down its maternal mortality ratios but also improve neonatal and under five mortality rates, through delayed marriages and exercising of reproductive choices by its empowered young women. Grading cognitively ill-equipped or ill-taught children on standardised tests is as much a waste of effort as letting large numbers of young people graduate through courses which are hopelessly out of sync with the expectations of the job interview board. The recently unveiled new education policy seeks to remedy this. It will be a while before we can measure any of the talked about, and hopefully intended, outputs or impact of this policy. Unimaginative teaching of anaemic children is a double whammy, partially addressed through protein rich mid-day meals. Deworming, school toilets, sanitary pads and bicycles for girls are progressive policy steps in the right direction; adding remedial training and affirmative feedback for teachers will be transformative. With better cognitive capacities and supportive environment, the stress of learning reduces, and outcomes improve. Improved learning should translate into better completion rates at post-secondary and baccalaureate levels but need not necessarily correspond to universal, meaningful employment. It is for the government and the corporate world to make opportunities and workplaces happen, irrespective of their gender. Right economic stimuli, anticipating potential workplace disruptions, supporting reskilling and retraining, and decriminalising entrepreneurial failure will go a long way in eliminating work and livelihood-related anxieties making their way back home as domestic violence. As a society, we need to understand and make leeway for failure, and not stigmatise it, whether at school in early childhood, during miscarriages of pregnancies, or when career and business decisions go awry. Stigma erodes self-worth and kills silently. Timely data helps Together, these measurements will tell us far more about where we are, and where we as a nation will go. The tools to get these measurements exist; we just have to see them in real time to be able to take corrective actions where needed. Public health is about people, their continued well-being, and not just about controlling disease outbreaks. Data helps; timely, disaggregated, multidimensional data helps immensely in ensuring collective well being, physical, mental and social. People are India’s greatest possession and will remain so for the conceivable future, provided they are in a state of well-being. An ill-educated, anxious population is a tinderbox, capable of self-harm as well as being kindling for malice-driven mobilisation. Addressing this requires a whole of life and whole of society approach, and measuring the outcomes that matter, regularly. Hopefully the 2017 edition of the national health policy and the new education policy unveiled last month will be the twin rails that India rides towards a true demographic dividend.

29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||In ‘act of god’, coercive not cooperative federalism||It is beyond anyone’s imagination that the Government of India would invoke the “Force Majeure” clause against its own people. Unfortunately, this has become reality at a time when every Indian State is massively burdened by the COVID-19 crisis and governance has been severely affected. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s statement on Thursday that the financial crisis facing the States is a result of an “act of God” is symptomatic of the callousness with which the Narendra Modi government treats State governments. This abdication of responsibility strikes a cruel blow to the social contract that exists between the Government of India and State governments, who are equal representatives of the 1.3 billion citizens of India. The basis The Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime was built on the promise that if States faced revenue deficits after the GST’s introduction, the Centre would make good the loss in the first five years. It was on the basis of this commitment that States extended their support to GST. States sacrificed their constitutionally granted powers of taxation in the national interest. That allowed the Centre to announce the dawn of “one nation one tax” at the stroke of midnight in 2017! When the GST compensation cess exceeded the amount that had to be paid to States, the Central government absorbed the surplus. Now, the economy has slowed down dramatically and the resources raised are insufficient. Instead of exploring other viable options, the Centre is orchestrating a charade and raising questions about whether it is legally accountable to pay compensation. A reading of the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act 2017 and the Constitution 101st Amendment answer these questions affirmatively. Alas, the government’s objective is to obfuscate. It is one thing to say that there are no funds available but entirely another to assert that there is no commitment to pay compensation. This commitment has a history that begins with United Progressive Alliance era when many Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled States strongly pitched for a compensation mechanism to be a part of the Constitution itself. Paragraph 92 of the Standing Committee report shows that the Centre assured payment of compensation for a specified period, if there were such a loss. Assurances made When the Narendra Modi government introduced the GST compensation cess, many States pointed out that proceeds from the cess may be inadequate to fund the losses faced by States after the rollout of GST. Allaying these apprehensions, the central government made the assurance that it would provide funds to meet States’ deficits. In the seventh meeting of the GST Council, the Chairman (then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley), observed that it was the constitutional commitment of the central government to provide cent per cent compensation. This was reinforced in the eight meeting of the Council. In the tenth meeting, the Secretary of the GST Council stated that the central government could raise resources by other means for compensation and this could then be recouped by continuing the cess beyond five years. Therefore, there was never any ambiguity in the minds of States that succour will be offered by the Centre. The constitutional framework that ushered in the GST does not provide an escape clause for ‘Acts of God’. States never expected to be disappointed so early. The central government has let them down by thrusting on them two options, both of which involve borrowing by States. This is akin to asking States to mortgage their future to sustain the present. Cooperative federalism has been transformed into coercive federalism. Centre is best placed The central government has the ability to raise resources through means that are not available to States. Monetary measures are the monopoly of the central government. Even borrowing is more efficient and less expensive if it is undertaken by the Central government. Over the last six years, the Centre has continually cornered resources that should have been shared with States. The Fourteenth Finance Commission allotted 42% of central government tax revenues to States. However, Accountability Initiative’s analysis of State Budgets shows that States received only 30%of central tax collections during the 2015-19 period. The Centre raised an estimated Rs. 3,69,111 crore revenue through cesses and surcharges in 2019-20 alone. These are not shareable with States. Similarly, cesses on petroleum products have resulted in the Centre receiving 60% of petroleum tax revenues, with only 40% going to States. In 2013-14, the ratio was 50-50. Equal representatives As equal representatives of the citizens of the federal republic of India, State governments expected the Centre to demonstrate empathy when they are bearing the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns that were announced without consultation. This is the most appropriate time to provide them relief through the Consolidated Fund of India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi proudly described GST as a ‘Good and Simple Tax’ which would usher in a glorious economic future for India. Unfortunately, just three years later, the harsh reality is that States are staring at ‘grave and sordid times’ ahead. Manpreet Singh Badal is Finance Minister of Punjab.

29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Targeting Hezbollah||The Israeli attacks on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon following what it called “cross border fires” mark a significant escalation in the crisis that has been building up along the border in recent years. Hezbollah, a Shia militia-cum-political party in Lebanon, and Israel, which have fought two wars before, have been observing a tenuous ceasefire for 14 years. Tensions began after Israel’s targeting of Iranian weapons and supplies within Syria. Israel fears that Iranian supplies to Hezbollah via Syria, where the Shia militias fought alongside regime fighters against rebels and Sunni jihadists, would leave them stronger, enhancing Israel’s security challenges in the northern border. In July, a Hezbollah commander was killed in an Israeli raid in Syria for which the group had vowed retaliation. Since then, there have been attempts to target troops on Israel’s borders with Lebanon and Syria, according to Israel. In Tuesday’s attacks, Israel targeted an observation post, which the Israeli Defense Forces claimed was used by Hezbollah for intelligence collection. The raid, at a time when Israel was carrying out an air campaign in Gaza, shows the growing appetite of the newly formed unity government of Netanyahu, under fire at home over its handling of the COVID-19 crisis, for war as a means to address the simmering border problems. Hezbollah has been a tough target for Israel. In 2000, after 18 years of occupation of southern Lebanon, Israel was forced to withdraw mainly due to the fighting of Hezbollah. In 2006, Israel invaded Lebanon, aimed at destroying Hezbollah’s military capabilities. But after a month of Israeli aerial and land attacks, even on the day of the ceasefire, Hezbollah fired hundreds of short-range rockets into northern Israel. Ever since, both sides have been wary of another open conflict. Israel, which has bombed Gaza several times since its 2005 withdrawal from the strip, had been careful when it came to Hezbollah. The militants, on the other side, turned their focus to capacity building after the 2006 war, and, since 2011, to the civil war in Syria. The Baathist Syria has been a vital link between Hezbollah and Iran ever since the group was founded in the early 1980s. Mr. Assad has survived the civil war, and Iran has substantially increased its footprint in Syria, bolstering the Iran-Syria-Hezbollah axis. Israel sees this axis as a growing security challenge and hence, started the bombing operations in Syria, risking another conflict with Hezbollah. The past two wars suggest that it would not be easy for Israel, despite its military might, to defeat the battle-hardened Hezbollah fighters at their base. Hezbollah, on the other side, might resist an Israeli attack, but risks pulling Lebanon, already battling an economic crisis, political instability and the after-effects of the Beirut blast, into a wider war. Both sides should avert such an outcome and stick to the ceasefire.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/targeting-hezbollah/article32470304.ece
29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Conventional dissonance||There are few events in U.S. election politics that offer a more predictable denouement than the National Conventions of the two major parties, given that the presidential and vice-presidential tickets for both are known beforehand. Yet even this low bar of dull certainty was scarcely surpassed by the Republican Party as it reaffirmed its faith in a President who has shredded its ideological moorings and dug his heels in in defending the record of his first term in office, including an impeachment on allegations of abuse of power and obstructing justice. The Convention culminated with Mr. Trump’s address in which he appeared to fall back upon the same lines of political attack that he employed against former Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, only this time against Democratic nominee and former Vice-President Joe Biden. In doing so, Mr. Trump conjured up, once again, the spectres of socialism and globalisation that threatened to creep upon the U.S. economy should Mr. Biden prevail in the 2020 election, warning that the latter was the “destroyer of America’s jobs… [who] took the donations of blue-collar workers… [but] voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands”. It is unlikely that many among the party faithful who thronged to the Convention questioned his basic premise regarding the danger posed by the Democratic Party to the economy: that there are jobs aplenty and the pandemic is a thing of the past. Nothing could undermine that assertion more than the fact that unemployment rates are still high, and that during the time of the Convention, more than 3,600 people succumbed to COVID-19 in the U.S. As disturbing as the false claims made about the economy and the pandemic were, more deleterious for the future of U.S. societal harmony was the strident note that the President struck regarding racial tensions that have flared up across the country following several deaths of unarmed African-Americans at the hands of armed police. Leaving little doubt as to which side of the line he stood on, Mr. Trump said he “condemns the rioting, looting, arson and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago and New York”. Little wonder that police brutality of the kind that was inflicted upon Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has continued to foment anger in the streets of that city, and that Mr. Trump’s regular allusions to “mob rule” by “thugs” associated with the Democratic Party is likely costing him what little support he might enjoy with minorities of all hues. When November 3 rolls around, it might take Team Trump more than a vicious attack on mail-in voting to prevent this broad sense of anger in multicultural America from drowning out its political ambitions for a second term.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/conventional-dissonance/article32470303.ece
29 August 2020||Chennai,||COVID-19 affects the Super Kings camp||A team known for its resilience and the ability to fight back has been rocked even before the first ball has been bowled in the upcoming IPL. An India cricketer in the Chennai Super Kings squad and several members of its support staff and social media team have tested positive for COVID-19 in Dubai, where the team is based. The competition begins in the UAE on September 19. It is believed the India cricketer to have tested positive is swing bowler Deepak Chahar, who has been a vital part of the CSK attack over the past two years with his control and movement, both at the beginning and the end of the innings. Contact tracing Then, a few members of the support staff and the side’s social media team also failed the COVID test. To prevent the virus from spreading further, the authorities have already commenced ‘contact tracing’. The team underwent a test upon landing on August 21, after which it was tested on Days 1, 3 and 6. Everyone came out clean in the first three tests. But the test on Thursday proved a stumbling block. Those who failed the test underwent another one on Friday, conducted by the Dubai health authority and the BCCI. The names will be released officially on Saturday. Additional quarantine The positive results mean CSK has to undergo one more week of quarantine and will be able to begin its practice sessions only on September 1. Only then it will be able to enter the IPL’s ‘bio-bubble,’ a secure environment where the players will have to wear wrist bands so that their movements can be tracked. As for the CSK player and support staff, who have tested positive now, they will, according to the tournament’s SOP, be isolated from the squad and quarantined for a couple of weeks after which they will have to clear two COVID tests before becoming eligible to compete. Since the tournament begins only on September 19, they can still recover and be available for the first game. Chennai camp Ahead of its campaign in the UAE, CSK had a five-day training session in Chennai where the side underwent two COVID tests. The players and the support staff came through them without any damage. Despite reservations from team CEO K.S. Viswanathan about having the camp in Chennai, CSK went ahead after skipper M.S. Dhoni insisted on it since the players were rusty following a lengthy lay off. And before coming to Chennai, the CSK cricketers were tested once. Under the circumstances, these results in Dubai have come as a shock. Match schedule Although the tournament will begin on September 19, the schedule of matches is yet to be released. Ideally, the first game would have been between last-year’s runner-up CSK and winner Mumbai Indians. Now it remains to be seen if this clash would be the lung-opener. The Chennai side is facing a few problems at the moment. But, with its inspirational skipper M.S. Dhoni around to lift the side, CSK can bounce back.

29 August 2020||Spa-Francorchamps,||Max Verstappen sets the pace||Red Bull’s Max Verstappen topped the practice timesheets for the Belgian Grand Prix on Friday, ahead of Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo and championship leader Lewis Hamilton. The Dutchman, third fastest in the first of Friday’s two 90-minute sessions, vaulted to the top in the afternoon with a time of one minute, 43.744 seconds. That put him a mere 0.048 seconds clear of Ricciardo with Hamilton also hot on his heels just 0.096 seconds behind. “It’s very close out there,” said Hamilton, who completed a Mercedes one-two behind teammate and birthday boy Valtteri Bottas in the morning. “I think the Red Bulls are just a little bit quicker at the moment but even Racing Point is right with us...” Hamilton, who has won four of this season’s six races, is 37 points clear of Verstappen at the top.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/max-verstappen-sets-the-pace/article32470449.ece
29 August 2020||NICE,||Bernal again a good bet for the yellow jersey||There are always sunshine and smiles on the French Riviera but the 2020 Tour de France will roll out from here on Saturday under a cloud of Covid-19 gloom, with doubts the 21-day jaunt across the peaks and plains will be end with its usual dash up the Champs Elysees in Paris. Leaving the well heeled Riviera resort the 22 teams will race 3,484km through some of the prettiest vistas in France in a globally popular event broadcast in 190 countries. The organisers of the Grand Boucle, as it is known, also hope to provide a new blueprint for sports in the time of Covid-19. Defending champion Colombian Egan Bernal is again a good bet for the overall leader’s fabled yellow jersey, along with Slovenian strongman Primoz Roglic and emotional French climber Thibaut Pinot chief among his rivals on a course that crosses all five of France’s mountain ranges. Bernal’s Ineos team boss, Dave Brailsford, told on Friday that he had stuck with his 21-day masterplan for an eighth victory in nine years because he felt the Tour would indeed make it all the way to the cobbles of the Champs Elysees. The real action is likely to be the war of attrition between the two strongest teams Ineos and Jumbo. Both squads will be concerned that limited warm-up time could make the race less predictable and wary of outliers capable of summoning a massive climb performance. Whoever emerges from the sunflowers and the chateaux, wearing the yellow jersey atop the popular culminating climb of La Planche des Belles Filles, will have won one of the most hotly anticipated Tours in its 107 year history.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bernal-again-a-good-bet-for-the-yellow-jersey/article32470448.ece
29 August 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Lakshadweep Islands to have more Kerala barn owls to kill rats||Three pairs of barn owls shipped to the Lakshadweep Islands from Kerala in 2019 have apparently proven such skilful slayers of pesky rats which have been ravaging the coconut plantations that the Union Territory is hoping to recruit more of the “winged assassins”. The Lakshadweep Administration had embarked on the ‘Pilot project on Biological Control of Rodents (Rats) by Using Barn Owls (Tyto alba) in Kavaratti Island’ after studies revealed the shocking extent of damage caused by rats to the island's coconut yield and economy. According to a recent report by the Departments of Agriculture, and Environment and Forest, Lakshadweep, and the Krishi Vigyan Kendra under the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, initial data shows that the owls are working wonders. So much so that the report recommends expansion of the project by recruiting more barn owls to “guard” the coconut plantations. It also plans to extend the project to other islands in the archipelago. The pilot project “has created a new hope among the public of Lakshadweep to manage the rodent menace effectively”, the report notes, adding that the birds “are completely healthy and have adapted to the island conditions”. The barn owl population in Kavaratti, it says, has also increased with the hatching of several owlets. The islands have no other natural predators of rodents. Using chemical agents is impossible since Lakshadweep practises organic agriculture. Moreover, coconut trees on the islands are so closely planted that their fronds overlap, allowing rats to practically live atop the trees, which is the primary reason why the administration hit upon the idea of barn owls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/lakshadweep-islands-to-have-more-kerala-barn-owls-to-kill-rats/article32470445.ece
29 August 2020||Southampton,||CA curbs use of sweat||Cricket Australia (CA) has restricted its players from using sweat from the head, face and neck to shine the ball during the upcoming limited-overs tour of England in a bid to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Based on medical advice, CA has asked its players not to use sweat from near the mouth or nose, according to Cricket.com.au . This leaves players with the option of using sweat from either the stomach or back. The team’s premier pacer Mitchell Starc feels the regulation will not have much affect in the limited-overs formats. “It’s more of a question for red-ball cricket,” Starc said. Rain affected Meanwhile, Australia’s first intra-squad practice match was abandoned midway because of rain on Friday. Rain stopped play in the Twenty20 hit-out when a team led by vice-captain Pat Cummins was on 60 for no loss in reply to the 150 made by an opposition side captained by Australia’s limited-overs skipper, Aaron Finch. Just 25.5 overs were possible in total. Finch and fellow opener David Warner put on a stand of 75 in 9.2 overs for the Finch XI.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ca-curbs-use-of-sweat/article32470447.ece

The Orange Army has devised a virtual campaign to keep the morale of SRH players high by engaging itself on social networking platforms like Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Hailing COVID workers “The campaign includes presenting a specially-designed badge to COVID-19 frontline warriors. It is a different kind of challenge too to engage in a virtual campaign,” says D.B. Sathish Kumar of the Orange Army. “The T20 extravaganza in the UAE can now be the one-stop destination for fans to unite with their families and watch non-stop, electrifying action,” he says. There would be no decrease in the passion or intensity of the around 23,000 fan base, he added. Fan-of-the-week segment Orange Army core team member Thakur Manish Singh says quiz programmes have been planned and a ‘fan of the week’ segment, where the most colourful and passionate fans will be in the forefront of the campaign. Also specially-designed wallpapers will be circulated on Whatsapp groups, he said. “Yes, we are proud of every member of the team and also the inspirational support staff which includes some of the legends of the game like V.V.S.

29 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Sarfaraz — earning his wings as a mountaineer||Col. Sarfaraz Singh had just completed the National Integration Trekking Expedition to Gorichen Glacier and was somewhere in the vicinity of 19,000 feet, on his way to the Gorichen Peak with his team, when he was informed about being one of the recipients of this year’s Tenzing Norgay National Adventure Award. A member of the elite 6th Battalion of the Parachute Regiment, Sarfaraz is more than just a mountaineer, although his achievements as one are quite distinguished. He is also a sky-diver, a combat free faller and a certified Scuba Rescue Diver. On the mountains, he has summited the highest peaks in the four continents — Mt. Everest (Asia), Mt. Aconcagua (Argentina, Americas), Mt. Elbrus (Russia, Europe) and Mt. Kilimanjaro (Tanzania, Africa). Pedigree His lineage is equally accomplished — he is the son of Arjuna Awardee Col. Balbir Singh Kular, who won hockey bronze at the Mexico Olympics, and a fourth generation armyman. “People tell me I have an Arjuna and now my son has also got this award but honestly, I think he has achieved something far greater than me. This award is much, much bigger and I am proud of his achievements, both in the armed forces and on the mountains,” an emotional Balbir said. An alumnus of the RIMC, the NDA and the IMA, Sarfaraz excelled at boxing and squash. With service rules barring him from indulging in contact sports professionally, it was his induction into the Para Regiment in 2001 that gave him a taste for adventure sports, beginning with the Army’s 2004 expedition to the 7,105 m high Mt. Nun in Ladakh. “I was deputy to Brig. Saurabh Singh Shekhawat there and he was the first person I called up to inform about this award and dedicate it to him,” the 43-year old Sarfaraz said. And for all the gratitude he has for the award, he cannot wait to join his team on the next expedition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sarfaraz-earning-his-wings-as-a-mountaineer/article32470641.ece

29 August 2020||KOZHKODE,||India in semis||India reached the semifinals of the online Chess Olympiad in controversial circumstances on Friday. It had won the first of the two matches against Armenia, which didn’t play the second and withdrew from the competition. The Armenians protested with FIDE claiming that they lost one game because of loss of internet connection on Chess.com ’s end. They argued that the internet connection was fine on their side and the game between Nihal Sarin and Haik Martirosyan should be replayed from the position in which the Armenian had lost on time. The Indian non-playing captain N. Srinath was asked by FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich about India’s stand. Srinath’s firm stand “I said that they could investigate the internet issue but we could not wait indefinitely for the second match to start as it would be unfair to our players,” Srinath told The Hindu over phone from Chennai. “Then some two hours later, I was told that Armenia withdrew.” He said it wasn’t the way India wanted to reach the semifinals. “But we are still delighted that we are through,” he said. “We should not forget that Nihal was slightly better in the final position, and Martirosyan needed accurate moves — that too in severe time pressure — to force a draw.” In the other games, Viswanathan Anand drew with Levon Aronian, Gujrathi defeated Gabriel Sargissian, Koneru Humpy lost to Elina Danielian, Dronavalli Harika beat Lilit Mkrtchian and Vantika Agrawal went down to Anna Sargsyan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-in-semis-as-armenia-withdraws/article32470446.ece

29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||The proof of a kabab...||There’s so much food talk on social media it’s driving me crazy. Not because I am weary of conversations revolving around food, but because the more I read, the more I want to eat. Take, for instance, this thread on Awadhi food that had me drooling. This page was brought to my notice by a foodie friend who lives in Gurugram. She sent me a message about Arq that had been delivering the most delicious kababs and pulaos, and promised to get me some one day. That one day arrived last week, and what a pleasant day it was. One, we were meeting two of our dearest friends after eons (with our masks and social distancing in place). And, two, what a delicious hamper they carried for us! The food — yakhni meat pulao, shaami kabab and Ghar Ka Salan — was from Arq. Somehow, our friends thought that we had a wedding at home, for they’d got food for a full baraat . Not that we complained: instead, we dug into the food with relish (and continued to do so for a couple of days after). Arq is run by a food lover called Anamika Bajpai, who is from Lucknow, and grew up in a largely vegetarian home. But Anamika’s interest in various kinds of cuisines — including good old Awadhi non-vegetarian fare — prompted her to throw up her corporate job during the pandemic, and start a food delivery service. She is based in Gurugram, and most of her clientele is there. But food is delivered across Delhi-NCR through a service at an extra cost (9315480032; menu at: Facebook.com/arq.online.ggn/menu). I enjoyed the shaami kabab the most. The kababs that we generally get are of minced meat, but I really love the ones that are a bit stringy, prepared with beaten meat. That gives an added texture, a chewiness that is surprisingly tasty. Arq’s kabab was like that, and not crumbly as kababs can be. The menu card describes it as “Reshe Waaley Shaami — gloriously meaty and reshe-daar”. I must say that’s true. The delicious yakhni pulao, cooked in meat stock with saffron and milk, had the robust flavours of whole spices such as black cardamom and mace. The gravy in the meat curry — called Ghar Ka Salan — was light and not thick or heavy like a korma . It reminded me of all those home-cooked mutton curries, prepared for Sunday lunches. Anamika tells me that she was always interested in food, but picked up the finer nuances of Laknavi cuisine from a host of books that she pored over to gather just the right recipes. The rates are a bit high, perhaps, but good mutton is expensive, and Anamika gets most of her fragrant spices from Kerala. The Arq Special Mutton Boti costs Rs. 1100 for half a kilo. All mutton dishes (500g) are priced at Rs. 900, and chicken based dishes (500g) at Rs. 750. Vegetarian dishes cost Rs. 650 for half a kilo.

The clothes are still starched stiff using rice water, and dried in a particular fashion. So, when Save The Loom Founder Ramesh Menon approached them with his saris and requested that they wash and unstarch them, they were surprised. Why give clothes for unstarching to a community famous for its “stiff finish”? Because Ramesh wanted a luxurious feel (of cotton fabric) and hoped that all work could be done in and around Chendamangalam. It has resulted in Save The Loom’s Olam (wave) line, which features 12 designs in 24 variants (colour, reversibility and so on). Another line, in association with actor and founder of Clothes Without Borders, Amalda Liz, features a range of floral prints on saris and textiles, naturally dyed from flowers sourced in Kerala. And as it was with his conceptual space, One Zero Eight, during Kochi-Muziris Biennale 2018, Menon is counting on the stories to drive these collections. Starting at the loom Weavers work hard at the looms and create yards of fine fabric, which are picked up by others in the design chain and transformed into high-fashion garments worth a fortune. But how much does the weaver benefit? Olam and Amalda focus on this aspect of the creative chain, and on gainfully employing more local communities, be it to unstarch or tie simple tassels. Both lines are made of fabric that is 94% cotton (kasavu (zari) makes up the rest) from Chendamangalam, which bore the brunt of the 2018 floods in Kerala and is the home of the Chekutty dolls. The collections are a follow-up to the philosophy of Save Your Loom: it’s not enough to just fix broken looms and get them running; there is a need to mainstream the artisans too. “It helps that Chendamangalam has a huge cultural relevance too. Just six years ago, you could hear the clacking of thousands of looms when you entered the place; now, the number of weavers has reduced from 6,000 to just about 430. The need is to not just sustain weaving but also make it aspirational. The issues are many and we wanted to tell multiple stories, we wanted to sustain the revived interest,” says Menon.   The happiness project  Menon believes that only a happy weaver, assured of at least basic needs, will create happy handloom. “Else, it is not worth creating this product by hand. The human being involved must be in a safe, content space,” he says. For the exhibition at the 2018 Biennale, Menon sent the traditional khadi thorthu and mundu from Chendamangalam to leading Indian designers who created garments that were new age and unusual. “We know we have a great product, but the things that bring in value addition are done in other States (cotton yarn from Tamil Nadu, zari invariably from Surat, post-weaving processes in Tamil Nadu. Now, we are seeing if the 28 days of processing cotton to yarn to weave can take place in Kerala. It will also increase the number of people finding employment.” Ironically, the funds for this upskilling exercise came from Tamil Nadu Foundation, created in 1983 by a group of Americans of Tamil origin. Stripes and blooms While the Olam saris come in uncommon stripes that accentuate the drape, it also minimises kasavu to a large extent. “So, the sari is not ornamental, but can be worn on a regular basis, in everyday life,” says Menon. Meanwhile, each piece in the second line, Amalda, is one of a kind, decided by time and how flowers stain the fabric. “There are a lot of people experimenting in the natural dye space. We have over 4,500 varieties of flowers in Kerala, 900 of which have medicinal properties. Amalda Liz has involved herself in textile explorations using natural elements in Kerala to engage people in the tribal belt,” adds Menon, sharing plans to work with Kerala Agricultural University. They are also exploring if floral waste generated by temples can be upcycled and used in textiles. Collaboration increases possibilities for both the craft and the improvement of human lives. “A couple, could, for instance, want the leftover flowers from their wedding to stain a fabric, as a keepsake,” observes Menon. But for now, this update to the traditional kasavu sari comes just in time for one of Kerala’s most important festivals, Onam.  The Olam collection   is priced between Rs. 4,500   and Rs. 6,800, while Amalda is upwards of Rs. 7,500.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/everyday-saris-and-flower-stains/article32470243.ece
29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Open letter to namma Kamala||Our Dear Kamala, As you know it’s been a week of mixed fortunes for us. On one hand, while Chennai was declared third most asingam city in India, you, dear girl, have been selected to be Joe Biden’s running mate. It is a huge victory for all of us Madras- vasis and an even bigger one for us elite Besant Nagar nivasis (even though, personally, I’m not in favour of the word ‘mate’ or that it is preceded by the word ‘running’). Just the other day, as I was reading Tangy Tart Hot & Sweet (not an autobiography, I caution readers), I realised that its author, Padma Lakshmi, is a Besant Nagar ponnu , too. While she is currently ruling the culinary world dressed in fetching gear, with her recipes of curd rice with manga thokku , you, precious child, will be ruling, well, the world. What a double coincidence that your names, Padma and Kamala, both mean lotus. You can’t imagine how proud that makes us feel. First things first. What are you going to do for Us ? That’s how you should see the post of VP of US. I have a few ideas. Your hometown’s reputation, as you know, has taken a blow. Please direct NASA to shoot some purifying lasers every day at us to vaporise the morning asingam along our beautiful coastline. It is all that rampant Number One and Number Two which has put our city at Number Three. Secondly, and this is important, could you reduce the onslaught of classical danseuses who arrive in droves here every December? It is becoming difficult for us, dear. The arangetram upon arangetram of hapless US-born Indian children at various sabhas has taken a serious toll on our collective health. Tell the Bay Area Akkas to slow down, no? Would be eternally grateful if you could put an embargo of some sort. Now that we have got what you can do for Us in your janmabhoomi out of the way, let us come to the equally important matter of what you can do for Us in your karmabhoomi . As prescribed by the Vedas , all Besant Nagar residents have a minimum of one sibling in America. And despite our best efforts, we have to visit during kolus , graduations and proms from time to time. Whenever I visit my brother-in-law, and he takes us to the neighbourhood temple or the microbrewery depending on what day of the week it is, I find it hard to be neatly attired. It is impossible to have properly ironed clothes in the US. My suggestion is that you give Marimuthu, our local istriwallah , a visa on a war footing. The gated community in Seattle I frequent sure could do with one. It will be only a matter of time before Marimuthu, resourceful fellow that he is, sets up istri vandis all across the US with his many cousins who run a sort of an istri mafia in Besant Nagar, and ensures Americans finally have pants that have a respectable crease. Similarly, I think the US needs potti kadais , too. Whenever I go on my evening stroll, I kind of miss my ritual of lighting up a Gold Flake Kings, sucking on a kadalai muttai , and greeting everyone who passes by with a cheery ‘Wassup, thambi ’. Next step, auto-rickshaws, and Kamala ponnu , you chaps can call yourselves a truly developed nation. Also, if possible, alter spelling to Harish. Trust me, you’ll defeat Biden and become Prez. Then nobody can stop Us. With blessings, Kittu Chittappa Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/open-letter-to-namma-kamala/article32470247.ece
29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||‘I’m being sold my own prints, someone thinks I’m a country in Africa’||At the crack of dawn, a distraught Masaba Gupta, dressed in a bright scarlet gown, walks down an empty Mumbai street to her mother’s home. She has just announced her separation with her husband on Instagram after a short-lived marriage. This opening shot of her semi-autobiographical series, Masaba Masaba , aptly sums up her relationship with her mother, Neena Gupta, who raised her single-handedly. When life throws her a curveball, the 31-year-old fashion designer and entrepreneur runs to her mother for comfort. Growing up, she was at the centre of media attention for being Neena and West Indian cricketer Viv Richards’ child out of wedlock. She has been vocal about body image issues on social media, the discrimination she faced because of her skin colour and the scars it has left behind. In 2018, her divorce from producer Madhu Mantena once again brought her personal life under the spotlight. While her life seems to be far from the ordinary, Masaba insists that behind the high-walls and controversies, they are regular people, experiencing the same heartbreaks as us all. “Celebrities are made out to be larger-than-life figures, untouchable and intimidating and you can’t get a sense of what their lives would be like. But we are all normal human beings,” she says. The intent of making the show was to demonstrate how ordinary their lives are. Setting the story straight She goes on to observe, “You can’t control the narrative when you are somewhat of a public figure.” However, this project enabled her to finally tell her story the way she wanted to and “come clean about her life”. Even though the show has elements of fiction, it captures several milestones, anecdotal information, and character traits. “The part where I’m being sold my own prints, someone thinking I’m a country in Africa, mum posting on Instagram that she is looking for work and being asked to design clothes for a dog on a film set... It has all happened to us,” laughs Masaba. To make a series like this and reveal aspects of one’s life requires vulnerability, adds Neena, who was initially confused about the show’s intentions when her daughter approached her. “It sounded like a great idea, but I didn’t know what they wanted to do, was this a documentary on her life?” recalls the 61-year-old actor. But her primary concern was whether Masaba would manage to act, without any formal training. “It’s like my kid has just given an exam,” she grins. The desi Kardashians? This doting mother-daughter relationship is at the centre of the series. In the pilot episode, when a tabloid prints blind news of Masaba’s separation, Neena jumps into action to mollify her daughter. Would it be safe to say we have our own Indian Kardashians with the show? “Not at all,” says Masaba. “The Kardashians had a basic formula of putting a camera on their lives and following them day and night. Ours is a heavily scripted show and is a new genre.” She considers it to be closer to Curb Your Enthusiasm and Master of None . “I hope it wouldn’t be tied to something as common as Keeping up with the Kardashians — which I like — but our show is far deeper,” she says. Alongside Masaba’s struggles, the show chronicles the challenges faced by older women to find prominent roles in Hindi cinema, as Neena struggles to be cast as a lead actor. In real life, her role in Badhaai Ho renewed her otherwise flailing career. “I now get roles that are unbelievable. During the lockdown, I got three amazing roles. It is a golden period for actors, directors, and writers now with OTT and young filmmakers,” says Neena. Masaba too forayed into acting to cash in on this boom, which allowed her to play herself on-screen. “Playing yourself is both easy and hard,” she says. “There’s a fine line between being natural, which can be a bit dampening, and going over-the-top, which the audience can’t relate to.” She recalls, as a child, spending time on the sets of shows and films with her mother and observing how actors behave. She was inspired by her mother’s co-actor in the 1995 series, Gumraah , Irrfan Khan, who passed away this year. “I picked up from him that the greatness of an actor is how relaxed he or she is,” recalls Masaba. Being surrounded by women – director Sonam Nair, writers Punya Arora, Nandini Gupta, and Anupama Ramachandran – during the making of this show, brought in a sense of comfort for Masaba. “When we were writing, I don’t think we had to turn around and tell a male producer that this actually happens in our lives,” she recalls. “Had a man directed it, it would have been a different kind of a series,” adds Neena, as they both agree that the sensitivity with which women can tell women’s stories is indispensable. Masaba Masaba is now streaming on Netflix.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/im-being-sold-my-own-prints-someone-thinks-im-a-country-in-africa/article32470232.ece
29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||The new brew rules||Ashish D’abreo remembers when he and his business partners, Tej Thammaiah and Sreeram G, decided to ferment coffee last year. Their plan was to ferment the cascara — the skin of coffee berries — and then introduce it to the green beans that they store for natural fermentation. However, the brew didn’t meet their standards, leading them to try other combinations and techniques. These trials resulted in a range of three new blends, which will be launched over the course of the next two months, under their brand Maverick & Farmer (M&F) coffee roasters. These variants are aimed at third-wave drinkers who know an AeroPress from a Chemex. Ol’ Smoky is cold-smoked, while Orange You Curious features coffee that has been fermented in orange juice – during which time microorganisms consume the sugary pulp of the bean. The last micro-lot, named Milk & Honey, is made of lacto-fermented coffee. Each brew goes beyond the traditional roast profile. The orange blend, for example, has a distinct acidity that is more floral and fruity, with only a slight hint of citrus making its way to the final cup. Freshly fermented The trio behind M&F is not new to the business: D’abreo is a coffee roaster and barista, Thammaiah is a third-generation coffee farmer, and Sreeram has over 18 years’ experience in advertising, strategic business operations and brand design. Back in 2013, they founded The Flying Squirrel, one of India’s first artisanal coffees. Since divesting from the brand, they launched M&F in 2018. Currently, the Bengaluru-based brand has over 10 different blends and a line of brewing equipment. As before, the coffee is sourced from Thammaiah’s Ajjikutira plantation in Coorg, where special attention is paid to the terroir, soil and growing conditions. “Between 2013 and 2018, however, a number of people started something similar to The Flying Squirrel in terms of taste profiles and packaging,” says Sreeram. So M&F is now trying to “really push the envelope” through its experiments with fermentation. “The impetus is to do something completely maverick, trying to alter, create or unlock flavours,” says D’abreo. This is where fermentation comes in. It is quite the culinary fad — alongside the banana bread and sourdough wave during lockdown, many attempted to ferment kimchi, kombucha and more. But this team has been working on their techniques since the last harvest (in October 2019), using ingredients from the estate, such as oranges and wood chips from the fruit trees in Ajjikutira. Homebound experiments These innovations are coming to the market at a time when people are largely staying indoors and the roastery’s three outlets in New Delhi and Bengaluru aren’t the popular meeting spots they once were. Still, M&F has benefited from a rise in home brewers who are attempting to replicate artisanal coffee in their kitchens. “We’ve seen a 40% increase in orders for both coffee and equipment. It’s a very nice trend to see,” says Sreeram. While international brands like Hario and Bialetti are the gold standard, the Indian market is dominated by artisanal companies, and, at the moment, is fragmented in such a way that not one single brand is outselling the other. How do they plan to they set themselves apart and tie into this increased interest? Perhaps coffee subscriptions are in the pipeline? D’abreo says, “Yes, shortly,” as they are putting the tech in place. Customers will also get access to customised plans and help act as test groups for future experiments. “We’re also going to introduce Happy Boxes, where we can surprise our customers with something new,” he says. Perhaps next year, samples of the fermented cascara coffee will be available for a taste in our homes.  Ol’ Smoky is available at Rs. 499 for 200 gms. Orange You Curious and Milk and Honey will launch in September and October.

29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Just another meaningless number||With the government indicating that it might increase the minimum age of marriage for women from 18 to 21, we are again faced with a move that looks superficially “women-centric” but is actually born of a very incomplete understanding of women’s issues. The first myth to eliminate is that the move means gender parity simply because it equates the marriage ages for men and women. Given the extreme precarity of women’s positions in our patriarchal society, this facile ‘equality’ means nothing for real empowerment. Second, fiddling with legal age won’t fix the multitude of underlying issues that force women into early marriage. Families fear escalating dowries and social stigma. They fear for the safety of unmarried daughters. They fear inter-caste/ community love affairs. They fear having to keep feeding an extra mouth. Not one of these is addressed by changing 18 to 21. It only casts the net of criminality wider — drawing more distressed women and families into the downward spiral of cops and courtrooms. In a recent press conference organised by Partners for Law in Development (PLD), feminist lawyer Madhu Mehra pointed to how such laws often become a new source of harassment. She cited the case of a young woman in Karnataka who was denied a widow’s pension because she was below 18 when she married. This, in effect, is what the new law will do — push a new segment of hapless women into legal isolation and increased vulnerability. Third, the new law is being offered as a solution to improve maternal and infant mortality rates (MMR & IMR). This reasoning is incomplete and not backed by robust data. According to a 2019 report of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, the average age of women’s marriage in India is already 22.1 years. Yet, while falling within this average, Kerala’s MMR is 43 (national average 113) and IMR is 10 (33). Clearly, the reasons for Kerala’s far better health indices must be sought elsewhere — in how it has tackled poverty, female education, reproductive health, and awareness levels. Fourth, from the 70s onwards, a theory has been doing the rounds that raising the age of marriage will result in population control. This tacit aim remains alive, based on the entirely false premise that India’s population rate is galloping. It is not. The census shows that replacement fertility level is down to 2.2 compared to a global standard of 2.1. In fact, States like Bengal and Delhi are below 2. And this is true across religious communities. Targeting female fertility and controlling female sexuality is a classic patriarchal solution to problems created by patriarchy. Why do girls drop out of school at puberty? Who gets better nutrition in families? Can a poor, rural family ensure its daughter will be able to study or work safely if she stays single? Will a man demand lower dowry because his bride is 22 instead of 19? Will the number of ‘child brides’ magically drop just because their marriage age has been legally raised? Marriage is not why girls drop out of schools. Rather, enormous societal pressure forces them into early marriage. So let’s focus on what needs to be fixed first — accessible and flexible education, safe occupations and workplaces, vocational training and job creation, cash incentives to families whose daughters study up to Class 12 or undergraduate levels. Only these can delay marriage and improve women’s overall health and agency. Globally, 18 is considered adulthood. There is no need to infantilise Indian women. At best, this is a superficial response to a multi-layered problem whose real solution requires society to change. The latter is too hard to do, so we’re fussing with the former. We can’t abolish khap panchayats who carry out unspeakable atrocities to ‘discipline’ women. We can’t punish parents who file false rape charges if their adult daughter marries a man of her choice. We can’t ensure women safe, confidential access to sexual and reproductive healthcare. So we find a simplistic panacea. A new number that won’t solve anything but will only endanger the life and liberty of the poorest people with the least recourse to legal, social and financial safeguards, exposing them to further brutal policing. If the government really wants to help, it should forget legal tinkering and ensure legal enforcement and social transformation instead.

29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||How Poonachi became a children’s book||“It’s never too early to introduce your kids to Perumal Murugan, right?” Priya Kuriyan asks on Instagram. With its themes of social oppression and surveillance, the Tamil writer’s 2018 political novel, Poonachi, is for adults, yes, but the new picture book Kuriyan has illustrated works for all ages. The adaptation is of a portion of the novel, when Poonachi, a young, orphaned goat, wanders into a forest. “These were my favourite scenes in the original,” begins the Bengaluru-based illustrator and comic artist, admitting that it is “a miracle to bring out a book in these times”. Kuriyan, who is known for lacing her works and Instagram posts with social commentary, recalls that the idea for the picture book came from Murugan. “I was surprised myself, as the original is quite grim, especially the ending,” she says. Then Red Panda, an imprint of Westland Publications that launched in January this year, zeroed in on what could be used: “the perfect structure for a children’s book, with an interlude in a wondrous place”. Kuriyan borrowed the red and black colour scheme - and the whites of Poonachi’s eyes - from the cover of the original (also her design). Opting for digital art with linocut effect, her illustrations are vivid and refreshing. It’s no wonder that fans have begun requesting prints. “This is a great way to get children to read today,” admits the illustrator who has been very productive during the pandemic. Working on Poonachi saw her through the initial weeks of the lockdown, she says, but there are at least three other books to be released. In the last few months, she has done cover designs — M Mukundan’s Delhi: A Soliloquy , “about the lives of Malayali migrants in the capital during one of the most turbulent periods of our country’s history” is one — and editorial illustrations. But it is the glimpses of her sketchbook on Instagram that offers much-needed cheer. Like her take on the anxiety behind the nasopharyngeal swab test for Covid-19. Or when she employs mahogany seed pods to depict a protest of penguins or turns pumpkin seeds into a hound’s snarl. Kuriyan believes in subtle messaging through the characters she illustrates. “As artists for children, what you normalise is important. But never lose out on the fun. You can do a silly book and yet be political,” she says. With 55 books at last count (when she won the Big Little Book Award 2019 for the best children’s illustrator), this is sound advice indeed. Poonachi: Lost in the Forest by Westland Publications is priced at Rs. 249||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/how-poonachi-became-a-childrens-book/article32470255.ece
29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Parveen Babi through the 2020 lens||When film journalist Karishma Upadhyay was asked if she’d like to write the biography of Parveen Babi, she was intrigued. “I didn’t know much about her other than her work in Amar Akbar Anthony and Deewar, and her hit songs [like ‘Raat Baaqi Baat Baaqi’ and ‘Jawani Jan-E-Man’, both from Namak Halal ],” she says over the phone from Mumbai. She was immediately drawn in by the air of mystery around the glamorous Hindi movie star of the 1970s-80s, who sizzled on screen with a cool confidence and was just as charming off screen. Who was the woman behind the myths and gossip? It was Babi’s long struggle with mental illness that fascinated Upadhyay the most. In her debut book Parveen Babi: A Life, released last weekend, she traces the journey from Junagarh to Mumbai, via Ahmedabad and beyond to give readers a close-up version of the actress’ troubled life. Busting the ‘addict’ myth Upadhyay didn’t originally plan to write the book through the lens of Babi’s mental illness (diagnosed as schizophrenia). But once she started writing, she found clues to a quietly unravelling mind right from her student years in Ahmedabad. What were the myths she wanted to unpack? “The threads I heard very often was that she was a drug addict, a drinker and led a promiscuous life, that led to the mental illness. So that became my mission — to put across that she wasn’t a drug addict,” Upadhyay says. “She was a really good student, she enjoyed reading, writing and painting. It changed my perspective,” she adds. Weaving together episodes of psychotic outbursts (such as Babi threatening to jump out of a moving car and strip) and moments of incredible creative efficiency (such as her photographic memory and a great work ethic), Upadhyay draws up an engrossing portrait. In the book, she refers to a February 1974 interview by Stardust magazine: Parveen was happy to scotch rumours about being a divorcée and talk about everything from drug use (‘Yes, I’ve tried dope’) to pre-marital sex (‘All that talk about virgin brides is bull’) and her smoking habit. Perfect timing? The book mirrors raging debates on social media on mental health, stardom and outsiders in the industry following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. “Someone said to me that it shows that no matter how much the industry may have changed since her time, our understanding of mental illness remains abysmal, the stigma is just as bad. My only hope is that people walk away with some understanding that this can happen to anybody and mental illness does not look like what we see in Hindi films,” Upadhyay concludes. Parveen Babi: A Life ( Hachette India) is priced at Rs. 599 for the hardcover||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/parveen-babi-through-the-2020-lens/article32470251.ece
29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Counting 468 diamonds on this bridal mask||Over the past few months, masks have gone from simply being our first line of defence against Covid-19 to becoming an integral part of our outfits as a fashion statement. As with most trends, the innovation/personalisation has moved from design to the material used. In July, Pune-based businessman Shankar Kurhade was in the news for his 60-gram gold mask. An Israeli jewellery company is working on an 18K white gold mask to be decorated with 3,600 white and black diamonds. Closer home, Tara Sri - Tibarumal Gems & Jewels, the Hyderabad-based jeweller, has launched a bejewelled mask targeted at brides. The 18K yellow gold piece is embellished with 468 diamonds totalling up to 57 carats, took 440 man-hours to make and is backed with a custom-made triple-layer cotton mask. Weighing in at 175.5 grams, it is quite heavy to sport on the face — but if brides could wear a 30 kg Falguni and Shane Peacock lehenga without falling over, this should be a piece of cake. Gemmologist, jewellery designer and managing partner at Tara Sri, Anand Gupta, says, “The design was inspired by the lotus, and will not be replicated. We will work with brides to co-create each mask according to their outfits and themes.” At least a month’s notice is required to make a mask, he says, but time will vary depending on the design. Each customised creation will cost a cool Rs. 30 lakh. For that price, you could be the proud owner of a brand-new Ducati Panigale V4 S superbike or spend a night at the Sky Villa in Palms Casino Resort, Las Vegas. You could even buy a two bedroom flat on the outskirts of a metro city in India! However, Gupta assures us that the jewellery house is doing their bit for Covid-19 relief by donating 25% of the profit to organisations like Sri Shanti Ashram in Andhra Pradesh and others.

29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Now streaming: Korean, Turkish, Chinese||For those of us who grew up in the nineties and the early noughties, world cinema was Hollywood’s overly ‘arty’ cousin with subtitles. Then, when UTV World Movies launched a few years later in India, people couldn’t shut up about directors like François Truffaut and Vittorio De Sica. Back then, I’d wonder: Eurocentric cinema is fine, but what do people in Japan or China watch on TV? The streaming era ended that speculation. Over the last few years, major streaming networks like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have been investing heavily in content from Asia, and smaller players like Dish TV and MX Player are now following suit. Indian audiences have been reciprocating, going beyond the predictable languages (like French and Italian). The lockdown has accelerated this trend. With more time on hand, people are bingeing on South Korean, Turkish, Chinese and Thai dramas. Netflix’s 2017 Spanish original series, La Casa de Papel ( Money Heist in English), is the streaming service’s most-watched international series in a non-English language, while Korean one-season dramas such as Healer and Itaewon Class , Turkish soaps Aşk-ı Memnu and Kuzey Güney , and Chinese shows The Untamed and Ashes of Love are popular examples of international offerings. According to UK-based online market research firm YouGov’s 2019 report, 55% of Indians now watch foreign language content. ‘YouTube is the biggest platform for foreign content consumption’, it says. In fact, when Thai series Still 2Gether premiered on August 14, India ranked no 9 on producer GMMTV’s worldwide viewership list.  All things K  Hallyu (the Korean wave) isn’t new. For over a decade it has dominated playlists and vanity counters (K-pop, K-beauty — you name it, we’ve had it). In a 2019 interview with The Hindu , film editor Appu N Bhattathiri ( Drishyam ) highlighted how the International Film Festival of Kerala helped popularise Korean content. “K-dramas explore narratives that deal with the youth; I don’t think Indian television targets the youth like they do. Besides, access to Netflix, Amazon and so on has... created the urge to explore,” he says. Of late, social media, and forums on Reddit and Quora, are driving more people to K-drama. Mumbai-based influencer Scherezade ‘Sherry’ Shroff chanced upon this genre during lockdown, when she couldn’t find anything new and exciting to watch. “Normally I’m not someone who likes to watch shows with subtitles as you have to really focus. But after Crash Landing on You , I was sucked in,” she says. That a “whole world online is into K-drama” surprised her even more. When she shared her opinion on the show on social media — a ‘taboo’ romance between a South Korean fashion heiress and a North Korean secret police captain — she received an overwhelming barrage of requests for recommendations. “Nobody does romance like they [Koreans] do. It may not always be realistic, but when you are watching a romantic show you want that bit of escape,” says Shroff, who recommends It’s Okay to Not Be Okay (no 3 on Netflix a few weeks ago), Descendants of the Sun and Guardian .  Digital players  While Amazon Prime, a leading player in the category, opted not to comment on this viewing trend, Dish TV, which launched their streaming service/app Watcho last April, says they have noticed and acted on the rising popularity of Korean dramas in India. “Earlier this month, we added a new feature called ‘Korean Drama Active’ on Dish TV and d2h platforms. Users can now watch their favourite shows dubbed in Hindi,” says Sukhpreet Singh, Corporate Head, Marketing. For now, Dish TV has added 300+ hours of K-dramas. Down South, Chennai is a surprising market too. A couple of years ago, journalist-author Krupa Ge, in a newspaper article, noted how popular these shows were among young girls in Tamil Nadu. ‘...They are turning to K-dramas, watching them on streaming sites, exchanging downloaded versions…,’ she wrote, adding how the launch of Viu streaming, with a focus on Tamil and Korean content, ‘points to the fact that some have already begun to see a business model here’. Meanwhile, last November, Netflix signed a multi-year content production and distribution agreement with Korean entertainment company, CJ ENM, and its subsidiary, Studio Dragon. “This is an exciting time for not only Korean content, but content in any language to be successful anywhere. The language barrier is lowering and more audiences are discovering great stories made by the world,” a Netflix spokesperson told Mint recently, sharing that the platform was doubling down on its investment in such content.  Of culture and connections  But why are Korean — and more recently, Chinese, Thai and Japanese — shows so popular? “A show like Kingdom [Korean] has fantastical elements, like zombies. But the underlying emotional space occupied by Korean, or Japanese and Chinese characters for that matter, is something that resonates with Indians. We are all extremely emotional people!” says filmmaker Vishnuvardhan Kulasekaran, known for Kollywood films like Arrambam and Billa. He particularly enjoys Chinese content. “In the recent past, I’ve enjoyed shows like The Untamed , a fantasy drama [about two magic-wielders battling demonic forces, which made lead actors Xiao Zhan and Wang Yibo popular worldwide].” Other favourites include the German fiction series Dark and Israeli action thriller Fauda , which he finds addictive. “All of them have very different settings, but it’s the emotions and the characters that resonate with you,” he says. The characterisation is typically strong (the increased runtime, with 80-90-minute episodes, helps). These shows are also popular because of the underlying cultural similarities. “Grown-up kids still live with their parents, they [Asians] have the concept of arranged marriages, they don’t wear shoes in the house; there are so many overlaps,” says Shroff.  Subtitles for the win  Interestingly, Asian content is finding more unusual fans: an older generation. Chennai-based food writer Geeta Doctor blames her “new obsession with Turkish soaps on The Janissary Tree ” and wrote in The Hindu last month that “every evening I levitate on Turkish serials... and, depending on my mood, land in Istanbul or Cappadocia, the Anatolian region of central Turkey.” In Mumbai, Poorvi Bose got her parents into K-drama during the lockdown because “there was nothing to watch on TV and the news was really depressing”. “I started them off with Itaewon Class and my dad was totally into it. Now we watch these shows together,” says the 27-year-old, who recently wrote about her ‘K family’ for an online news portal. “The shows are tightly knit, with most having just one season. They also explore various genres — action, drama, fantasy — and themes like mental health. The fact that they don’t end with a cliffhanger makes them appealing too,” says Bose. Seven months ago at the Golden Globes, Korean director Bong Joon-ho (of Parasite fame) famously said, “Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films”. Well, the lockdown and Indian viewers with an appetite for more have proved him right. So break out those chopsticks and packet of ramen, and check in with grandma in Coimbatore or the uncle in Bareilly who are bingeing on ‘ phoren Asian’ shows.  — With inputs from   Surya Praphulla Kumar      andNidhi Adlakha       With subscriptions costing approximately Rs. 399 a month, Asian streaming platforms like Viki and Iqiyi — with original content such as Tower of Babel (Korean), My Strange Friend (Chinese) — are finding subscribers in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/now-streaming-korean-turkish-chinese/article32470288.ece

29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||The surge in senior living||COVID-19 may reshape the future of the senior living segment in India, with the demand for such homes set to rise amid the present uncertainties. There is only a limited supply in this segment, via 55 projects by the top 12 players — 60% in tier II cities and the remaining 40% in tier 1 cities. Prominent tier 2 cities include Coimbatore, Puducherry, Kodaikanal, Vadodara, Bhopal, Jaipur, Mysuru, Dehradun, Kanchipuram, among others. Key tier 1 cities are Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune, Noida, among others. Region-wise, the southern cities have a nearly 69% share of these projects, coinciding with the demographic assumption that elderly population growth in the Southern states will grow at a faster pace than the rest of India, according to a report by SBI. Banking in The United Nations Population Fund and Help Age India estimate that India’s aged population (>60 years) will touch 173 million by 2026. The pandemic is likely to accelerate demand for the segment as it has highlighted the elderly’s need for safety, care, well-being and companionship. As such, this asset class is a significant opportunity for developers and investors. Anuj Puri, Chairman, Anarock Property Consultants says, “Due to the rise of nuclear families, increased life expectancy and people living across geographies, ‘independent seniors’ are becoming a new demography. They do not settle for traditional old-age homes as they prefer — and can afford — autonomy, the company of aged peers in well-equipped retirement communities.” A recurring theme of this pandemic, he says, has been seniors living alone, struggling for basics, managing without house help and anxious about existing and potential medical issues. “The need for homes in a setting where these factors are taken care of is now undeniable.” Responding to the rebooted opportunity, Max India’s Antara Senior Living recently announced a Rs. 300 crore investment over the next 4-5 years, in senior living projects to come up in Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai. City-specific Senior living projects have sprung up mainly on the outskirts of major cities and in tier II and III cities across the country. Bhiwadi in NCR, Neral in Mumbai, Talegaon in Pune and Devanahalli in Bengaluru are some of the prominent locations around tier 1 cities, while tier II and III cities have more supply — a 60% share in approx. 33 projects. Tier 1 cities have just 22 projects dedicated to seniors. Among current projects, some are entirely for seniors (>55 years of age) while in others, only certain blocks/towers have dedicated senior-specific facilities. The latter option allows seniors to live in the same integrated township as their families, but among their age peers. Cost factors Top players operate on either of two models — outright sale or rentals (with security deposit and monthly charges). Average monthly rentals in senior living residences across cities start as low as Rs. 30,000 and go up to Rs. 1 lakh, depending on facilities, type of occupancy, etc. For outright sale, property prices vary depending on the city, facilities on offer, BHK-configuration, size etc. The maximum supply across cities is in the range of Rs. 20-Rs. 80 lakh, again depending on various factors. There are also some limited exclusive high-end senior living projects wherein units are priced between Rs. 2 and Rs. 8 crore. Policy framework To safeguard the rights of seniors, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has defined models for operating and monitoring retirement homes. While the framework is based on regulations for residential real estate, of which senior living is a part of, the norms acknowledge that these developments differ from conventional housing and have special requirements. The planning norms include permissible sizes of units, permitted Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and inclusion of such developments within the residential zones of the city’s masterplan. For instance, the average size of a 1BHK must be at least 40-60 sq. mt., and 50-80 sq. mt. for a 2BHK, in the plains. In hilly terrains, a 1BHK must be 30-35 sq. mt. and a 2BHK at 40-60 sq. mt. The physical standards must conform to the National Building Code Model and its bye-laws. With a regulatory body for managing and developing such assets already in place, increased developer activity, the institutionalisation of caregivers and specialised service providers are likely to be the next steps. Institutional capital will follow, as such assets are essentially income yielding .

29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Stamp duty cut to boost festive sales||With states like Maharashtra and Karnataka mulling a reduction in stamp duty and registration charges, the festive season — that began with Ganesh Chaturthi — may get a real shot in the arm. Both, a one-time waiver for first-time homebuyers and an outright cut in stamp duty charges could be festive season game-changers. Such measures are not new. In previous unprecedented times of extreme market stress — such as post-structural reforms like demonetisation, RERA etc. — some state governments gave concessions to boost their sluggish real estate markets. For instance, in FY 2017-18, the Haryana government slashed circle rates by 3-8% (which are usually revised upwards every year) to push housing sales while Maharashtra kept their ready reckoner rates unchanged, instead of revising them upward, the same year to push demand. Anuj Puri, Chairman, Anarock Property Consultants says, “ Apart from the obvious homebuyer benefits, the government can generate badly-needed revenue via increased registrations after the most severe downturn in recent history. Affordable and mid-segment properties, which are in maximum demand, would see the most traction from such a move,” he says, adding, “To ease inventory pile-up and cost overruns, many players have already topped off discounts with added incentives such as booking amount refunds, cashback schemes and easy payment structuring. A stamp duty rate cut could push sales into the green during the festive season.” Doing the math The stamp duty rate, payable on the sale agreement, is fixed by the respective state governments and therefore varies: lStamp duty charges in Karnataka are 5% for properties costing more than Rs. 35 lakh, 3% for properties priced between Rs. 21 lakh and Rs. 35 lakh and 2% for properties up to Rs. 20 lakh. lA lower stamp duty charge for affordable properties was announced in the last state budget and the government is being asked to extend the lower charges to properties above Rs. 35 lakh as well. lIn Maharashtra, stamp duty charges are 5% in key cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Nashik, and 6% in others. A 2-3% reduction in rates will result in significant savings for homebuyers. lStamp duty rates in other major states largely hover anywhere between 5-8%, but they are lower in some states if property registration is executed in the name of a woman. Delhi, UP, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana offer relaxation in stamp duty for women buyers. The exemption on stamp duty ranges from 1-2% in different states: Potential savings A property measuring 500 sq. ft. in a locality in Mumbai can cost as much Rs. 14,100/sq. ft. as a basic price. Parking charges can run up to Rs. 2.80 lakh, and floor rise charge to Rs. 45/sq. ft. (for a property on the 7th floor, the floor rise premium will be Rs. 315 per sq. ft. (45*7=315). The total base price will thus be Rs. 14,415/sq. ft. lSaleable value = 500 * 14,415 = Rs. 72,07,500 (basic cost) + 2,80,000 (parking charges) = Rs. 74,87,500 /- lRegistration Charges = 1% of Rs. 74,87,500 = Rs. 74,875 /- lStamp duty = 5% of Rs. 74,87,500 = Rs. 3,74,375 /- Total cost of the property = Rs. 79,36,750/-  To conclude If stamp duty charges are reduced by 2% to a new rate of 3%, a buyer immediately saves Rs. 1,49,750 /-. With a 3% reduction, the saving is nearly Rs. 2,24,625 /-. Such amounts matter in affordable and mid-segment properties. Given that the residential industry revival will necessarily be a collaborative effort involving all stakeholders, there is anticipation that the government will provide this important nudge to what is traditionally the period of maximum traction for the housing sector.

29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Spruce up the home office||The pandemic has made working from home the norm, for the near future at least. However, it isn’t easy to get used to with the many distractions that pop up throughout the day. With working smarter being the new mantra, it’s imperative to ensure that you work at a desk that maximises your productivity. After all, you’re there nine hours a day, 45 hours a week so shouldn’t you get more done faster? Place the desk right If your desk doesn’t get ample light, it’s sure to hamper your productivity potential. Try setting your desk by a window; if not possible, get a lamp. Declutter and organise A messy desk may be symbolic of a creative bent of mind but there’s nothing like organisation if you want to get things done. Declutter and purge regularly to ensure that the desk gives you space for what it’s meant to — work. Get a potted plant Research done at University of Exeter in 2013 found that the presence of plants at the workplace aids concentration, boosts productivity and enhances staff well-being by 47%. Get one today. Make it happy According to Miguel McKelvey, co-founder and CEO of WeWork, which transforms offices into productive workspaces, happiness “really is the foundation of productivity”. So add happiness with personal items such as favourite photos, quotes and mementoes. Heavy items to the left Kayla Matthews, a Pittsburgh-based productivity blogger, suggests a simple productivity trick — placing larger and heavier items, such as the computer and books, on the left side and smaller items, in descending order, on the right. The mind — trained to look from left to right — registers the important things first. Work standing up at times Continued research shows that standing can make you healthier. But a study conducted by Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Public Health on call center workers showed that working standing up can increase productivity by 46%. Apart from getting the desk right, we suggest you follow these basic rules to ensure you work well every single day:   Get priorities in order:  The most productive people know that the secret to getting more done in a workday is to begin the day with a to-do list and end it by putting together the to-do list for the next day.   Eat the frog first:  The 80-20 rule applies to productivity as well with 80% of your accomplishments coming from 20% of your efforts. So figure out what comprises this 20% and focus most of your time and energy — especially when you’re fresh — on that .   Work in time blocks:  It’s not easy to be productive when there’s so much that needs your attention. So time block towards specific activities; setting aside a half-hour block for a task without any phone calls, social media distractions or chit-chat will help you get there faster.   Sift & sort through the day:  Maintain a productive spirit and environment by remembering the 3 T’s: Tuck, transfer or trash. Whether it’s an email or note, file as “pending” if important, delegate if you need to immediately or trash if completely irrelevant.     Schedule time for calls:  There’s absolutely no need for answering phone calls as soon as you receive them or replying to emails within the hour. Allocate a half hour in the late afternoon as phone time — it’s possible to get everything done!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/spruce-up-the-home-office/article32470301.ece
29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Report on construction waste||According to the Building Material Promotion Council (BMTPC), India generates an estimated 150 million tonnes of construction and demolition (C&D) waste every year. But the official recycling capacity is a meagre 6,500 tonnes per day (TPD) — just about 1%. What’s more, unofficial estimates of the total waste generated in the country put the figure at three-five times more than the official estimate. A recently-released analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has laid bare some of these unpleasant truths about the way the country is managing its C&D waste. Another Brick off the Wall: Improving construction and demolition waste management in Indian cities — as the analysis report is titled — also goes on to recommend a viable plan of action. Releasing the report, CSE director general Sunita Narain said, “Our study shows that as many as 53 cities were expected to set up recycling facilities to recover material from C&D waste by 2017 — but only 13 cities have done that by 2020. This is unacceptable when the demand for primary building material, including minerals, stone, sand, iron ore, aluminium, and timber, is growing at an unprecedented rate.” Narain also highlighted how a significant proportion of construction waste can be recycled, reused and brought back to construction to substitute naturally sourced material. “This demands a circular economy that can turn C&D waste into a resource. This can help reduce energy intensity and environmental footprints of buildings and infrastructure.” CSE researchers point out that the sorry state of affairs exists notwithstanding the removal of legal hurdles to using recycled C&D material in construction. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has allowed the use of concrete made from recycled material and processed C&D waste. The Construction and Demolition Waste Rules and Regulations, 2016 have mandated reuse of recycled material. Even the Swachh Bharat Mission has recognised the need for C&D waste management. Ranking points for C&D waste management for Swachh Survekshan 2021 have been doubled to 100 points, divided equally between management infrastructure and waste processing efficiency. Cities will need to have a C&D waste collection system in place; notified charges for C&D services; and segregation of waste in five streams. Under waste processing efficiency criteria, ranking points will be awarded based on the percentage of collected waste that is processed and reused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/report-on-construction-waste/article32470297.ece
29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Open letter to namma Kamala||Our dear Kamala, As you know it’s been a week of mixed fortunes for us. On one hand, while Chennai was declared third most asingam [dirty] city in India, you, dear girl, have been selected to be Joe Biden’s running mate. It is a huge victory for all of us Madras- vasis and an even bigger one for us elite Besant Nagar nivasis (even though, personally, I’m not in favour of the word ‘mate’ or that it is preceded by the word ‘running’). Just the other day, as I was reading Tangy Tart Hot & Sweet (not an autobiography, I caution readers), I realised that its author, Padma Lakshmi, is a Besant Nagar ponnu [girl], too. While she is ruling the culinary world dressed in fetching gear, with her recipes of curd rice with manga thokku [mango pieces], you, precious child, will be ruling, well, the world. What a double coincidence that your names, Padma and Kamala, both mean lotus. You can’t imagine how proud that makes us feel. First things first. What are you going to do for us ? That’s how you should see the post of Vice President of the United States. I have a few ideas. Your hometown’s reputation, as you know, has taken a blow. Please direct NASA to shoot some purifying lasers every day at us to vaporise the morning asingam along our beautiful coastline. It is all that rampant Number One and Number Two which has put our city at Number Three. Secondly, and this is important, could you reduce the onslaught of classical danseuses who arrive in droves here every December? It is becoming difficult for us, dear. The arangetram upon arangetram of hapless U.S.-born Indian children at various sabhas has taken a serious toll on our collective health. Tell the Bay Area Akkas to slow down, no? Would be eternally grateful if you could put an embargo of some sort. Now that we have got what you can do for us in your janmabhoomi out of the way, let us come to the equally important matter of what you can do for us in your karmabhoomi . As prescribed by the Vedas , all Besant Nagar residents have a minimum of one sibling in America. And despite our best efforts, we have to visit during kolus , graduations and proms from time to time. Whenever I visit my brother-in-law, and he takes us to the neighbourhood temple or the microbrewery depending on what day of the week it is, I find it hard to be neatly attired. It is impossible to have properly ironed clothes in the U.S. My suggestion is that you give Marimuthu, our local istriwallah , a visa on a war footing. The gated community in Seattle I frequent sure could do with one. It will be only a matter of time before Marimuthu, resourceful fellow that he is, sets up istri vandis all across the U.S. with his many cousins who run a sort of an istri mafia in Besant Nagar, and ensures that Americans finally have pants that have a respectable crease. Similarly, I think the U.S. needs potti kadais , too. Whenever I go on my evening stroll, I kind of miss my ritual of lighting up a Gold Flake Kings, sucking on a kadalai muttai , and greeting everyone who passes by with a cheery ‘Wassup, thambi ’. Next step, autorickshaws, and Kamala ponnu , you chaps can call yourselves a truly developed nation. Also, if possible, alter spelling to Harish. Trust me, you’ll defeat Biden and become President. Then nobody can stop us. With blessings, Kittu Chittappa Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/open-letter-to-namma-kamala/article32470582.ece
29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||‘I’m being sold my own prints, someone thinks I’m a country in Africa’||At the crack of dawn, a distraught Masaba Gupta, dressed in a bright scarlet gown, walks down an empty Mumbai street to her mother’s home. She has just announced her separation with her husband on Instagram after a short-lived marriage. This opening shot of her semi-autobiographical series, Masaba Masaba , aptly sums up her relationship with her mother, Neena Gupta, who raised her single-handedly. When life throws her a curveball, the 31-year-old fashion designer and entrepreneur runs to her mother for comfort. Growing up, she was at the centre of media attention for being Neena and West Indian cricketer Viv Richards’ child out of wedlock. She has been vocal about body image issues on social media, the discrimination she faced because of her skin colour and the scars it has left behind. In 2018, her divorce from producer Madhu Mantena once again brought her personal life under the spotlight. While her life seems to be far from the ordinary, Masaba insists that behind the high-walls and controversies, they are regular people, experiencing the same heartbreaks as us all. “Celebrities are made out to be larger-than-life figures, untouchable and intimidating and you can’t get a sense of what their lives would be like. But we are all normal human beings,” she says. The intent of making the show was to demonstrate how ordinary their lives are. Setting the story straight She goes on to observe, “You can’t control the narrative when you are somewhat of a public figure.” However, this project enabled her to finally tell her story the way she wanted to and “come clean about her life”. Even though the show has elements of fiction, it captures several milestones, anecdotal information, and character traits. “The part where I’m being sold my own prints, someone thinking I’m a country in Africa, mum posting on Instagram that she is looking for work and being asked to design clothes for a dog on a film set... It has all happened to us,” laughs Masaba. To make a series like this and reveal aspects of one’s life requires vulnerability, adds Neena, who was initially confused about the show’s intentions when her daughter approached her. “It sounded like a great idea, but I didn’t know what they wanted to do, was this a documentary on her life?” recalls the 61-year-old actor. But her primary concern was whether Masaba would manage to act, without any formal training. “It’s like my kid has just given an exam,” she grins. The desi Kardashians? This doting mother-daughter relationship is at the centre of the series. In the pilot episode, when a tabloid prints blind news of Masaba’s separation, Neena jumps into action to mollify her daughter. Would it be safe to say we have our own Indian Kardashians with the show? “Not at all,” says Masaba. “The Kardashians had a basic formula of putting a camera on their lives and following them day and night. Ours is a heavily scripted show and is a new genre.” She considers it to be closer to Curb Your Enthusiasm and Master of None . “I hope it wouldn’t be tied to something as common as Keeping up with the Kardashians — which I like — but our show is far deeper,” she says. Alongside Masaba’s struggles, the show chronicles the challenges faced by older women to find prominent roles in Hindi cinema, as Neena struggles to be cast as a lead actor. In real life, her role in Badhaai Ho renewed her otherwise flailing career. “I now get roles that are unbelievable. During the lockdown, I got three amazing roles. It is a golden period for actors, directors, and writers now with OTT and young filmmakers,” says Neena. Masaba too forayed into acting to cash in on this boom, which allowed her to play herself on-screen. “Playing yourself is both easy and hard,” she says. “There’s a fine line between being natural, which can be a bit dampening, and going over-the-top, which the audience can’t relate to.” She recalls, as a child, spending time on the sets of shows and films with her mother and observing how actors behave. She was inspired by her mother’s co-actor in the 1995 series, Gumraah , Irrfan Khan, who passed away this year. “I picked up from him that the greatness of an actor is how relaxed he or she is,” recalls Masaba. Being surrounded by women – director Sonam Nair, writers Punya Arora, Nandini Gupta, and Anupama Ramachandran – during the making of this show, brought in a sense of comfort for Masaba. “When we were writing, I don’t think we had to turn around and tell a male producer that this actually happens in our lives,” she recalls. “Had a man directed it, it would have been a different kind of a series,” adds Neena, as they both agree that the sensitivity with which women can tell women’s stories is indispensable. Masaba Masaba is now streaming on Netflix.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/im-being-sold-my-own-prints-someone-thinks-im-a-country-in-africa/article32470604.ece
29 August 2020||CHANDIGARH,||Punjab House passes resolution against Centre’s agri ordinances||Adhering to protocols in place amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Punjab Assembly on Friday passed a resolution rejecting the Centre’s recent farm ordinances and the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill . The truncated session of the House also passed seven Bills during a specially convened one-day session here. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, while tabling the resolution, said the Assembly was concerned about the apprehensions and anguished caused by the three ordinances and the electricity Bill among the people of Punjab, particularly the farmers and landless workers, as these were not only against their interest, but were also against the Constitution of India. “Entry 14 of List II of the Constitution comprises agriculture as the subject of the States, therefore these ordinances are a direct encroachment upon the functions of the States and against the spirit of cooperative federalism enshrined in the Constitution and will promote distress sale,” Capt. Amarinder said. He said “this House thus urges upon the Union government to withdraw these ordinances and the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020, forthwith; and instead, promulgate a fresh ordinance making the procurement of foodgrains and other agricultural produce at the Minimum Support Price.” The Chief Minister said that the ordinances were anti-Punjab and anti-farmer and would drag the State into the chaos-filled era of the 1980s, which it can ill afford as Pakistan was waiting in the wings to derive advantage from the chaotic situation to create mayhem in the country.  Akali Dal MLAs absent While the Shiromani Akali Dal MLAs were not present in the House, BJP MLA Dinesh Singh was against the resolution and supported the ordinances, saying that it was nowhere mentioned in the ordinances that the MSP regime would be done away with. Aam Aadmi Party MLAs and Lok Insaf Party MLA Simarjit Singh Bains supported the resolution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/punjab-house-passes-resolution-against-centres-agri-ordinances/article32470623.ece
29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||How Poonachi became a children’s book||“It’s never too early to introduce your kids to Perumal Murugan, right?” Priya Kuriyan asks on Instagram. With its themes of social oppression and surveillance, the Tamil writer’s 2018 political novel, Poonachi, is for adults, yes, but the new picture book Kuriyan has illustrated works for all ages. The adaptation is of a portion of the novel, when Poonachi, a young, orphaned goat, wanders into a forest. “These were my favourite scenes in the original,” begins the Bengaluru-based illustrator and comic artist, admitting that it is “a miracle to bring out a book in these times”. Kuriyan, who is known for lacing her works and Instagram posts with social commentary, recalls that the idea for the picture book came from Murugan. “I was surprised myself, as the original is quite grim, especially the ending,” she says. Then Red Panda, an imprint of Westland Publications that launched in January this year, zeroed in on what could be used: “the perfect structure for a children’s book, with an interlude in a wondrous place”. Kuriyan borrowed the red and black colour scheme - and the whites of Poonachi’s eyes - from the cover of the original (also her design). Opting for digital art with linocut effect, her illustrations are vivid and refreshing. It’s no wonder that fans have begun requesting prints. “This is a great way to get children to read today,” admits the illustrator who has been very productive during the pandemic. Working on Poonachi saw her through the initial weeks of the lockdown, she says, but there are at least three other books to be released. In the last few months, she has done cover designs — M. Mukundan’s Delhi: A Soliloquy , “about the lives of Malayali migrants in the capital during one of the most turbulent periods of our country’s history” is one — and editorial illustrations. But it is the glimpses of her sketchbook on Instagram that offers much-needed cheer. Like her take on the anxiety behind the nasopharyngeal swab test for Covid-19. Or when she employs mahogany seed pods to depict a protest of penguins or turns pumpkin seeds into a hound’s snarl. Kuriyan believes in subtle messaging through the characters she illustrates. “As artists for children, what you normalise is important. But never lose out on the fun. You can do a silly book and yet be political,” she says. With 55 books at last count (when she won the Big Little Book Award 2019 for the best children’s illustrator), this is sound advice indeed. Poonachi: Lost in the Forest by Westland Publications is priced at Rs. 249||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/how-poonachi-became-a-childrens-book/article32470584.ece
29 August 2020||New Delhi,||Officials sought Centre’s ‘guidance’ to hike tests despite CM’s decision||Despite Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s announcement to double COVID-19 testing in Delhi, Principal Secretary of Health and Family Welfare (H&FW) Department of the Delhi government wrote in a note to seek “guidance” from an expert committee and Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on “whether scaling up of testing is to be done”, according to official documents. “Further guidance may be kindly sought from the expert committee/MHA on the following aspects — in light of the current COVID-19 situation and trajectory of cases in Delhi whether scaling up of testing is to be done and if so, to what extent,” a note written by the Principal Secretary (H&FW) Vikram Dev Dutt on Wednesday read. The decision to increase testing had become controversial with the Delhi government on Thursday alleging that the MHA was putting pressure on Delhi government officials to not increase the number of tests in the city, a claim which was rubbished by the MHA, which termed it “false and baseless”. “Submitted for kind information and further orders. The above has been communicated separately to MHA and Dr. V.K. Paul, member of NITI Aayog,” the note further read. In Delhi, the services department, which appoints Delhi government officials, is not under the State government but is under the ambit of Lt. Governor, who is appointed by the Central government. In the past also, the Delhi government has locked horns with the Central government over officials and the Centre’s involvement in decisions of the State government. Uptick in cases As Delhi has been witnessing an uptick in the COVID-19 cases, the Chief Minister on Wednesday had announced that the number of daily tests to detect the virus will be doubled from 20,000 to 40,000 in a week. On Friday, addressing reporters, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain commented on the issue: “CM did a meeting three days ago and said that testing should be doubled. But from the [Union] Home Ministry, pressure was put on officers to not do the [increased] testing. Permission was sought from here to the Home Ministry whether to [increase] tests or not. If increase, then how much.” On Thursday, in a letter written in Hindi to Secretary of MHA, Mr. Jain had said, “Some [Delhi government] officials have said Home Ministry [Centrel] is putting pressure on Delhi government officials to not increase testing.” Responding to the allegation, the MHA had said: “The allegation raised in the letter of the Delhi Health Minister dated August 27, 2020, which is addressed to Union Home Secretary, to the effect that MHA is putting pressure on Delhi government officers not to increase testing in Delhi is false and baseless.” Mr. Dutt did not respond to multiple calls and messages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/officials-sought-centres-guidance-to-hike-tests-despite-cms-decision/article32470578.ece
29 August 2020||GURUGRAM,||Malls, shops in Haryana to remain shut on Mondays and Tuesdays||Sudden spike has been registered in the number of COVID-19 cases in the Millennium City this week, mostly due to holding of social and family gatherings, said Gurugram Chief Medical Officer, Virender Yadav on Friday. In a related development, the shopping malls and shops, except those dealing in essential services, will remain shut on Mondays and Tuesdays in the State instead of over the weekend. Mr. Yadav, addressing a weekly press conference, said that 793 cases of COVID-19 were recorded this week compared with 620 the previous week, indicating a rise in rate of infection. He added that the infection cases are now doubled every 80 days compared to 90-odd earlier. He attributed the rise in COVID-19 cases to social and family gatherings, saying that people from the same family or locality were found infected. Supporting his assertion, Mr. Yadav said that seventeen people were found infected in a house in Jacobpura and ten National Security Guard commandos had also tested positive. The officer informed that the positivity rate was 6.77% and the mortality rate was 1.15% for the district. A total of 1,58,528 people have been tested so far and the number of tests conducted per million is 1,11,310. In August, 54,694 tests have been conducted, including 29, 691 antigen tests. The rate of infection for antigen tests is 2%, but it is around 6% for RT-PCR test. Camps for testing Mr. Yadav said around 100 camps would be held to conduct tests. He made an appeal to the shopkeepers, especially those in Sadar Bazar, to come forward for the tests. Mr. Yadav said there were no cases reported in industrial sector and factories. Meanwhile, State Disaster Management Authority reconsidered its earlier order to shut down shopping malls and shops, except those dealing in essential goods and services, over the weekend and fixed it for Mondays and Tuesdays. The liquor vends, however, will stay out of the purview of the order and remain open. Huge relief The government’s decision to shut commercial establishments on the weekend had met strong opposition from the business community saying that it would ruin their business. Lalit Rawat, manager, Metropolis Shopping Mall, welcomed the decision saying it was a huge relief for the shopkeepers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/malls-shops-in-haryana-to-remain-shut-on-mondays-and-tuesdays/article32470630.ece
29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Parveen Babi through the 2020 lens||When film journalist Karishma Upadhyay was asked if she’d like to write the biography of Parveen Babi, she was intrigued. “I didn’t know much about her other than her work in Amar Akbar Anthony and Deewar, and her hit songs [like ‘Raat Baaqi Baat Baaqi’ and ‘Jawani Jan-E-Man’, both from Namak Halal ],” she says over the phone from Mumbai. She was immediately drawn in by the air of mystery around the glamorous Hindi movie star of the 1970s-80s, who sizzled on screen with a cool confidence and was just as charming off screen. Who was the woman behind the myths and gossip? It was Babi’s long struggle with mental illness that fascinated Upadhyay the most. In her debut book Parveen Babi: A Life, released last weekend, she traces the journey from Junagarh to Mumbai, via Ahmedabad and beyond to give readers a close-up version of the actress’ troubled life. Busting the ‘addict’ myth Upadhyay didn’t originally plan to write the book through the lens of Babi’s mental illness (diagnosed as schizophrenia). But once she started writing, she found clues to a quietly unravelling mind right from her student years in Ahmedabad. What were the myths she wanted to unpack? “The threads I heard very often was that she was a drug addict, a drinker and led a promiscuous life, that led to the mental illness. So that became my mission — to put across that she wasn’t a drug addict,” Upadhyay says. “She was a really good student, she enjoyed reading, writing and painting. It changed my perspective,” she adds. Weaving together episodes of psychotic outbursts (such as Babi threatening to jump out of a moving car and strip) and moments of incredible creative efficiency (such as her photographic memory and a great work ethic), Upadhyay draws up an engrossing portrait. In the book, she refers to a February 1974 interview by Stardust magazine: Parveen was happy to scotch rumours about being a divorcée and talk about everything from drug use (‘Yes, I’ve tried dope’) to pre-marital sex (‘All that talk about virgin brides is bull’) and her smoking habit. Perfect timing? The book mirrors raging debates on social media on mental health, stardom and outsiders in the industry following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. “Someone said to me that it shows that no matter how much the industry may have changed since her time, our understanding of mental illness remains abysmal, the stigma is just as bad. My only hope is that people walk away with some understanding that this can happen to anybody and mental illness does not look like what we see in Hindi films,” Upadhyay concludes. Parveen Babi: A Life ( Hachette India) is priced at Rs. 599 for the hardcover||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/parveen-babi-through-the-2020-lens/article32470583.ece
29 August 2020||New Delhi,||‘Reaction was proportionate to gravity of threat in Jamia’||The police on Friday defended before the Delhi High Court its decision to enter the Jamia Millia Islamia during the violence that occurred in December last year, saying it was done to control the “aggravated form of unlawful assembly”. Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi, appearing for Delhi Police, said: “The nature of the gathering was a criminal mob... they were free of all inhibitions. They moved with the force to commit any crime. Proportionate to the gravity of the threat, there was a reaction from police”. ‘Repeated pleas to crowd’ Mr. Lekhi said the police’s reaction was “preceded by repeated pleas to the crowd to exercise restraint and go back, and after informing the crowd that they are part of an unlawful assembly”. This request was made by a Joint Commissioner of Police, a senior officer in the force, Mr. Lekhi said, adding that “he too was attacked”. The ASG said despite multiple warnings, the mob continued to march and instead of retreating, took a parallel road to reach Mathura Road. “A demand for more force was made in view of the large mob,” he said. “The violent mob armed with stick, stones, bricks, started targeting public vehicles and properties...The police finding no other way to control the mob, at the end used tear gas and moderate force,” he said. The ASG said when the mob was pushed back, they “strategically entered the Jamia campus and used it as cover started pelting stones at the police” for one and half hours. Hence there was “good cause” for the police to enter the Jamia campus to contain the violence, ASG Lekhi said. Next hearing A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan have adjourned the hearing for September 18. The court was hearing a batch of petitions, moved by lawyers, students of JMI, residents of Okhla in south Delhi, seeking setting up of a judicial commission to look into the Jamia violence and registration of FIRs against the erring police officers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/reaction-was-proportionate-to-gravity-of-threat-in-jamia/article32470628.ece
29 August 2020||Guwahati,||MNF sweeps local body polls||The Mizo National Front (MNF) swept the Aizawl Municipal Council polls on Friday, winning 50 of the 59 local bodies where elections were held on Thursday. The Congress, which had won most of the local councils five years ago, only managed four this time, while the principal Opposition party Zoram People’s Movement (ZPM) got just one. Independents won the four remaining councils where elections were held. Officials of the State Election Council (SEC), Mizoram, said the outcome of the polls for the 558 village councils was being awaited. They said 60.34% of a total of 1,50,687 voters — excluding those in the containment zones — had cast their votes compared to 68.35% in 2015.  Protests ignored Unlike Assam and Arunachal Pradesh where a tribal council and panchayat elections respectively were deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Mizoram government decided to go ahead with the polls despite protests from the Congress and other political parties. “There are 83 councils in [State capital] Aizawl, but elections were held in 59 councils, as 24 local councils had been declared containment zones following some cases of infection. Elections were held in a total of 381 seats in these 59 councils, 279 of which were general and 102 reserved,” a senior SEC officer said. The MNF, which had won 27 of the 40 Assembly seats in 2018 to end the Congress’s 10-year rule, bagged 262 local council seats. The Congress won 84 seats and the ZPM 23.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/mnf-sweeps-local-body-polls/article32470624.ece

Besides, show-cause notices have been served to four firms, including the concessionaire for the project. The action came after the NHAI, prima facie, found evidence of lapses on the part of vendors resulting in the collapse of a portion of the corridor. Around 40-m-long span between two piers of the 4.75-km-long under-construction elevated corridor on NH-248A had collapsed on August 22. The corridor is part of the six-laning and strengthening of 22-km-long stretch of the highway starting from Rajiv Chowk. NHAI notices Besides a show-cause notice to M/s Rajiv Chowk – Sohna Highway Pvt. Ltd. for deficiencies in the construction work, the NHAI has served similar notice to another firm for lapses in discharging the duties of the Independent Engineer. Two more firms have been served notices for lapses in preparation and review of design and drawings of the construction works. A four-member committee of technical experts has been constituted to examine lapses and suggest remedial measures. NHAI Chairman Sukhbir Singh Sandhu said: “The NHAI is committed to follow the highest standards in highway construction and any lapses in these will be dealt with zero tolerance. Strict action will be taken against the defaulters and they will be debarred from NHAI projects for a long period with severe penalties.” Earlier this week, the work for the widening and strengthening of the highway was suspended and a fine of Rs. 50,000 per day was imposed on each of the two concessionaires till the time safety measures were put in place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/senior-expert-bridge-engineer-debarred-from-nhai-projects/article32470568.ece

29 August 2020||New Delhi,||HC declines Choksi’s plea seeking pre-screening of documentary||The Delhi High Court on Friday declined a plea of fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi, an accused in the Rs. 13,500-crore Punjab National Bank scam, seeking to be given a pre-screening of Netflix documentary ‘ Bad Boy Billionaires ’. The High Court said a writ petition for enforcement of a private right cannot be maintainable. It said Mr. Choksi’s remedy lies in a civil suit. As per Netflix website, ‘ Bad Boy Billionaires: India ’ is an “investigative docu-series” that explores the “greed, fraud and corruption that built up — and ultimately brought down — India’s most infamous tycoons”. The show’s poster carries the pictures of Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, Subrata Roy and Byrraju Ramalinga Raju. During the hearing, Netflix’s counsel opposed Mr. Choksi’s plea for the pre-screening. It also questioned the maintainability of the plea. Mr. Choksi, an accused in the PNB scam, had left the country last year and was granted citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda. In his plea, he also sought for postponement of the release of the said documentary, slated to be released on September 2 on Netflix. Mr. Choksi said he became aware of the documentary’s imminent release when he saw the trailer and started receiving phone calls from various persons across the world, including from Delhi, asking him if he was a part of it. The plea stated that he discovered that one of the persons seen speaking in the trailer was Pavan C. Lall, who had written a book titled ‘ Flawed: The Rise and Fall of India’s Diamond Mogul Nirav Modi ’ where his name had been commingled with Nirav Modi’s, another fugitive Indian businessman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-declines-choksis-plea-seeking-pre-screening-of-documentary/article32470567.ece
29 August 2020||New Delhi,||Over 1,800 new cases in city again||Delhi reported 1,808 new COVID-19 cases in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 1,69,412, according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Friday. Also, 20 more deaths have been reported, taking the total number of deaths to 4,389. Of the total cases, 1,51,473 people have recovered and there are 13,550 active cases in the city at present. The number of active cases, positive people under home isolation, and positive people in hospitals have also shown an increase on Friday. Though the Chief Minister had on Wednesday announced that the number of COVID-19 tests would be doubled to 40,000 a day, the District Magistrate said that they were yet to get any orders on how to increase testing. “There are about 300 dispensaries for such tests and if each of them conducts 100 tests and the hospitals do around 200 tests each, then it will be a substantial number,” Health Minister Satyendar Jain said on Friday. He said that the government will soon start a campaign to encourage people to undergo tests. The Minister also urged people to wear masks and maintain social distance as cases have been rising in the city. Meanwhile, only 22,933 tests were done in the city in the past 24 hours, the bulletin stated. When asked about the increase in the number of cases in the city, Mr. Jain said, “It could go up to 2,400 to 2,600 a day, but we will trace all the contacts and test and isolate them. The number of cases is likely to decrease when the government increase testing and tracing.” When asked if with 29.1% people developing antibodies against the virus, there are chances of Delhi facing a second wave of the infection, the Minister said, “The first wave has not ended in Delhi. The current increase is not a second wave. Nationally, there is a new peak every day, but Delhi is not even reporting half the peak number of cases now.” After the number of daily new cases in the city on June 23 touched almost 4,000 – the highest so far – it had been dropping. However, earlier this week, the number of daily new cases hit a 30-day high and then breached the 1,500 mark, after remaining below the level for 39 consecutive days. The number of active cases in the city on Friday was the highest in over a month. The last time the number of active cases was more than this was on July 24 when it was 13,681. The active cases, which were 27,007 on July 1, had fallen to 9,897 on August 4, but since then it has remained above that mark. The number of containment zones in the city as on Friday was 763, which has been showing a steady increase over the past week. Mr. Jain also said that the government will start a campaign against dengue from next month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/over-1800-new-cases-in-city-again/article32470576.ece
29 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Hotel revenues in Capital drop 44% during Jan.-July||Hit hard by the outbreak of pandemic, the Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) in Delhi has declined by 44.3% during the January-July 2020 period as compared to the same period in the previous year, according to JLL India Hotels and Hospitality Group. While noting that this decline is modest as compared to major cities in India, it added that the city’s RevPAR is slowly rising as the Central and State governments have gradually eased the lockdown restrictions, combined with international repatriation flights and some domestic travel helping recovery. “Delhi’s hotel demand is driven by corporate business travel, government and judiciary linked travel and leisure segment travel. Out of these, government, judiciary and administration linked travel will likely come back sooner followed by business-critical travel,” Jaideep Dang, Managing Director, Hotels & Hospitality Group (India), JLL, said. The company added that hotels are now receiving several inquiries for weddings and social events with limited gatherings, within the allowed limit of 50 people per function.

While women were conspicuous in their absence from it, two former district in-charges were given another chance. Party insiders said those chosen were seized upon on the basis of feedback and surveys involving grassroots workers as well as citizen feedback. Ram Kishore Sharma from Shahdara and Rohtash Bidhuri from South Delhi have been given a second tenure. The announcement came in the wake of a significant meeting related to the reorganisation chaired by BJP National General Secretary Arun Singh on Tuesday. Currently, the appointment of 30 block presidents remains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-releases-names-of-14-district-presidents/article32470632.ece
29 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Accountant held for siphoning off Rs. 2 cr. from employer for lewd chats||The Delhi police on Friday arrested an accountant of a Karol Bagh-based jeweller for allegedly spending Rs. 2 crore from the account of his employer on lewd live chats and watching adult content on a mobile application. The Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police arrested Mahesh Chand Badola, 42, a resident of the Burari area in north Delhi, on a complaint filed at the Karol Bagh police station by the jewellery firm. Joint CP (EOW) O.P. Mishra said Dinesh Kumar Gogna, on behalf of MC Jewels Private Ltd, Karol Bagh, filed a complaint against Badola and another man. The complainant, a co-owner of the firm, said Badola had been on the rolls for 17 years. Initially assigned duties of an accountant, he gained the trust of his employers over the years so much so that he was authorised to operate the company bank account and debit card for business-related payments. Badola linked the bank account to his personal phone number to make transactions. While scrutinising the company bank account, Mr. Gogna found that April 2019 onwards an amount of over Rs. 2 crore had been transferred through Paytm to an online application named Bigo Live. An FIR was duly registered in October 2019 and the case later transferred to EOW for further investigation. Paytm confirmed during investigation that the money had been transferred from the account of MC Jewels into Badola’s Paytm account and subsequently used for recharging his Bigo Live account. The Chinese-owned app, among the 59 banned by India recently, offers online live chat. Its India arm confirmed the transactions, prompting Badola to go off the radar. Declared a proclaimed offender in February this year, he was arrested on Friday from the Burari area on a tip-off, said Mr. Mishra. During interrogation, Badola reportedly confessed that he had registered on the app and got addicted to lewd live chats on it, and used to recharge his account via Paytm. The case is being investigated further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/accountant-held-for-siphoning-off-rs-2-cr-from-employer-for-lewd-chats/article32470635.ece

Fifty-nine people, including three women, gathered outside the residence of Mr. Kejriwal in north Delhi’s Civil Lines and expressed their disappointment over the government’s decision to not open gyms yet, they said. The detainees were taken to Civil Lines police station where they were formally arrested. A case under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and other Sections of the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act was registered against them. They were released on bail later. Before heading towards Mr. Kejriwal’s residence, the people staged a “ chakka jam” at Safdarjung Madarsa which led to the blockage of vehicular movement for over an hour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/many-detained-for-protesting-outside-cms-home-demanding-gym-reopening/article32470579.ece
29 August 2020||New Delhi,||Too many answer sheets to evaluate, say teachers||Members of the academic council of Delhi University wrote to the Vice Chancellor on Friday raising concerns over the evaluation of open book exams. Many teachers have reported that a large number of answer scripts have been assigned to them for evaluation, the letter states. Calling it unjust and unethical, the teachers wrote, “We are appalled to see how the authorities can be so callous by assigning a humongous number of sheets to an individual teacher.” They also added that a marking scheme or instructions for evaluation had not been provided. They argued that steps should have been taken to ensure uniformity of the evaluation process. Currently, they alleged that some teachers had even been given answer scripts of papers that they had not taught. On top of this, many teachers didn’t have laptops or desktops at home to undertake the evaluation. Highlighting that students had appeared for the exams despite the pandemic, the teachers argued that it was their moral responsibility to finish the evaluation process and declare the results at the earliest. Sought clear guidelines Asking the Vice Chancellor to take note of the issue, they demanded clear guidelines to be issued to ensure uniformity of evaluation and that subject specific evaluators be assigned 50 answer scripts at the most.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/too-many-answer-sheets-to-evaluate-say-teachers/article32470637.ece
29 August 2020||New Delhi,||Treat Gunjan Saxena plea as representation, Centre told||The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the Centre to treat as representation a petition seeking stay on streaming of a Netflix movie, ‘ Gunjan Saxena - The Kargil Girl ’. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan disposed of the plea by an NGO against the film starring Janhvi Kapoor, noting that the “shoulders of the armed forces are broad enough to protect its reputation”. If the Indian Air Force (IAF) has any objection, “let them take it up”, the High Court said while declining to entertain the plea, which has alleged that the film depicts the IAF in a bad light. “Why this kind of sensitivity to a movie or a book? Are our institutions so weak?” the High Court said. The NGO, Justice For Rights Foundation, had sought directions to the movie’s producers to modify or delete the alleged objectionable dialogues and scenes in the movie, which portrays the IAF in poor light. It also alleged that some scenes and dialogues in the movie are factually incorrect, misleading and portray an inappropriate work culture to glorify the screen character of the former flight lieutenant Gunjan Saxena.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/treat-gunjan-saxena-plea-as-representation-centre-told/article32470566.ece

Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar and other party workers were detained by the Delhi police. The party’s students’ wing, the NSUI, also continued its hunger strike over the same issue. Mr. Kumar said that COVID-19 cases have been witnessing a record spike across the country, and it would not be prudent to hold these exams now. He said that “the Modi-led government seems to be least bothered about the risk involved and the inconveniences the students would face if the NEET-JEE exams are held. Many students, who want to take the exams are either in containment zones, flood-affected areas or remote places and it would be very difficult for them to attend the exams if they are held now”. NSUI national president Neeraj Kundan said: “We will stop this satyagraha only when the Centre accepts our demands.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/deferment-of-neet-jee-cong-members-held-for-protesting/article32470573.ece

29 August 2020||August 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Now streaming: Korean, Turkish, Chinese||For those of us who grew up in the ‘90s, world cinema was Hollywood’s ‘arty’ cousin with subtitles. When UTV World Movies launched a few years later in India, people couldn’t shut up about directors like François Truffaut and Vittorio De Sica. I’d wondered: Eurocentric cinema is fine, but what do people in Japan or China watch on TV? The streaming era ended that speculation. Over the last few years, major streaming networks like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have been investing heavily in content from Asia, and smaller players like Dish TV and MX Player are now following suit. Indian audiences have been reciprocating, going beyond the predictable languages (like French and Italian). The lockdown has accelerated this. With more time on hand, people are bingeing on South Korean, Turkish, Chinese and Thai dramas. Netflix’s 2017 Spanish original series, La Casa de Papel ( Money Heist in English), is the streaming service’s most-watched international series in a non-English language, while Korean one-season dramas such as Healer and Itaewon Class , Turkish soaps Aşk-ı Memnu and Kuzey Güney , and Chinese shows The Untamed and Ashes of Love are popular examples. UK-based online market research firm YouGov’s 2019 report says 55% of Indians now watch foreign language content. ‘YouTube is the biggest platform for foreign content consumption’, it says. In fact, when Thai series Still 2Gether premiered on August 14, India ranked no 9 on producer GMMTV’s worldwide viewership list.  All things K  Hallyu (the Korean wave) isn’t new. For over a decade it has dominated playlists and vanity counters (K-pop, K-beauty — you name it, we’ve had it). In a 2019 interview with The Hindu , film editor Appu N Bhattathiri ( Drishyam ) highlighted how the International Film Festival of Kerala helped popularise Korean content. “K-dramas explore narratives that deal with the youth; I don’t think Indian television targets the youth like they do. Besides, access to Netflix, Amazon and so on has... created the urge to explore,” he says. Of late, social media, and forums on Reddit and Quora, are driving more people to K-drama. Mumbai-based influencer Scherezade ‘Sherry’ Shroff chanced upon this genre during lockdown. “Nobody does romance like they [Koreans] do. It may not always be realistic, but when you are watching a romantic show you want that bit of escape,” says Shroff, who recommends It’s Okay to Not Be Okay (no 3 on Netflix a few weeks ago), Descendants of the Sun and Guardian .  Digital players  While Amazon Prime, a leading player in the category, opted not to comment on this viewing trend, Dish TV, which launched their streaming service/app Watcho last April, says they have noticed and acted on the rising popularity of Korean dramas in India. “Earlier this month, we added a new feature called ‘Korean Drama Active’ on Dish TV and d2h platforms. Users can now watch their favourite shows dubbed in Hindi,” says Sukhpreet Singh, Corporate Head, Marketing. For now, Dish TV has added 300+ hours of K-dramas. Chennai is a surprising market too. A couple of years ago, journalist-author Krupa Ge, in a newspaper article, noted how popular these shows were among young girls in Tamil Nadu. Meanwhile, last November, Netflix signed a multi-year content production and distribution agreement with Korean entertainment company, CJ ENM, and its subsidiary, Studio Dragon.  Of culture and connections  But why are Korean — and more recently, Chinese, Thai and Japanese — shows so popular? “A show like Kingdom [Korean] has fantastical elements, like zombies. But the underlying emotional space occupied by Korean, or Japanese and Chinese characters for that matter, is something that resonates with Indians. We are all extremely emotional people!” says filmmaker Vishnuvardhan Kulasekaran, known for Kollywood films like Arrambam and Billa.  He particularly enjoys Chinese content: shows like The Untamed , a fantasy drama [about two magic-wielders battling demonic forces. Other favourites include the German fiction series Dark and Israeli action thriller Fauda , which he finds addictive. “All of them have very different settings, but it’s the emotions and the characters that resonate with you,” he says. These shows are also popular because of the underlying cultural similarities. “Grown-up kids still live with their parents, they [Asians] have the concept of arranged marriages, they don’t wear shoes in the house; there are so many overlaps,” says Shroff.  — With inputs from Surya Praphulla Kumar and Nidhi Adlakha        With subscriptions costing approximately Rs. 399 a month, Asian streaming platforms like Viki and Iqiyi — with original content such as Tower of Babel (Korean), My Strange Friend (Chinese) — are finding subscribers in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/now-streaming-korean-turkish-chinese/article32470598.ece
