08 October 2020||New Delhi,||SC: public places cannot be occupied indefinitely||The Supreme Court on Wednesday found the indefinite “occupation” of a public road by the Shaheen Bagh protesters unacceptable. The court said the protest, considered an iconic dissent mounted by mothers, children and senior citizens of Shaheen Bagh against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, became inconvenient to commuters. The 13-page judgment upheld the right to peaceful protest against a law but made it unequivocally clear that public ways and public spaces cannot be occupied, and that too indefinitely. “Democracy and dissent go hand in hand, but then the demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone. The present case was not even one of protests taking place in an undesignated area, but was a blockage of a public way which caused grave inconvenience to commuters,” Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who authored the verdict for a three-judge Bench, observed. The court suggested that the outcry may have even gone out of hand for the women protesters. It referred to reports about how women were ensconced inside a tent while a “huge periphery” of “male protesters, volunteers and bystanders”, who wanted the blockade to continue, milled around. While the tent occupied half the road, the other half was blocked by a 3-D map of India, a model of India Gate and even a library. Factors such as the absence of leadership and many “influencers” and groups working at cross-purposes saw the movement slip out of the hands of the women. “Thus, the Shaheen Bagh protest perhaps no longer remained the sole and empowering voice of women, who also appeared to no longer have the ability to call off the protest themselves. There was also the possibility of the protesters not fully realising the ramifications of the pandemic, coupled with a general unwillingness to relocate to another site.”  The court noted that Shaheen Bagh seemed typical of the many digitally-fuelled “leaderless” events of dissent seen in modern times. Technology and social media could both empower and weaken mass movements. “The ability to scale up quickly, for example, using digital infrastructure has empowered movements to embrace their often-leaderless aspirations and evade the usual restrictions of censorship. However, the flip side is that social media channels are often fraught with danger and can lead to the creation of highly polarised environments, which often see parallel conversations running with no constructive outcome evident,” Justice Kaul said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/public-spaces-cannot-be-occupied-says-sc/article32798627.ece
08 October 2020||Belagavi,||Farmer kills son over land dispute||Raibag Police arrested an 80-year-old farmer on the charge of killing his son over a property dispute on Wednesday. Channappa Anjure, the police said, killed Alagouda (38) by smashing his head with a rock while he slept in his courtyard. Anjure was angry that Alagouda was fighting with him for his share of the six acres of ancestral land. Alagouda had also upset his father by marrying twice, the police said. The last time the father and son fought, they did not go to the police station. Village elders held a meeting and made the two reconcile with their situation. However, they must have fought again recently, leading to the offence, a police officer said. A case has been registered in the Haroorgeri Police Station.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/farmer-kills-son-over-land-dispute/article32798750.ece
08 October 2020||CHENNAI,||Palaniswami is AIADMK CM candidate||Edappadi K. Palaniswami will be the ruling AIADMK’s candidate for Chief Minister in the 2021 Tamil Nadu Assembly election. This was announced by Deputy Chief Minister and party coordinator O. Panneerselvam at the party headquarters on Wednesday in the presence of senior leaders and Ministers. The announcement ended the unease in the party over the issue since August 15. As an indication of his agreeing to Mr. Panneerselvam’s principal demand for an 11-member steering committee, the Chief Minister made public the composition of the panel that would guide the organisation in all matters. Key demand The formation of the committee was one of the points of agreement at the time of merger of groups led by Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Panneerselvam in August 2017. A resolution adopted by the general council in September 2017, too, made a mention of the committee. Those who made it to the committee were Dindigul C. Sreenivasan, R. Kamaraj, P. Thangamani, S.P. Velumani, D. Jayakumar and C.Ve. Shanmugam, all Ministers; K. Manickam, Sholavandan MLA; P. Mohan, former Minister; P.H. Manoj Pandian and R. Gopalakrishnan, former Members of Parliament; and J.C.D. Prabhakar, former Villivakkam MLA. The first six were regarded as nominees of the Chief Minister and the last five were those of the Deputy Chief Minister. No woman leader was nominated. Former Ministers B. Valarmathi and Gokula Indira were said to be aspirants. Mr. Panneerselvam pointed out that the decision to make Mr. Palaniswami the party’s candidate for Chief Minister was in tune with the decision taken at a meeting chaired by presidium chairman E. Madhusudanan and attended by key functionaries. He said the decision was approved by senior office-bearers and the steering committee. The developments brought to a close the debate in the AIADMK in the last two months on the issue of candidate for Chief Minister. After the Deputy Chief Minister’s return to Chennai on Monday night from his home district of Theni, negotiations between the camps of the two leaders commenced on Tuesday morning and lasted till the early hours of Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/palaniswami-is-aiadmk-cm-candidate/article32798617.ece
08 October 2020||Mumbai,||HC grants bail to Rhea in drugs case||Actor Rhea Chakraborty, 28, was granted bail by the Bombay High Court on Wednesday. She had been in the Byculla jail after being arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau on September 8 in a drugs case following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. She was directed to be released from jail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 1 lakh, with one or two sureties in the amount. Justice S.V. Kotwal said, “The investigation did not reveal any recovery either from Rhea or from the house of Sushant Singh Rajput. It is their own case that the drugs were already consumed and hence there was no recovery. In that case, there is nothing at this stage to show that Rhea had committed any offence involving commercial quantity of contraband. The material at the highest shows that she has committed an offence involving contraband, but the crucial element of incurring rigours of Section 37 [offences to be cognizable and non-bailable] in respect of commercial quantity is missing.” The court added, “Therefore, I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the applicant that is Rhea is not guilty of any offence punishable under Sections 19 [punishment for embezzlement of opium by cultivator], 24 [punishment for external dealings in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances] or 27A [punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders] [of the Narcotics Drugs Psychotropic Substances Act] or any other offence involving commercial quantity.” The court granted bail to Sushant’s domestic aides Dipesh Sawant and Samuel Miranda, but rejected Ms. Chakraborty’s brother, Showik Chakraborty’s bail plea.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-grants-bail-to-rhea-in-drugs-case/article32798632.ece
08 October 2020||Kolkata,||City of Joy caught between fear and festivities||How bad the COVID-19 situation is going to get is a question that appears to be uppermost on the minds of people in Kolkata, where the healthcare system is already under strain at a time when the city is all set to open up for festivities. On October 15, theatres across the city and the rest of West Bengal will open. As many as 12 Bengali films, perhaps the highest ever, are set to be released on that day. While some of them were intended for a Puja release, some others were supposed to be released earlier but could not be because of the lockdown. Theatres, of course, will have to follow procedures — only 50% occupancy, staggered shows, audience giving their phone number for contact tracing, and so on — but people would still be at risk. Shopping spree The opening of the theatres will be followed by Durga Puja, which is barely two weeks away, and since the State government has given its go-ahead for the celebrations to be held, albeit with some restrictions, people are now out shopping. A recent picture from the well-known footwear store, Sreeleathers, is being shared widely on social media: it can be seen packed with shoppers. The scene is hardly different in other well-known stores where shoppers traditionally flock before Puja. If one were to discount the masks — which, in most cases, either sit below the nose or under the chin — it would seem life is normal. The scene, however, is very different in hospitals. There is even panic in some places, such as the iconic Medical College on College Street. On Tuesday, its principal sent an SOS to the Director of Health Services urgently asking for more doctors. Shortage of doctors “Presently, 26 postgraduate trainees, including 12 faculty members, have tested positive for COVID-19 and are either quarantined or undergoing treatment. As such, the Medical College is facing an acute shortage of doctors with the enhancement of 100 beds. Hence [I request] you to post/detail senior residents with specialisation in MD (medicine), preferably ex-students of this institution, to cater effective and adequate care to patients admitted [here],” the principal wrote. Dr. Punyabrata Gun, convenor of West Bengal Doctors’ Forum, said, “So many doctors getting infected is a serious matter. It becomes more serious as we are anticipating a manifold rise in the number of cases after Durga Puja. There will be acute shortage of human resources.” According to him, the situation had almost come under control in Kolkata, with the numbers dropping in the city but rising in the districts, but after Mahalaya and Vishwakarma Puja, the graph climbed up again. “We fear the number of cases will again rise after Puja,” Dr. Gun said. On Tuesday, West Bengal saw the highest number of daily deaths so far: 63. The number of daily cases in the State continues to hover around the 3,000 mark.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/city-of-joy-caught-between-fear-and-festivities/article32798833.ece
08 October 2020||MYSURU,||Mysore varsity to start 13 online courses||The University of Mysore will soon be launching online courses, with the University Grants Commission (UGC) giving its nod for 13 of them[10 postgraduate and three undergraduate]. The courses were ratified at a special Academic Council meeting here on Wednesday. Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar, who chaired the meeting, said the online courses were there earlier but were discontinued. The unviversity approached the UGC seeking permission and the same was approved. Accordingly, the courses were placed before the council for its approval. The academic council also gave its nod for opening five new first-grade degree colleges in its jurisdiction, besides continuing the affiliation of 169 first-grade colleges in Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, and Hassan districts. After the meeting, Prof. Kumar told The Hindu that the inspection of colleges for the renewal of affiliation was hit owing to COVID-19. The inspection was completed October 3. With council approval, the list of affiliated colleges will be sent to the Department of Higher Education, he said. As many as 78 colleges in Mysuru, 17 in Chamarajanagar, 32 in Mandya, and 42 in Hassan had been affiliated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mysore-varsity-to-start-13-online-courses/article32798920.ece
08 October 2020||MYSURU,||Dasara: Expert team will visit Mysuru, says Sriramulu||Minister for Health and Family Welfare B. Sriramulu on Wednesday said an expert team would be visiting Mysuru in connection with organising safe Dasara celebrations amid COVID-19 pandemic. An action plan had to be prepared by the Health Department incorporating precautions within 48 hours of the team submitting its report, he added. At a meeting here to review COVID-19 situation, the Minister said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had advised Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Dasara celebrations and precautions to be taken to contain the spread of the pandemic. It had become inevitable to celebrate Dasara in the simplest and traditional way as cases were mounting in Mysuru with each passing day, he said. He said the government alone cannot manage the situation since the citizens too had equal responsibilities and they had to comply with the government’s advisories on the pandemic. Elected representatives told the Minister that Dasara celebrations should be as simple as possible without public gathering in view of the surge in COVID-19 cases. Tanveer Sait, MLA; Pratap Simha, MP; A.H. Vishwanath, MLC; and Rohini Sindhuri, Deputy Commissioner, attended the meeting.  It has become inevitable to celebrate Dasara in the simplest and traditional way. B.

08 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Daily cases cross 10,000 mark in State||The State’s daily case burden of COVID-19 crossed the 10,000 mark on Wednesday, to register 10,606 cases, which took the cumulative case burden to 2,53,405 cases. The State registered this highest single-day spike when the tests done in the past 24 hours were hiked to 73,816, which is again the highest number of tests to have been done in a single day. Test positivity rate is steady at 14.3% even when tests have been hiked by over 10,000 than the previous highest test figures, indicating that community transmission is intense so that more tests would yield more cases. The earlier projections had speculated that the State would record over 10,000 cases daily when the epidemic curve reached the peak. However, going by the current trends, the epidemic peak could be many more weeks away, it is believed. The State recorded the highest number of hospital discharges in a single day on Wednesday when 6,161 people were reported to have recovered from the disease. With a total of 1,60,253 persons having recovered till date, the burden of active cases is inching towards the one lakh mark. The number of persons currently undergoing treatment is 92,161. Among the active cases, the number of patients who are critically ill and are being treated in ICUs jumped to 610, with another 179 requiring ventilator support. The death toll rose to 906, with 22 more deaths. Thiruvananthapuram accounted for 14 of these deaths, Malappuram five and Idukki, Alappuzha and Kollam recording one case each. In the new cases, 97.9% or 10,387 cases are locally acquired infections, of which 741 cases are yet to be linked to a known source of infection. The new cases also include the infections reported in 98 health-care workers. Among districts, four districts registered over 1,000 cases, with Kozhikode registering the highest number of cases at 1,576, Malappuram 1,350, Ernakulam 1,201 and Thiruvananthapuram 1,182 cases. Thrissur has 948 cases, Kollam 852, Alappuzha 672, Palakkad 650, Kannur 602, Kottayam 490, Kasaragid 432, Pathanamthitta 393, Wayanad 138 and Idukki 120. When the number of active cases are considered, Thiruvananthapuram is still leading with 12,867 cases. The sudden surge in cases in all other districts has resulted in 12,267 cases in Ernakulam and 11,161 cases in Kozhikode. Kollam is next with 8,596 cases, where the surge is worrisome and is likely to go beyond the system’s capacity. The number of hotspots at present is 720.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/daily-cases-cross-10000-mark-in-state/article32798788.ece
08 October 2020||Idukki,||Idukki set to take a green turn||Idukki district, which hosts the largest hydroelectric project in the State, is turning towards green energy with the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) set to tap power from floating solar panels to be installed on the Idukki reservoir. In the first phase of the project set to begin in December, 125 MW will be generated. This is in line with the Centre’s stress on generation of green and renewable energy from non-conventional sources. The large water spread of the reservoir makes it an ideal green energy hub, in addition to the chance of easy transfer of power by underwater cables to the KSEB power grid. When the project is realised, the district will become the largest producer of green energy in the State. An official of REES (Renewable Energy and Energy Saving) under the KSEB said on Wednesday that a survey by the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) found the reservoir suitable to install floating solar panels. 125 MW in first phase As per its report, 125 MW will be generated in the first phase and 200 MW more in two years. The panels will be installed in the Anchuruli area of the reservoir (100 MW) and the Cheruthoni area (25 MW) in the first phase. As per an agreement, the NTPC will implement the solar power project on the reservoir and the KSEB will purchase power from the NTPC. The KSEB will set up a 220-kV substation at Nirmalacity, near Kattappana, to transfer energy produced from the floating solar panels, the official said. The largest floating solar panels in the country were installed at the Banasura Sagar reservoir in 2017, covering a water spread of 1.25 acres, with capacity to produce 500 kW. Floating solar panels have higher efficiency compared to ground installed panels due to the control of panel temperature by waterbodies. The panels are installed on a ferro cement floater to move in accordance with water movements. Cost reduction The high cost of installing the panels and the mode to transfer power make floating solar panels less preferable as a green energy source. However, fast technological upgrades are taking place to reduce the cost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/idukki-set-to-take-a-green-turn/article32798786.ece
08 October 2020||KALABURAGI,||Police shoot at murder accused||The Kalaburagi Police shot at and injured Mubeen alias Abdul Rehman, an accused in a murder case, after he tried to attack them and escape from their custody near Taj Sultanpur village on the outskirts of the city on Wednesday morning. The police took Mubeen to Taj Sultanpur to recover lethal weapons used for killing a migrant worker in August. The police opened fire at the accused when Mubeen tried to attack the officials with a knife. Mubeen was admitted to the District General Hospital, while two injured policemen were treated at a private hospital. As per a complaint lodged at the Rural Police Station, Mubeen, along with two of his friends, Mohammad Zakriya and Mohammad Sajid, waylaid an Uttar Pradesh-based workers a month ago and stabbed him to death when he tried to resist a bid to snatch his mobile phone. The accused was absconding for the last one month. The police apprehended him on Tuesday night.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/police-shoot-at-murder-accused/article32798751.ece
08 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||CM for stricter measures to prevent attacks on Dalits||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has directed the police officials to take all precautionary measures to prevent the scope for occurrence of any untoward incidents against Dalits. The police should focus on the preventive measures and be on alert all the time. The responsibility of preventing attacks on the weaker sections by stronger ones was lying with the police and therefore, the need for scaling up the preventive measures. The Chief Minister made these remarks while reviewing the functioning of the Home and Forest departments with senior officials on Wednesday. He said it was unfortunate that incidents of atrocities against Dalits were being reported from different parts of the country in spite of the measures initiated. He directed the police officials – from higher officials to lower ones – to become part of the society and perform “friendly policing” giving respect to each and every citizen without discrimination and thereby, enhance spirit of policing. The officials concerned should adopt humanitarian approach when the weak and meek approach them for help and protection. On the other issues, the Chief Minister said since the formation of Telangana State, one of the major achievements of the government was eradication of manufacture and sale of illicit liquor. However, there were reports suggesting that some illicit liquor manufacturing was taking place in a few places following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. “This has to be stopped forthwith,” he said. The police and Excise officials who worked for making Telangana illicit liquor-free State should work with the same zeal in coordination. The police should also be on alert about social evils like gambling and deal stringently with those indulging in such activities. The government had given special attention to women protection and the police should put extra efforts in this direction. There was a need to control and eradicate the sale and supply of banned substances like ganja which were harmful to society, especially the younger generation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/prevent-attacks-on-dalits-says-kcr/article32799247.ece
08 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||13 lakh women receive self-defence training||Nearly 13 lakh girls and women have received self-defence training as part of the State government’s Sadhairyam Munnottu programme. The training, based on Krav Maga, a self-defence and fighting system developed for security forces in Israel, is being provided by the State police. The focus is on self-defence without the use of arms and incapacitating the enemy. The training will help ward off surprise attacks on women and children. Recognising attacks beforehand, learning how not to get trapped in such situations, and developing mental and physical strength to fight the attackers are some of the goals. Sports training for increasing physical health and tips to overcome attackers without losing strength are some of the lessons imparted, a release here said.  Select women police personnel are the trainers. Each district has four master trainers. Training is provided in schools, colleges, Kudumbashree units, offices, residents’ associations, and so on. Each individual is given 20 hours of training. In 2019-20, 18,055 people received the training in Thiruvananthapuram district alone. It was conducted in 68 schools and 31 colleges. As many as 162 Kudumbashree units and residents’ associations too have completed training. Confidence booster Those who have received training cite an increase in self-confidence about personal safety. Instances of preventing sexual harassment on public transport or fending off chain-snatchers too have been reported.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/13-lakh-women-receive-self-defence-training/article32798793.ece
08 October 2020||Lucknow,||Journalist, 3 others booked for sedition in U.P.||The Uttar Pradesh police on Wednesday booked journalist Siddique Kappan from Kerala and three others on sedition and other charges. The four were arrested on Monday while they were on their way to Hathras. They were produced before a local court, which remanded them in judicial custody. “Further action will be taken after collection of evidence in the investigation,” said Mathura SSP Gaurav Grover. An FIR lodged against them at the Mant police station charges them under Section 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code; Sections 14 and 17 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA); Sections 65, 72 and 76 of the Information Technology Act, and for promoting enmity between groups and outraging religious feelings. Section 17 of the UAPA deals with raising funds for terrorist acts. The four were taken into custody at a toll plaza in Mathura when they were travelling in a car from Delhi to Hathras, the police said. The car was stopped after the police found their activities “suspicious”. Besides Mr. Kappan, a journalist working with Malayalam portals based in Delhi, the other three were identified as Ateeq-ur-Rehman of Muzaffarnagar, Masood Ahmed of Bahraich and Alam of Rampur. While Mr. Ahmed and Rehman are research scholars, Mr. Alam was the driver of the car, said Ansar Indori, their lawyer. In the FIR, sub-inspector Prabal Singh accuses the four of carrying pamphlets reading ‘Justice for Hathras Victim’ and moving towards the district to disrupt peace as part of a “big conspiracy”. Website creation The FIR alleged that they, along with unidentified others, were linked to a crime involving the creation of an Internet platform carrd.co and website named ‘justiceforhathras’ with the motive of gathering foreign funds to trigger caste riots. The pamphlets recovered from the four, reading: ‘Am I not India’s Daughter, Made With Carrd’, could spread social discord and mass rebellion, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/journalist-3-others-booked-for-sedition-in-up/article32798662.ece
08 October 2020||New Delhi,||‘Prepare for winter surge of 15K cases’||A report prepared by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and submitted to the Delhi government earlier this week states that Delhi should prepare for a surge of 15,000 positive cases per day during the winter months. As many as 2,324 healthcare workers in the city have been infected by COVID-19 and 75 of them have died, says the yet-to-be-made-public ‘Revised Strategy for control of COVID-19 version 3.0’. It also suggests the death figure may be “under-reported”. The government is expected to come up with a revised strategy based on the report, which was prepared in consultation with an expert group headed by NITI Aayog member V.K Paul. Last month, Lt. Governor Anil Baijal had directed to prepare a revised plan to fight the virus. Patients from outside “It is recommended that Delhi should prepare for a daily surge of about 15,000 positive cases and make arrangements for inpatient admissions of patients and moderate and severe disease roughly amounting to 20 percent of this surge (sic),” says the report, seen byThe Hindu. Explaining why the Capital should prepare for a surge of 15,000 cases a day, the report says winter months make respiratory illnesses more severe and patients from outside Delhi, who are likely to be “more serious”, may come in “large numbers”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/prepare-for-winter-surge-of-15k-cases/article32799207.ece

The order, dated October 6, and released in the name of Delhi Chief Secretary Vijay Dev, stated that theatres can open from October 15 with 50% capacity while all weekly markets can open with immediate effect. The relaxations do not apply to containment zones. The Delhi government attributed the order to the ‘persistent efforts’ of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. “Now all weekly markets of Delhi will open. Till now only two markets per zone were allowed. The poor will get a lot of relief from this. Cinema halls of Delhi will also be opened from October 15. They have to follow all the guidelines issued by the Central government,” Mr. Kejriwal tweeted. Earlier, the DDMA had ordered a status quo regarding relaxation of restrictions in the city. The reopening of cinema halls will be subject to “strict compliance” of the SOP for Exhibition of Films on preventive measures to contain spread of COVID-19, as well as other directions/instructions issued by the Delhi government and the DDMA.

The letter written by Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Krishnakant, sent to the Police Commissioner with a copy to the Director-General and Inspector-General of Police, has gone viral now bringing to the fore the differences within the Police Commissionerate. The letter clearly indicates that Mr. Krishnakant is upset with the way Police Commissioner of Hubballi Dharwad R. Dileep has behaved with him. In his letter of October 3, sent through the Control Room to the Police Commissioner, Mr. Krishnakant has expressed displeasure over the Police Commissioner not giving him an appointment to meet him and discuss sensitive details pertaining to a case. According to the letter, repeated attempts to meet the Police Commissioner have failed. Mr. Krishnakant has said that phone calls to the Police Commissioner were not answered and were, instead, diverted to subordinates with a message that his calls would be returned, which, however, have not happened so far. He has in the letter mentioned that he has been deputed on COVID-19-related works and he would not be able to reveal sensitive issues concerning cases over wireless communication and had requested for an appointment to discuss them in person, which, however, has not been met. Meanwhile, both the officials have declined to comment on the issue. Takes exception Meanwhile, district in-charge Minister Jagadish Shettar has taken exception to the development and has said that such developments would hamper the smooth functioning of the department and maintenance of law and order. He has said that he would take up the issue with senior police officials and the Home Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/a-letter-to-police-commissioner-from-upset-dcp-goes-viral/article32798752.ece

08 October 2020||PATNA,||Bihar poll: BJP gives 11 of its seats to VIP||The Bhartiya Janata Party on Wednesday gave 11 seats from its quota to Mukesh Sahni-led Vikashil Insaan Party, the new entrant to the National Democratic Alliance in Bihar. Earlier, the two major alliance partners had shared the 243 Assembly seats between themselves: the JD(U) 122 and the BJP 121. The three-phase elections to the Assembly are scheduled to begin on October 28. On Tuesday, the JD(U) allocated seven seats from its quota to another alliance partner, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), led by former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi. “We have allocated 11 seats and one State council seat to VIP… The BJP has always respected people from Extremely Backward Castes … in the previous Assembly poll, our party gave 25 seats to EBS candidates, of which they won 12,” senior State BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi said. “It was the NDA government that came up with 20% reservation for the EBC in panchayat polls and today over 1,600 mukhias [village heads] in Bihar are from these castes,” he said. Mr. Sahni said he was happy to return to the NDA. “I had started my political innings in the 2014 Lok Sabha election with the aim of making Narendra Modi the Prime Minister,” he said. Earlier on October 2, Mr. Sahni had stunned the grand alliance leaders by making an abrupt exit from the press meet called to announce the seat allocation among alliance partners. “I was stabbed in the back and cheated,” Mr. Sahni said while making a hasty exit. The VIP has been given Brahmpur, Bochaha, Gaura Bauram, Simri Bakhtiyarpur, Sugauli, Madhubani, Kewati, Sahebganj, Balrampur, Ali Nagar and Baniapur.  BJP leaders join LJP Meanwhile, senior BJP leaders Rameshwar Chourasia and Usha Vidyarthi joined the Lok Janshakti Party on Wednesday, triggering speculation that the LJP is contesting the upcoming poll as a “proxy” for the BJP. BJP State vice-president and former senior RSS functionary Rajendra Singh too joined the LJP and is set to contest from Dinara against JD(U) candidate and Minister in the Nitish Kumar Cabinet Jai Kumar Singh. LJP sources told The Hindu that many more BJP leaders were in touch with the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bihar-poll-bjp-gives-11-of-its-seats-to-vip/article32798561.ece

From one lab in January, we now have 1,889 spread across the country. We have confidence in the scientific developments taking place in the field of treatment, and vaccines for COVID-19, and soon India will achieve more success in our fight against COVID-19,” he said. Appropriate behaviour The Minister also urged people to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour, and said that at the moment, they should use the social vaccine of wearing masks or face covers in public places, following hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, and maintaining physical distancing or ‘ do gaz ki doori ’ to curb the spread of the infection. The Minister said the number of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) facilities had increased from six to 22, while another 75 existing institutions are envisioned to be upgraded to provide AIIMS-like services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/use-social-vaccine-of-masks-hygiene-minister/article32798578.ece
08 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||78 additional special trains to be run||The Railways have decided to run 78 additional trains, taking the total number of special passenger services operational in the country to 388. In a notification to all the zones, the Railways have asked that 39 pairs of trains, mainly AC Express, Duronto, Vande Bharat, Rajdhani and the Shatabdi services, “should be introduced as special trains from an early convenient date”. A Railways spokesperson clarified that these trains were separate from the 200 festive passenger trains that they planned to run between October 15 and November 30 to cater to the festive season demand. Tejas services to resume The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) announced plans to restart two corporate-run trains — the Lucknow-New Delhi Tejas Express and the Ahmedabad-Mumbai Tejas Express from October 17, nearly seven months after the operations were suspended owing to the pandemic. The IRCTC said this was being done to cater to the growing passenger demand due to the festive season. Every alternate seat would be kept vacant to ensure the social distancing norm and passengers would not be allowed to exchange their seats once seated. Additionally, use of face covers/masks would be mandatory for passengers and staff. “All travellers will install the ‘Arogya Setu’ app and the same will be shown as and when demanded. Detailed instructions will be given to the passengers at the time of booking of tickets,” the IRCTC said.

08 October 2020||KOCHI,||UAE consulate officials need to be probed: NIA||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is planning to probe the involvement of some officials in the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram in the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case. The agency informed the NIA Special Court here on Wednesday that the active or passive role of some consulate officials in the smuggling of gold under the cover of diplomatic baggage and whether some others had facilitated the illegal activities need to be found out. More clarity would be obtained in these aspects after obtaining the custody of Faisal Fareed and Rabins Hameed, who were arrested in the UAE on Tuesday. Opposing the bail application of six accused in the case, P. Vijayakumar, Assistant Solicitor General, said a larger conspiracy was hatched among over 30 people and international connections were involved in the case. Many of the accused had invested huge money into smuggling for the purchase of gold. Over Rs. 100 crore was suspected to be involved in the deal. Arjun Ampalapatta, senior public prosecutor of the agency, said the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau had alerted the NIA in October last year that the proceeds of the gold smuggling through the Karipur airport might be used for terror funding and anti-national activities. The court asked the agency whether it could gather any evidence to prove the terror funding angle of the case after around 85 days of taking over the investigation. As the prosecution explained the modus operandi of the smugglers, the court wondered whether the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act could be invoked in all cases of smuggling as it did in the diplomatic baggage case. The court, which would look into the confessional statement of Sandeep Nair on Monday, may pass its orders on the bail applications on the day or Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/uae-consulate-officials-need-to-be-probed-nia/article32798546.ece
08 October 2020||New Delhi,||GJM demands formation of Gorkhaland State||Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy on Wednesday met representatives of the Bimal Guru faction of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) at North Block. The group demanded the creation of a State of Gorkhaland comprising Darjeeling and the adjoining hill districts in West Bengal. The Home Ministry had convened the meeting to discuss “issues related to the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration [GTA]”. The GTA is a regional autonomous body formed as a result of tripartite agreement between the West Bengal government, the Centre and the GJM in 2011. Another faction of the GJM is led by Benoy Tamang. Currently, it wields control of the GTA and has the backing of the ruling Trinamool Congress. Mr. Gurung is wanted by the West Bengal police under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act) following the 100-day unrest in the region in 2017. No State representation No representative of the West Bengal government attended the Wednesday meeting. GJM working president Lopsang Lama, who attended the meeting, said they did not discuss the GTA, but submitted a memorandum demanding the creation of Gorkhaland. “We did not discuss anything about the GTA. It has failed and we informed the Home Ministry about it. We want a permanent solution and demand the creation of ‘Gorkhaland’ as promised by the BJP in its election manifesto,” Mr. Lama, former vice-president of the GTA, said after the meeting. Another GJM leader, Kalyan Dewan, said the Union Minister gave them a patient hearing and assured them that the dialogue on their demands would continue. Later, in a statement, Mr. Lama said the seven-member delegation raised the Gorkhaland demand and grant of Scheduled Tribe status to 11 Gorkha sub-communities. The statement said, “When the GTA issue was raised, the GJM delegation submitted that the delegation was there to discuss the statehood demand and grant of Scheduled Tribe status and not the GTA since the Memorandum of Agreement signed between the Union of India, the government of West Bengal and the GJM in 2011 was not honoured by the State of West Bengal.” The memorandum submitted by the GJM delegation mentioned about the alleged “irregularities, interferences and obstacles committed by the State government, thereby rendering the GTA defunct”. The GJM said that moreover, all the elected members of the GTA had resigned en masse in 2017, rejecting the said body. The delegation further submitted on the issue of Gorkhaland being the oldest statehood demand in the country and presented various materials supporting it, the statement said. “The hon’ble minister, after giving a patient audience, assured the delegation that the government would consider all the materials presented before it and announce the next meeting after speaking with the Hon’ble Union Home Minister Amit Shah and briefing him about the contents of today’s meeting,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gjm-demands-formation-of-gurkhaland-state/article32798585.ece
08 October 2020||New Delhi,||Congress releases first list for Bihar||Barely 24 hours before the process of filing nominations for the first phase of the Bihar Assembly elections gets over, the Congress on Wednesday released its first list of 21 candidates. Election for the first phase in the three-phase election will be held on October 28. The party nominated Shubhanand Mukesh, who is the son of the Congress Legislature Party leader in Bihar Sadanand Singh, a nine-term MLA, for the Kahalgaon Assembly seat. Even though the list was formally released late on Wednesday evening, Mr. Mukesh had already filed his nomination as the party’s candidate earlier in the day. Another notable candidate was Akhauri Onkar Nath from Gaya, who was a last minute replacement as the party’s earlier nominee, a powerful local politician, was dropped following rape charges against him. On Tuesday, The Hindu had reported that the party had withheld three names as they faced serious charges of crimes against women. Former Bihar Youth Congress chief Lallan Yadav has been given a ticket from the Sultanganj seat. The last minute announcement was part of the party’s strategy to avoid a backlash from aspirants who did not find a place among the successful candidates, said a source. Of the 21 candidates, while five sittings MLAs have found a place, an equal number of newcomers who recently joined the party have also been accommodated, creating a sense of resentment among party old-timers. “The central leaders knew that if they had announced the names earlier, then there would have been greater scrutiny. That’s why they individually informed the candidates on phone to keep their papers ready but announced the list only now,” said a Bihar Congress leader who did not wish to be named. Earlier, the central election committee of the party, headed by party chief Sonia Gandhi, cleared their names. The Congress will be contesting on 70 seats as part of the Rashtriya Janata Dal-led ‘grand alliance’ in Bihar. Polling in the three phase elections will be held on October 28, November 3 and November 7.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-releases-first-list-for-bihar/article32798574.ece

Seethakka has questioned the silence of the Telangana government over the rape of a 13-year-old girl from Khammam and attempt to murder her. She is now battling for her life in Osmania General Hospital. Ms. Seethakka, along with TPCC spokesperson Indira Shobhan and a team of Congress workers, who visited the girl in the hospital, said it was unfortunate that a Minister or even an MLA had not visited the family even 18 days after the horrific incident. She said the government did not even shift the girl with 70% burns to a private hospital for better treatment. “This government is blind and deaf to the rape of a Dalit girl and it is shameful that none from the government has responded so far,” she remarked. According to the police, the girl was allegedly set ablaze after she resisted the attempt by the son of the owner of a house where she was a domestic help. As she resisted and tried to escape, the accused allegedly poured kerosene on her and set her ablaze.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/why-is-govt-silent-on-minor-girls-rape/article32798544.ece
08 October 2020||Hyderabad,||IIT-H to offer B.Tech in bio-medical engineering||To train biomedical engineers in next-generation healthcare technologies and prepare them to work at the frontiers of healthcare innovations in the deep-tech industry or academia, IIT-Hyderabad is introducing a B. Tech course in bio-medical engineering. It will be the first IIT in the country to offer the programme. Osmania University College of Engineering in Hyderabad is one of the few colleges that offers the programme in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh as of now. The new B.Tech programme trains students to design medical devices, develop 3D imagers and microscopes, crunch mountains of healthcare data, recognise patterns in health and disease, simulate and predict spread of epidemics mixing medical needs with engineering technologies. IIT-Hyderabad B.S. Murty said the curriculum is designed around four verticals — bio-imaging and sensing, bio-mechanics, bio-materials and bio-intelligence and artificial intelligence. “They rest on a single horizontal — core training in physiology, anatomy, systems science, mathematics, circuits, instrumentation, mechanics and algorithms,” he explained. Indigenous devices The programme will help bring out indigenous medical devices of high quality that serve all sections of the country, the IIT-H director asserted. “One of the unique aspects of our programme is an advanced module on biomedical product design, entrepreneurship, regulatory affairs and clinical immersion that brings in a core product design and development focus,” he added,||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/iit-h-to-offer-btech-in-bio-medical-engineering/article32798931.ece
08 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Bidders seek extension of deadline for TS secretariat||The government has expedited steps to start constructing the new integrated secretariat complex with the pre-bid meeting of interested contracting firms getting under way on Wednesday. The meeting was convened in line with the tender schedule issued in the last week of September. The pre-bid meeting will be followed by opening of technical bids on October 13 and price bids on October 16. The meeting went on smoothly with some of the prospective bidders asking the government to extend the construction deadline from the existing 12 months to at least 18 months. The contractors also wanted the State government to pay mobilisation advance so that they can commence the works at the earliest besides ensuring payments on a monthly basis without fail. The State government, according to sources, insisted that the project should be completed within one year, in line with the wishes of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. Regarding mobilisation advance, the government ruled out scope for any such payments, but contractors were assured of timely payments every month. “We don’t give mobilisation advance to any project as a policy,” a senior Roads and Buildings official told The Hindu . The pre-bid meeting was conducted after a delay of about 10 days as the total built up area of the proposed secretariat has been increased from 66,479.92 sq.m (7.15 lakh sq.ft) to 70,315.19 sq.m (7.56 lakh sq.ft).

08 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||India, Japan finalise text of pact for AI, 5G||India and Japan on Wednesday welcomed the finalisation of the text of a cybersecurity agreement that will promote cooperation in key areas such as 5G network and Artificial Intelligence. The announcement on the agreement followed the 13th India-Japan Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue between External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and his Japanese counterpart Motegi Toshimitsu in Tokyo. “The two ministers... welcomed the finalisation of the text of the cybersecurity agreement. The agreement promotes cooperation in capacity building, research and development, security and resilience in the areas of Critical Information Infrastructure, 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), among others”, a statement from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said. It, however, did not clarify what role each country would play under this. The announcement is expected to draw the attention of the stakeholders in the Indian 5G sector as it gets ready to open up for international operators and especially since there is lack of clarity on possible participation of Chinese technology majors in the 5G arena. The two Ministers also exchanged ideas on regional and global issues of “mutual interest and agreed that the strong and enduring partnership between the two countries will play a pivotal role in overcoming challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic”. The ongoing military tension along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh was expected to feature in the talks but the official statements did not elaborate on that point. The Ministers reiterated that the Indo-Pacific region has become more important in the current global circumstances, and reaffirmed similarities in their vision. The Japanese Foreign Minister highlighted the 50 billion Yen emergency assistance loan and a 1 billion Yen grant for provision of medical support to India that will help India fight COVID-19. He also raised the issue of abduction of Japanese nationals by North Korea and asked for early resolution. Mr. Jaishankar’s conveyed India’s support to finding a closure. Jaishankar, Payne meet Mr. Jaishankar also met his Australian counterpart Marise Payne on Wednesday.

08 October 2020||Washington,||Quad worried about China’s ‘gross aggression’||A senior State Department official cited ‘sudden’ and “gross aggression” by China as a concern of the Quad, in response to a question on whether Quad members other than the U.S. were less “forward-leaning” on countering the Chinese threat, and whether the U.S. risked alienating the other three countries with its emphasis on China. “No. That is the concern. I mean, if you look at the conflict on the — in the Himalayas between China and India, something that has been in the past handled according to unspoken or unwritten rules in the past to prevent these things from getting out of control, and then you look at what happened here recently, where you’ve got actually people beating each other to death — no,” the official said. “… If you look at the single thing that’s driving all this, it’s a sudden turn toward gross aggression by the Chinese government in its entire periphery. I mean, you take it all the way around the Indo-Pacific and its western borders; you’re seeing things that you haven’t seen before, and these are responding to that,” the official said. Later, the official reiterated that it was not “not just the U.S. dragging folks [ i.e., India, Australia, Japan] who are maybe unwilling or hesitant to” take on the challenges that China was posing. “Everybody likeminded is looking at erosion of democracy, of free market economy and all that, and they’re taking action.” The comments, transcripts of which were released by the State Department, were made on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s aircraft en route to Anchorage, from Japan, where Mr. Pompeo had met External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and counterparts Toshimitsu Motegi of Japan and Marise Payne of Australia for the second “Quad” Minister-level meeting. In Tokyo, Mr. Pompeo had said it was ‘critical’ for Quad partners to “collaborate to protect our people and partners from the CCP’s [Chinese Communist Party] exploitation, corruption, and coercion,” in various geographies including the Himalayas. “But we also have to frame the problem correctly. This isn’t about a U.S.-China dispute. This is about the free world versus Chinese authoritarianism,” a second senior State Department official said. Asked on speculation by analysts that the Quad sounded like an “Asian NATO”, the first official said looking at the language underpinning the framework of cooperation was on the to-do list for the countries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/quad-worried-about-chinas-gross-aggression/article32798591.ece
08 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Constitute State council for clinical establishment: PIL||Telangana High Court on Wednesday issued notices to the Central and State governments in a PIL petition seeking direction for establishment of ‘State Council for Clinical Establishment’. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy, after hearing contentions of the petitioner, instructed the State government to file a counter affidavit within four weeks. The petition was filed by a voluntary organisation Forum Against Corruption president Vijay Gopal. He stated in the plea that the Centre had brought out Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act-2010. It was notified by the Parliament on February 28, 2012. While many States did not adopt the Act, Telangana State adopted it by passing a resolution in the Assembly on March 25, 2017. The petitioner contended that as per Section 8 of the Act, the government should create a State Council for Clinical Establishments. Not creating the council had created a situation where people availing services of private hospitals found no system to redress their grievances, the petitioner said. Mr. Vijay Gopal sought a direction to State government to constitute ‘District Registering Authorities’ as per the Act along with setting up State Council for Clinical Establishments. He asked the court to direct the government to release the approved standard list of medical procedures for treating different patients. The petitioner said the government should also release standard template for costs of medical procedures as approved by the National Council for Clinical Establishments as per rule 9 (ii) of the Act. In some cities, hospitals were being operated illegally. There was no mechanism to look into allegations of excessive charges being imposed on patients. There is no system of ensuring adequate facilities by such hospitals set up in districts. Patients and their families are in a state of confusion as to whom they should approach to secure justice, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/constitute-state-council-for-clinical-establishment-pil/article32799224.ece
08 October 2020||Bengaluru,||Karnataka cuts fine for not wearing mask||Barely a week after the State government increased fines for not wearing a mask properly to Rs. 1,000 in urban areas and Rs. 500 in rural areas, it made a U-turn on its decision in the face of public opposition. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Wednesday reduced the fines to Rs. 250 in urban areas and Rs. 100 in rural areas. Prior to the increase, violators were fined Rs. 200. The government’s decision to increase the amount to Rs. 1,000 did not go down well with many activists and citizens’ groups, who felt it would engender corruption. On Wednesday, protests were held by citizens in front of the BBMP’s office in Jayanagar against the prohibitive fines. Later in the day, Mr. Yediyurappa in a statement said the fines had been reduced following widespread objections. He urged people to voluntarily wear masks, maintain a social distance, and help the government in its efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19. This is not the first time that the government has attempted to raise fines. When masks were first made mandatory in Bengaluru this May, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) fixed the penalty at Rs. 1,000 for the first violation and Rs. 2,000 for subsequent violations. However, it was revised to Rs. 200 soon after. The CM’s order was received around 4 p.m. on Wednesday. “We stopped fining citizens soon after and only issued strict warnings,” said a marshal. According to sources in the BBMP, hand-held machines used by the marshals will have to be recalibrated as they are automated to issue receipts for Rs. 1,000. “The recalibration should be completed on Thursday,” sources said, and added that irrespective of the fine amount, there was now better awareness among people about the importance of wearing masks properly. Srinivas Alavilli from Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy said the government had to first launch targeted communication campaigns to ensure that all citizens know the importance of wearing masks. “That apart, more than the quantum of fine, it is the certainty of being fined that makes the difference,” he said and added that a bit of ‘Gandhigiri’ would also work.    Chief Minister B.S Yediyurappa has urged people to voluntarily wear masks, maintain social distancing and help the government in its efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19  ‘The Chief Minister’s order was received at 4 p.m. on Wednesday and we stopped fining citizens soon after and only issued strict warnings’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-cuts-fine-for-not-wearing-mask/article32798541.ece

As an indication of his agreeing to Mr. Panneerselvam’s principal demand for an 11-member steering committee, the Chief Minister made public the composition of the panel that would guide the organisation in all matters.  The formation of the committee was one of the points of agreement at the time of merger of groups led by Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Panneerselvam in August 2017. A resolution adopted by the general council in September 2017, too, made a mention of the committee. Those who made it to the committee were Dindigul C. Sreenivasan, R. Kamaraj, P. Thangamani, S.P.

08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||SC: public places cannot be occupied indefinitely||It was finally the gaining pandemic, which intervened like the “hand of God”, that led the protesters to relent and end the blockade, the court said. They were removed by the police from the site on March 24. The seeds of protest and dissent were sown deep during the Freedom struggle. But dissent against the colonial rule cannot be equated with dissent in a self-ruled democracy, Justice Kaul reasoned. In a democracy, the rights of free speech and peaceful protest were indeed “treasured”. They were to be encouraged and respected, the court said. Reasonable restrictions But these rights were also subject to reasonable restrictions imposed in the interest of sovereignty, integrity and public order. Police regulations also weighed in. “Fundamental rights do not live in isolation. The right of the protester has to be balanced with the right of the commuter. They have to co-exist in mutual respect.” The judgment, based on a petition filed by advocate Amit Sahni, said the Delhi High Court should have intervened positively and not left the situation fluid. The administration too should have talked to the protesters. “Unfortunately, despite a lapse of a considerable period of time, there was neither any negotiations nor any action by the administration, thus warranting our intervention,” the Supreme Court observed. The court held it was entirely the responsibility of the administration to prevent encroachments in public spaces. They should do so without waiting for courts to pass suitable orders. “The courts are not meant to give shoulder to the administration to fire their guns from,” Justice Kaul observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/public-spaces-cannot-be-occupied-says-sc/article32798551.ece

The four were produced before a local court, which sent them in judicial remand. “Further action will be taken after collection of evidence in the investigation,” said Mathura SSP Gaurav Grover. An FIR lodged against them at the Mant police station charges them under Section 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code, Sections 14 and 17 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967; Sections 65, 72 and 76 of the Information Technology Act, for promoting enmity between groups and outraging religious feelings. Section 17 of the UAPA deals with raising funds for terrorist acts. The four were taken into custody at a toll plaza in Mathura on Monday when they were travelling in a car from Delhi to Hathras, the police said. The car was stopped after the police found their activities “suspicious”. Researchers Besides Mr. Kappan, a journalist working with Malayalam portals based in Delhi, the other three were identified as Ateeq-ur-Rehman of Muzaffarnagar, Masood Ahmed of Bahraich and Alam of Rampur. While Mr. Ahmed and Rehman are research scholars, Mr. Alam was the driver of the car, said Ansar Indori, their lawyer. In the FIR, sub-inspector Prabal Singh accuses the four of carrying pamphlets reading ‘Justice for Hathras Victim’ and moving towards the district to disrupt peace as part of a “big conspiracy”. Website creation The FIR alleged that they, along with unidentified others, were linked to a crime involving the creation of an Internet platform carrd.co and website named ‘justiceforhathras’ with the motive of gathering foreign funds to trigger caste riots. The pamphlets recovered from the four, reading: ‘Am I not India’s Daughter, Made With Carrd’, could spread social discord and mass rebellion, the police said. The police, after arresting the four persons, had claimed they were linked to the Popular Front of India (PFI), an outfit blamed by the State government.  Cong. flays Yogi The Congress on Wednesday alleged that the Yogi Adityanath government has been slapping sedition charges after the Hathras gang-rape incident as if it were “pickpocketing” charges and asserted no government ever in the past has invoked sedition charges after a rape case as the Uttar Pradesh government has done. Senior party leader and Rajya Sabha MP Abhishek Singhvi said the response of the Yogi government to the Hathras incident has been ‘bizzare’ as it has been coming up with a number of conspiracy theories.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/journalist-3-others-booked-for-sedition-in-up/article32798553.ece

The turmoil ended with the Congress government winning a confidence vote in the Assembly on August 14. The FIR, registered in the Vidhayakpuri police station here, has named Lokendra Singh, who runs an independent news agency, and Sharat Kumar, State editor of a TV news channel, as the accused. Mr. Singh’s news agency also has the contract for news coverage of Sachin Pilot, who was sacked as Deputy Chief Minister during the crisis. The case has been registered on the complaint of an officer of the cybercrime police station, who said that the allegations of phone tapping were wrong and “false information” was publicised. Probe demand by BJP While the MLAs supporting Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot were shifted to a resort near Jaisalmer, the Pilot camp alleged on August 7 that the phones of some of the legislators were being tapped with the involvement of senior police officers. Though the Police denied the allegations, the BJP had demanded a probe into the episode.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fir-against-2-journalists-in-phone-tapping-case/article32798594.ece

Mr. Chennithala said the government had created a company, Overseas Keralites Investment and Forwarding Limited, as a fig leaf to cover the fraudulent giveaway of prime land at a low price to business persons. The government had only a minority stake in the company, a mere 24%. It had named one O. V. Mustapha and Baiju George Parappadu as directors, he said. Mr. Chennithala said the government had not revealed the criteria for including the businessmen as top stakeholders in the venture. The government had earmarked 2 to 4 acres of prime land for the company to develop the amenities in Alappuzha, Ernakulam, and Wayanad. The government largesse to the company also included land owned by the Steel Industries, Kerala, at Cherthala, he said. Mr. Chennithala said the government had found a roundabout way to gift public land to private developers under the guise of a public-private partnership.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/land-scam-in-the-making-alleges-chennithala/article32798879.ece

The then legislators alleged to be responsible for the destruction of public property in the House are E.P. Jayarajan, V. Sivankutty, C.K. Sadasivan, K. Kunhammed, all Communist Party of India (Marxist) members, K. Ajith of the CPI and K.T. Jaleel, an LDF Independent. The police case was that they had destroyed microphones and computers and toppled the chair of the Speaker to deter the then Finance Minister K.M. Mani from delivering the Budget speech. The LDF’s grouse was about Mani’s alleged criminal culpability in a bar bribery case. The CJM had in September turned down a plea by the government to withdraw the case.

08 October 2020||PALAKKAD,||Woman who posed for Malampuzha Yakshi passes away||The woman who had posed in front of celebrated sculptor Kanayi Kunhiraman for the making of world famous Yakshi sculpture at the Malampuzha park, near here, died on Wednesday. Nafeesa aka Nabeesumma passed away without being acknowledged for her role in the making of the Yakshi. She was in the news when Kanayi visited her at hospital last year during the golden jubilee celebrations of the Yakshi. Although the government and the Lalithakala Akademi had ignored Nafeesa and the four others who had helped the sculptor during the two years he spent sculpting it from 1967, Kanayi acknowledged her service by paying a visit to her. The model The 30-ft-tall sculpture of a nude woman in sitting position has won widespread attention and appreciation not only because of its posture, but also because of its size and figure. When Kanayi modelled the Yakshi’s upper portion, especially the bust, on the nude image of a western woman, it was Nafeesa who posed for the statue’s legs. Nafeesa’s co-workers Velayudhan and Pazhaniswami recounted how she sat with her skirt raised up to her knees. They said she never had to reveal her body. She had sat in front of the sculptor with her legs stretched out, showing her robust shanks. Nafeesa was one of the five workers assigned by the Irrigation Department to help Kanayi. Two others had died earlier.  The government had celebrated the statue’s golden jubilee by organising a 12-day Yakshi Yanam programme in February-March last year, by bringing in artists from across the country. But the neglect of those involved in the making of the iconic sculpture had evoked strong criticism.  Felicitation The Samskara Sahiti, a cultural wing of the Congress, had felicitated the workers when the government insisted that their service would not be acknowledged. “We do not have to invoke any politics or affiliation when acknowledging the services of those involved in this world class sculpture. It’s a matter of acknowledging a simple human act. Humanity has to find priority here,” said Sahiti district chairman Boban Mattumantha. Mr. Mattumantha and District Congress Committee vice president Sumesh Achuthan paid homage to Nafeesa at her house at Malampuzha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/woman-who-posed-for-yakshi-dead/article32798552.ece

08 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CMC doctors implant heart valve through jugular vein of a woman||A team of cardiologists of the Christian Medical College (CMC) Hospital, Vellore, has used a novel percutaneous route to implant a pulmonary valve in a 54-year-old woman from Puducherry. The doctors implanted the new heart valve through the jugular vein, a blood vessel in the neck. The patient had undergone open heart surgery for “Tetralogy of Fallot”, a condition in the heart that causes oxygenated blood and deoxygenated blood to mix with not enough blood reaching the lungs, when she was 9, at CMC. She had recently approached the hospital with progressive fatigue and trouble in doing her household activities. At CMC, doctors found that one of her valves in the right side of the heart — pulmonary valve — was defective and was allowing reverse flow of blood into the heart. This caused her pulmonary artery, the blood vessel that carries blood to the lungs, to enlarge significantly. If left untreated, this could lead to progressive deterioration of the heart function, according to a press release. After a detailed evaluation, the structural heart team was of the view that she needed a new valve. Considering that she had undergone an open heart surgery in the past, a repeat surgery would carry higher risks and require prolonged hospital stay. Non-surgical implant Doctors pointed out that recent technological advancements in interventional cardiology allowed for implantation of new valves non-surgically. Over the past four years, they have been following a low-cost non-surgical or percutaneous valve implantation programme. By avoiding an open-heart surgery, the percutaneous procedure helped in reducing hospitalisation time and led to quicker recovery, doctors said. For this patient, doctors used a made-in-India artificial heart tissue valve that was increasingly used in European countries such as Germany and the Netherlands. With the patient’s pulmonary artery becoming exceptionally large, the largest portion of 32 mm of artificial valve was utilised for the procedure. A team of cardiologists of cardiology unit-2 John Jose, Paul V. George and Harsha Teja — implanted the valve in the pulmonary position through the jugular vein under anaesthetic support by the cardiac anaesthetic team Raj Sahajanandan, Balaji and Kirubakaran. “We have previously done valvuloplasties through the jugular vein. In some patients, inserting the catheter through the femoral vein (in the groin) and taking it to the heart can be technically challenging due to normal anatomical angulations and distortions due to disease pathology. “In this patient, we had to take a large valve of 32 mm that required a puncture of about 8 mm in the jugular vein. This was the biggest challenge in the procedure. Concerns of using a large-size jugular access, include potential damage to vital structures in the neck, including nerves, airway, other blood vessels and lymphatic channels. We could avoid these complications by using a micro puncture under ultrasonic guidance,” Dr. Jose, professor of cardiology, said. The patient had significant improvement of her cardiac function and was discharged from the hospital. Dr. Jose recently started a cardiac valve and structural heart disease interventions clinic at CMC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cmc-doctors-implant-heart-valve-through-jugular-vein/article32799339.ece
08 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Air traffic showing signs of uptick||The Airports Authority of India (AAI) had to wait for a long time before its request for operating 100 arrival flights from other States was approved. Finally, the announcement came last week, much to its relief. But there has been a a marginal increase in the flight movements. For instance, there were only 58 arrival and 58 departure flights on Tuesday and 64 arrival and 64 departure flights on Wednesday. The AAI is hopeful that in a week’s time the numbers would touch 200 flights, both arrival and departures, sources said. One of the primary reasons for this, there has been no uptick in the demand for seats, sources said. “We don’t see tourists or the entire section of business travellers back to taking flights yet. Gradually, there are people willing to travel but it is going to take time because many of them still have apprehensions,” a source said. There has been an incremental rise in the number of passengers but it was far from pre-COVID-19 level. Right now, there are about 12,000-13,000 passengers a day travelling but early this year, the airport handled about 35,000 passengers a day with nearly 450-500 flight movements. Low occupancy Sources said, in some flights, the number of passengers is still dismal. Every day, in some flights, there are only about 15 to 20 passengers. A few days ago, in a flight to Tiruchi, there were six passengers in all. But officials of the AAI said it was up to to them to fix the schedules and logistics. “We are pushing for handling the maximum number of flights. For October 15, there are 85 arrival and 85 departure flights. So, we are hoping that this will happen in the next two or three weeks,” an official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/air-passenger-traffic-showing-signs-of-revival/article32799184.ece
08 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Guidance partners WEF to open manufacturing hub||Guidance, the Tamil Nadu government’s nodal agency for investment promotion and single window facilitation, has partnered with the World Economic Forum (WEF) to establish India’s first advanced manufacturing hub (AMHUB) in Tamil Nadu. The State will be able to harness opportunities in electronics, electric mobility, solar energy and textiles through collaboration with the AMHUB. “As an important contributor to the manufacturing sector in India, Tamil Nadu will utilise the AMHUB to adopt IoT [Internet of Things] and other emerging technologies for advanced manufacturing to sustain and create new avenues of manufacturing growth,” said Neeraj Mittal, CEO and Managing Director of Guidance. “Advanced manufacturing will boost end-to-end manufacturing of high-tech and high-value products in Tamil Nadu and will shape the future of advanced manufacturing and production,” he said. The AMHUB is one of the 19 platforms designed by the WEF. The hub will help the production ecosystem in Tamil Nadu by identifying and addressing regional opportunities brought about by the fourth industrial revolution, highlighting and amplifying regional success stories globally and engaging directly with other AMHUBs through the WEF’s network.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/guidance-partners-wef-to-open-manufacturing-hub/article32799192.ece
08 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Patient turns 80 in hospital||When Krishnan arrived at the Government COVID-19 Hospital, Guindy, he was in a critical condition, requiring oxygen support, and spent the next few days in the intensive care unit (ICU). On the path of recovery now, he turned 80 on Wednesday and celebrated his birthday with patients and doctors at the hospital. K. Narayanasamy, director of the hospital, said Mr. Krishnan was admitted on arrival to the zero-delay ward and shifted to the ICU. “He was in a critical condition. He had breathlessness and 50% lung involvement. His oxygen saturation level was very low, and he required oxygen support,” he said. As his condition stabilised, doctors shifted him to a normal ward. “I was on the regular ward rounds and inquired about his condition. He told me that his birthday was on October 7 and he was turning 80. So, we planned to celebrate his birthday in the ward,” he added. Mr. Krishnan cut a cake as other patients and hospital staff cheered for him. “He was very happy to celebrate his birthday with all the new people around him. He turned emotional. It was a reason to be happy not just for him but also for the other patients. It was a way to show that we — doctors, staff nurses and paramedical staff — are there for them,” Dr. Narayanasamy added. It was the National Institute of Ageing, Guindy, that was converted into a government COVID-19 hospital, with 750 beds, including 100 ICU beds and 300 oxygen beds. It started functioning on July 7. So far, 4,555 patients have been admitted to the hospital and 3,904 of them have been discharged. The hospital has been treating a number of elderly patients. In July, 203 persons aged over 60 were treated, while 439 persons were treated in August. As many as 551 elderly patients were admitted in September.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/patient-turns-80-in-hospital/article32798689.ece
08 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu’s borrowings touch Rs. 50,000 cr. in 2020-21||Tamil Nadu’s market borrowings have touched Rs. 50,000 crore so far in the fiscal year 2020-21, up 107% from Rs. 24,190 crore in the comparable period last year. The lockdown imposed to curb COVID-19 has led to a challenging situation for the States with lower revenue collections on the one hand and increasing expenditure on the other, forcing them to borrow through the issue of bonds, known as State development loans. Tamil Nadu has been the second highest borrower after Maharashtra, which has raised Rs. 52,500 crore, according to CARE Ratings. Tamil Nadu is followed by Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan. According to the provisional figures of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), Tamil Nadu’s fiscal deficit (the difference between total revenue and expenditure excluding borrowings) was Rs. 21,833.48 crore in 2020-21 (till July). The revenue deficit (the difference between the government’s revenue receipts and revenue expenditure) was Rs. 18,266.54 crore, as of July. A revenue deficit shows the government’s earnings are not adequate to meet its day-to-day operational expenses. According to Care Ratings, Tamil Nadu has seen its borrowing cost decline to 6.16% so far in October, from 6.19% in September 2020. The average interest rate was 7% in April. Tamil Nadu also seems to favour raising money through bonds with the tenure ranging from 10 years to 35 years, and has not utilised the short-term funding option through the Reserve Bank of India’s Ways and Means Advances facility. One of the reasons could be that in terms of bonds, the payments are phased out with a longer maturity period. In the budget for 2020-21, Tamil Nadu pegged its net borrowings at Rs. 59,209.30 crore. The Centre has increased the net borrowing limits of the State governments for 2020-21 to 5% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) from 3%. However, only 0.5% increase is unconditional and the remaining is subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. The 0.5% leeway will enable Tamil Nadu to borrow an additional Rs. 9,627 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadus-borrowings-touch-rs-50000-cr-in-2020-21/article32798694.ece
08 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Growing canine strength worries citizens||Residents in the suburbs of the city are concerned over the rising number of community dogs. They blame it on disruption in the implementation of the animal birth control programme. M. Harish, a resident of Ambattur, said there were 200 to 300 dogs on the streets of Vijayalakshmipuram and small children playing on the streets were scared to venture out of their homes because of this. He wanted the officials of the Ambattur zone of the Greater Chennai Corporation to take steps to take away these stray dogs. Social activist V. Santhanam attributed the rise in the number of community dogs to the COVID-19 lockdown. He rued that the Pallavaram Municipality had stopped the animal birth control programme. A number of animals injured in dog fights were roaming the streets with little help coming from the local authorities or any non-governmental organisations. A senior official of the Corporation said the animal birth control was being implemented at all the three centres at Pulianthope, Kannammapet and Lloyds Colony, with more than 70 to 80 dogs being rounded up daily based on complaints from citizens. He said the civic body had taken steps to control the number of community dogs even during lockdown. Vinodkumar of the Blue Cross of India said although they had closed the Outpatient ward for treating pets, an exclusive WhatsApp number had been opened for the public to reach them for rescuing and treating any wounded stray animal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/growing-canine-strength-worries-citizens/article32799180.ece

08 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Admission of 65 doctors in PG degree, diploma courses illegal, says HC||It is high time that courts stopped showing misplaced sympathy for ineligible candidates admitted to medical courses, the Madras High Court said on Wednesday while declaring as invalid the admission of 65 doctors in various postgraduate degree and diploma courses in May 2017. These candidates had now almost completed the courses and even written their final examinations on the basis of interim orders passed by the court. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh said a stern message must be sent to medical institutions which admit ineligible students through dubious methods, year after year, by taking advantage of the delay in the commencement of the counselling process and the deadline fixed by the Supreme Court for completing admissions. “Every year, this court is able to see that there is a huge delay even to start the first round of counselling... It is not known as to whether such a confusion is created for any valid reasons or it is intentionally done to help the self-financing institutions to take advantage of the last minute chaos and admit candidates on their own,” the judge said. Colleges asked to pay He also imposed a total cost of Rs. 30 lakh on Arupadai Veedu Medical College, Vinayaka Mission Medical College, Mahatma Gandhi Medical College and Research Institute, Sri Manakula Vinayakar Medical College and Hospital, Venkateswara Medical College and Hospital, and Pondicherry Institute of Medical Sciences, all in Puducherry, for having admitted the 65 doctors in the PG courses in violation of the norms. The Medical Council of India (MCI) itself had directed the six institutions to discharge all 65 candidates. However, they had approached the High Court and obtained an interim stay of the discharge orders in 2018. While granting the stay, the court had obtained an undertaking from the students that they would not claim any equity if the writ petitions were taken up for final disposal after they complete their studies. “Therefore, even though the dismissal of these writ petitions is going to cause great damage to their careers, it is something which is not totally unexpected,” the judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/admission-of-65-doctors-in-pg-degree-diploma-courses-illegal/article32799337.ece
08 October 2020||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Sagoserve applies for GI tag for Salem Sago||The Salem Starch and Sago Manufacturers Service Industrial Co-operative Society Limited, popularly known as Sagoserve, has applied for geographical indication (GI) tag for Salem Sago (Javvarisi). On behalf of the society, the application for the GI tag was filed by P. Sanjai Gandhi, IPR Attorney and nodal officer for Geographical Indication Registration of products, Government of Tamil Nadu. Chinnaraja G. Naidu, Deputy Registrar of Geographical Indications, confirmed that an application seeking GI tag for Salem Sago was filed this week. “Till date, we have registered 41 applications from Tamil Nadu and four applications have been advertised in the journal and awaiting clearance. Six more are pending for getting reply from the applicant. Recently, we received an application for Jaderi Namakatti,” he said. The Salem Sago is made from wet starch powder crushed from Tapioca roots. Around 30-35% of starch content is said to be found in the Indian Tapioca root. If GI tag is granted for this product, it will boost business for the farmers in this region and the over-400 sago and starch units in Salem, Erode, Nammakal and Dharmapuri belts, said those who have been in this business for several decades in the Salem region. The Salem district uses almost 35,000 hectares of land for the cultivation of tapioca and the yield stands at 25-30 tonnes per hectare. Sago has low calorific value (310 kcal/100g) and its size generally ranges from 2 to 4.5 mm. One kg tapioca sago can be produced from 5kg of tapioca tubers. Details furnished by Mr. Gandhi in the application show that in 1943, a person named Manickam Chettiar from Salem who was cultivating tapioca found that its flour can be used to make sago. This is how the journey of sago began. With the help of M. Venkatachalam Gounder ( a mechanic), Mr. Manickam Chettiar improvised the methods and machinery for production. The production capacity then went up from two bags of 100kg per day to 25 bags per day. The application also highlighted that sago production has contributed extensively to the development of the economy of Salem from the year 1967. Currently over 80% of sago in India is produced in the Salem region and a majority of this is marketed through Sagoserve, while the rest are through direct sales. Sago is used in various industries, including food, paper, construction, textile, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, mining, and alcohol, among others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sagoserve-applies-for-gi-tag-for-salem-sago/article32798740.ece

Palaniswami, who was nominated as the Chief Minister candidate for the 2021 Assembly poll, on Wednesday pledged to carry out a “political revolution” in the State by ensuring the third successive victory of AIADMK in the forthcoming election. In a statement addressed to party workers, Mr. Palaniswami, thanked Deputy Chief Minister-cum-party coordinator O. Panneerselvam and a host of others for proposing his candidature. He sought people’s cooperation and said “let us create a history by re-establishing the ‘golden reign’” that is currently happening in the State. Giving an elaborate account of various decisions, schemes and policy measures of his government in the last three-and-a-half years, Mr. Palaniswami sought to project himself as a “farmer” and described his government as one being run by a farmer. Asserting that his party had no place for “politics of family rule,” he said he was himself an example of how a person, through hard work, could come up the ladder, as his party had been functioning as per the advice of its founder, M.G. Ramachandran, that “only those who work hard are the best people.” The CM, who called on the Deputy Chief Minister and Assembly Speaker P. Dhanapal to receive their greetings, said the party’s “target and ambition” were directed towards the welfare of the people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chief-minister-promises-a-political-revolution/article32798700.ece
08 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tangedco drops order mandating completion certificate for certain buildings||The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) has told its field officers to effect new service connection without insisting on completion certificates for certain types of buildings. An earlier instruction issued on May 14, 2020, by the State utility said that except for residential buildings up to 12 metres in height and not exceeding three dwelling units, or 750 square metres, and all types of industrial buildings, all other building owners in the State must submit completion certificates to get electricity supply. This meant even a small commercial consumer with a 100 square feet shop cannot obtain a service connection without producing a completion certificate. The May 14 instruction had cited the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019. Similarly, an instruction issued on June 4 cited a Madras High Court order on the issue. An memo issued on October 6, 2020, by Tangedco’s Director (Distribution) instructed its field officials to follow the procedure for effecting service connections that prevailed before the issue of the instructions dated June 4 and May 14, which mandated producing completion certificates by small commercial and other consumers in the State. Moving back to the old procedure would help new consumers get power supply without submitting a completion certificate. K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary, Coimbatore Consumer Cause, has written to the Tangedco chairman on the new instruction, alleging that it may be in contrary to the orders of the High Court. “We strongly oppose and condemn the action of the Tangedco for unilaterally taking such decisions,” he said. P. Muthusamy, former Director (Engineering), Tamil Nadu, pointed out that the shortcomings in the order has led to difficulties for small consumers, which forced Tangedco to withdraw its earlier instructions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tangedco-drops-order-mandating-completion-certificate-for-certain-buildings/article32799338.ece

Stalin on Wednesday condemned the Centre for not including Tamil in the list of languages for admissions to PG-diploma in Archaeology courses. “Sanskrit, Pali, Prakritam and Arabic languages have been accepted as qualifying languages but Tamil has been ignored. This is an attempt by the Central government to impose its cultural leanings on Tamil people. Everyone should raise their voice against this move that seeks to undermine the multi-cultural identity of the country,” Mr. Stalin said. He said that for the past 10 years in Tamil Nadu, citizens of the State have been denied jobs in Railways and the Electricity departments, the Cordite factory in Ooty, and these jobs have been given to north Indians. “Even judges have expressed their dissatisfaction with this skewed recruitment and have asked how north Indian candidates, who could not even pass in Hindi itself, were getting high marks in Tamil in exams conducted by these departments,” he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-slams-centre-for-not-including-tamil-in-archaeology-admissions/article32798695.ece
08 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC orders crackdown on packaged water units||The Madras High Court on Wednesday directed the State government to crack down on all illegal packaged drinking water units across the State. It wanted criminal cases to be booked against those who were tapping groundwater and exploiting it commercially without obtaining no objection certificates (NoCs) from the officials concerned. Justices Vineet Kothari and M.S. Ramesh also directed the government to take a policy decision, within four weeks, on levying appropriate charges on such commercial units for the extraction of groundwater. They directed Special Government Pleader (SGP) J. Pothiraj to ascertain the government’s decision in this regard by November 19. Earlier, the Bench recorded the SGP’s statement that the survey of groundwater level across the State was being taken once in three years and that those areas were classified as safe, semi-critical, critical and over-exploited on the basis of their groundwater level. NoCs were issued on the basis of such classifications. Since the last survey was done in 2017, the government authorities had begun a resurvey this year and had already completed assessing the over-exploited areas. The resurvey of safe, semi-critical and critical areas would be completed by March 2021, and thereafter NoCs would be issued, the SGP said. The submission was made when the counsel, representing some packaged drinking water units, complained that the denial of NoCs on the basis of the 2017 survey was not right.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-orders-crackdown-on-packaged-water-units/article32799186.ece
08 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CM candidate issue: what AIADMK leaders say||The AIADMK, by declaring the 66-year-old Edappadi K. Palaniswami as its Chief Ministerial candidate for the 2021 Assembly election, is the latest to join the recent trend of major political parties announcing their CM candidates well ahead of polling. It has to change its tack in view of the prevailing situation, according to many leaders of the party. The party, when headed by its founder M.G. Ramachandran and his successor Jayalalithaa, did not formally promote them as its nominees for the CM post between 1977 and 2016. Seeking to explain the difference between then and now, K.P. Munusamy, a party veteran and AIADMK deputy coordinator, says Mr. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister-coordinator of the party O. Panneerselvam, who are at the helm of the party, came from within the ranks. “They have reached the present position, thanks to the guidance and support of Amma [Jayalalithaa]. It is but natural that we, in the party, have to declare Mr. Palaniswami our nominee so that there is no confusion among the party workers.” He added that while MGR, being the founder of the party, had got the place of primacy, Jayalalithaa had taken charge of the party at the time of a crisis and carried forward the organisation successfully. Natural choice Dindigul C. Sreenivasan, Minister for Forest and one of the organising secretaries, said Mr. Palaniswami, a four-time legislator and one-time Member of Parliament, had been providing “good governance” in the last three and a half years. “It is but natural that he is projected as the CM candidate.” The Minister parried the question on the Sasikala factor influencing the party’s announcement. “We have nothing to do with her” was his cryptic answer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-candidate-issue-what-aiadmk-leaders-say/article32798699.ece

08 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC poser on arrear exams’ cancellation||The Madras High Court on Wednesday wondered how students of arts, science, engineering and postgraduate computer application courses could be expected to clear their arrears without writing examinations, when an expert body such as the All-India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) had opposed such a move by the State government. Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha said they would not hesitate to call for details such as the number of arrears that each student had in their course of study. The judges were surprised over a government order (G.O.) issued on August 26, cancelling all arrear examinations citing the COVID-19 situation. The observations were made during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition filed by E. Balagurusamy, 75, former vice-chancellor of Anna University, through his counsel E. Vijay Anand, as well as another PIL petition filed by advocate B. Ramkumar Adityan to declare the August 26 G.O. illegal and arbitrary. In his affidavit, Mr. Balagurusamy had said that he had chosen to file the PIL petition to save the quality of education, the future of students and the reputation of various universities in the State. The AICTE has already filed its response to the PIL petition and told the court that the government’s decision to cancel arrears was not in accordance with its guidelines. On Wednesday, advocate V. Sudha, representing the UGC, sought two weeks’ time to file a counter affidavit. Accepting her plea, the judges adjourned the cases to November 20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-poser-on-arrear-exams-cancellation/article32798687.ece

Radhakrishnan on Wednesday claimed that the party’s alliance with the AIADMK was for the Lok Sabha polls and it would take a decision on an alliance for the upcoming Assembly elections next year that could include going with “either the AIADMK or the DMK”. Mr. Radhakrishnan said the BJP’s alliance for the Assembly polls “could be with the AIADMK. Or it could be with the DMK, or we can form an alliance on our own. There is a possibility for everything”. However, DMK treasurer T.R. Baalu told The Hindu that there was no such possibility. “The DMK’s alliance decision has to be taken only by the DMK president, M.K. Stalin, not by some Tom, Dick and Harry (sic),” he said. Another senior leader in the DMK ruled out any alliance with the BJP. “Definitely not,” the leader shot back when asked if the party was considering any such alliance with the BJP. DMK leaders said Mr. Radhakrishnan was possibly trying to cause confusion in the opposition ranks with such statements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-dmk-tie-up-possible-pon-radhakrishnan/article32799189.ece
08 October 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Corporation fixes fortnightly, monthly targets for contractors||In an effort aimed at expediting the progress of projects taken up under the Smart Cities Mission, the Coimbatore Corporation has fixed fortnightly and monthly targets for contractors. Corporation Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian held a meeting a couple of days ago with engineers, project management consultants and contractors to review the progress in model road, lake development, multi-level car parking and other Smart Cities Mission works. At the meeting, he asked the contractors to divide the projects into small components to fix targets for each of those components and fortnightly and monthly targets and stick to those to complete the project in time, said Deputy Commissioner S. Madhuranthagi. Sources that participated in the Monday’s review meeting said the Commissioner had asked the contractors to complete the model road work, taken up on D.B. Road, R.S. Puram, by December 2020. Likewise, he had asked the contractor executing the multi-level car parking project, again on D.B. Road, by January 2021. Though the contractor had asked for time till June 2021, the Commissioner said it would be better if the revised deadline was January 2021, the sources said. Beautification of lakes As for the timeline for projects taken up to beautify and rejuvenate the lakes in the city, the Corporation wanted the contractor to complete the projects taken up at Valangulam, Ukkadam Big Tank (Periyakulam) and Selva Chinthamanai tanks December 2020. The sources said that the Corporation stuck to the deadline though the contractor had asked for an extension by a month or two considering the North-East Monsoon, the sources said. The Corporation had revised deadline very much keeping in mind the impact of COVID-19 lockdown and the impact of monsoon on the tank work. Nevertheless, the Corporation stuck to the deadline because it had floated the tender more than two years ago and wanted the works complete to showcase them to the public.  As for the deadline for model road project on Race Course and lake development project on Kurichi tank, there was no change as the Corporation had floated tenders only less than six months ago, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-fixes-fortnightly-monthly-targets-for-contractors/article32799195.ece

R. Mohammed Saleem of Environment Conservation Group said that the adult eagle was found near a warehouse at Ponnaiyarajapuram. “Residents found the bird in bushes and it struggled to fly. They initially thought it was an owl. When reached the spot, I was surprised that it was a Crested Serpent Eagle as it normally prefers forested habitats” Mr. Saleem said. According to him, the eagle did not have any external injury but it was not able to fly. “As the eagle could be attacked by stray dogs, I took the bird with me. The Forest Department will be informed about the rescue and further arrangements will be made for its care,” he said.

08 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Madurai Corporation yet to set up smart city advisory forum: MP||Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan on Wednesday expressed anguish over Madurai Corporation’s failure to constitute the Smart City Advisory Forum (SCAF) comprising elected representatives as per Smart City Mission Guidelines. “The local body has taken up several important works to make one of the oldest cities a smart city with additional facilities at a massive cost of Rs. 2,000 crore. But a few officials have been taking the calls on project design to execution without following the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs guidelines on the mission,” Mr. Venkatesan told The Hindu . He wondered why the local body chose not to involve the elected representatives such as the MP and MLAs in the projects. “In the absence of the corporation council, as the urban local body election could not be conducted, the presence of SCAF and convening of periodical meetings with elected representatives would have helped in better planning and execution of the projects,” he pointed out. Under the guidelines, Madurai Collector would have been the Chairman of SCAF with the MP as Co-Chairman. The six MLAs, whose constituencies were in the city limits, and the Corporation Commissioner and City Engineer would have been members. When the DISHA meeting, chaired by Madurai MP, was convened on September 7 to discuss the smart city projects under implementation, Corporation officials feigned ignorance about the need to constitute SCAF. “Both the Commissioner and City Engineer said they were unaware of this aspect,” Mr. Venkatesan said. However, subsequently, he accessed through MoHUA the reminder letter sent to State governments and Chief Executive Officer of all smart cities to convene SCAF meetings. Reminder letter The letter, dated December 26, 2019, sought compliance report on the SCAF meeting. The reminder was a direct fallout of a number of MPs of the Parliamentary Standing Committee for MoHUA complaining that the SCAF meetings were not conducted by many smart cities. “The Ministry had asked the smart cities to convene at least one meeting by January 15. But officials of Madurai Corporation have conveniently given it a miss,” he said. In his response, Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan said the city held time-to-time consultation with stakeholders on plan and progress of projects. “We will shortly convene the SCAF meeting that could not be conducted due to COVID-19 pandemic,” the civic body chief added. Complaining about lack of transparency in the detailed project report on implementation of proposals, Mr. Venkatesan said though 45% of local residents gave priority to improvement in city traffic and transport facilities, the authorities chose different projects. “The decision to increase the number of shops and space for vehicle parking at Periyar bus stand by three-fold without enhancing traffic facilities is only going to make the city more congested. There is nothing smart about it,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/madurai-corporation-yet-to-set-up-smart-city-advisory-forum-mp/article32799277.ece

08 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Actual farmers not getting any benefits: High Court||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday took a serious view of the PM Kisan Scheme scam, in which money was fraudulently credited to thousands of ineligible people. The court put forth a series of questions for both the Centre and the State and observed that the benefits were not reaching the actual farmers. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi observed that agriculturalists had become orphans and in spite of various schemes floated for their benefit, they were not empowered. Agriculture sector was the only sector where the producer had no say in fixing the price of the produce, the court said. The judges ordered notices to the Ministry of Agriculture and the Tamil Nadu Department of Agriculture and sought response to a series of queries. The court asked the Centre and the State to submit in the next hearing the number and the names of schemes floated for the benefit of farmers in the last 10 years and whether the benefits were reaching the farmers. It also sought to know how much the governments had spent on such schemes including the PM Kisan scheme, how much was the subsidy under each scheme and if there were any mechanism to monitor the intended reach of the schemes. It asked whether the malpractices committed were detected and cases filed against corrupt officials. Further, with regard to the PM Kisan Scheme scam, the court asked what the actual position was now and how many cases were registered against those involved in the scam. The court was hearing a public interest litigation petition filed by A. Sivaperumal from Nallamanarkottai in Dindigul district, who complained that ineligible people were enrolled under the scheme. The court adjourned the hearing in the case till October 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/actual-farmers-not-getting-any-benefits-says-high-court/article32798704.ece
08 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Train services on Pamban bridge suspended||Even as a team of experts from IIT-Chennai are involved in investigating the ‘strain’ on structural member of Pamban rail bridge, Southern Railway has short-terminated Chennai-Rameswaram special train at Mandapam as a precautionary measure. “Since the continuous health monitoring system revealed a major strain on the member of the bridge, we are not allowing any passenger trains on it,” a senior railway official said. The sensors installed on the century-old steel bridge by IIT-Chennai raised an alarm after the first train — on resumption of train services after lockdown — crossed the bridge on Friday. Consequently, the empty rake of the train was run on the structure from Rameswaram to Mandapam. Passengers were ferried through special bus services to Mandapam. “The inspection is under way and the actual problem is being ascertained. Only after trials and ensuring the stability of the bridge, we will advise on running of trains on the bridge,” the official added. “Till [today] Wednesday morning, we operated special buses to ferry passengers from Mandapam to Rameswaram. However, since the train service have been cancelled between Mandapam and Rameswaram, buses will not be operated by us anymore,” an official said. Passengers have to make their own transport arrangements between Mandapam and Rameswaram. “The difference of fare would be given to passengers.

Three police personnel identified in each police station will undergo five-day training. “CD file writing assumes lot of significance when it comes to fetching conviction to the accused in cases. Often inadvertent mistakes in entering finer details of a criminal case result in acquittal of the accused,” Superintendent of Police Sujit Kumar, said after inaugurating the training programme on Wednesday. Though the cases are investigated by officials in the rank of sub-inspector and above, the role of CD file writing police personnel is significant. “They need to take a lot of caution in making entries to ensure that not even minor case details are missed,” he pointed out. Officials have roped in resource persons who will provide them case details where mistakes in CD file writing led to acquittal. “This will help the police personnel understand the gravity of CD file writing. Besides classroom teaching, the trainees will be given practical tests on writing CD files,” the SP added. Additional Superintendent of Police Vanitha and Deputy Superintendent of Police (Armed Reserve) Joseph Nixon were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/training-programme-for-police-personnel-on-cd-file-writing/article32798705.ece

A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi ordered notices in the petition filed by K. Pushpavanam of Madurai who said that a full-fledged forensic lab was needed in the State to examine and identify evidence in order to tackle crimes against wildlife. As of now the State government was sending the samples to Wildlife Institute of India in Dehradun, an autonomous institution under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, and the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad. The process consumes a lot of time and affects prosecution in wildlife crimes, ultimately resulting in low conviction rate. Therefore, a wildlife forensic laboratory should be set up in Madurai or in any other district in the Tamil Nadu, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/set-up-wildlife-forensic-laboratory-in-madurai/article32799271.ece

A.C. Arun, consultant gastroenterologist at the hospital, said the patient approached the hospital as she was suffering from jaundice and abdominal pain. It was found that a stone was formed in her bile duct, which was the reason for her jaundice. It was also found that she was COVID-19 positive. “So, we performed an advanced endoscopy procedure to place a stent inside her pile duct and she recovered from jaundice. The procedure was successfully performed even when the patient was COVID-19 positive,” said Dr. Arun. N. Sudhan, consultant gastroenterologist, and Ramanarayanan, anaesthesiologist, were part of the team that performed the procedure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-patient-undergoes-endoscopy/article32799274.ece
08 October 2020||Nagercoil,TAMIL NADU||COVID-19 deals a severe blow to Thovalai garland-maker||M.T. Vanithasree, an expert in making manikka malai (a special garland of flowers), is one of the craftsmen who showcased their talent to Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Mamallapuram. She, along with her family, also went to Mumbai to decorate the puja room of industrialist Mukesh Ambani on the occasion of his daughter’s wedding. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has dealt her trade a severe blow. “The flower market in my village Thovalai, a flower hub, was closed because of the lockdown. There is a sudden shortage of flowers. The earnings from all the weddings and temples festivals in the Tamil month of Panguni , Chithirai and Vaikasi , which would be enough for us to sail through a year, were cancelled. What sustained us was the free rice and the financial assistance from the government,” said Ms. Vanithasree, who is an engineer by training and teaches at a local engineering college. Ms. Vanithasree belongs to a family of garland-makers specialising in the art of manikka malai at Thovalai in Kanniyakumari district. The entire village is involved in the trade of flower and garland-making, but not all can make manikka malai . Her father Muthamperumal is a State government award winner and grandfather L. Madasamy Pandaram won the national award from the Union Ministry of Textiles in 1988. Her family daily sends a manikka malai for the decoration of the ‘utsavar’ (the processional deity) of the Padmanabhaswamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram. “The work ensured a regular income. But the suspension of transport from Tamil Nadu and Kerala made it impossible for us to send garlands. This affected our income. We resumed it only a month ago,” said Ms. Vanithasree, a fifth generation artiste. She said that in Mamallapuram, the schedule for the Prime Minister and the Chinese President was to meet artisans from Thanjavur. “However, both of them turned towards me as soon as they entered the venue. Probably the scent and beauty of flowers and garlands would have attracted them. Mr. Modi explained the importance of flowers in our culture, and that was what I could understand from my little knowledge of Hindi,” she recalled. She said manikka malai is made of oleander flowers and the leaves of notchi , a plant known for its medicinal value. “We use rose petals for making garlands for weddings. For temples, we will use oleander and notchi ,” said Ms. Vanithasree, whose family, including her daughter and son, visited Rajasthan to demonstrate their skills at the World Association of Floral Art in February. The making of manikka malai is a skilful art as it involves making separate strands before weaving them together to give a wholesome appearance. “We use the thread of the grass that is used to make carpets. An expert like my father can complete a one-and-a-half-foot -long garland in three hours. It will take four hours for others in the family to finish it,” said Ms. Vanithasree, who has trained her daughter Dharani and son Muthu in the art.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-deals-a-severe-blow-to-thovalai-garland-maker/article32798693.ece
08 October 2020||NAGERCOIL,TAMIL NADU||Doctors save the life of a 76-year-old patient||With the experience gained in treating COVID-19 patients and a well-equipped intensive respiratory care unit, doctors at Kanniyakumari Government Medical College Hospital at Asaripallam here have saved the life of a 76-year-old woman who was taking treatment for the infection for 53 days. When the woman from Muttom, a coastal hamlet, was brought to the hospital, investigations conducted on her showed that she had 95% lung involvement. Though her relatives lost hope that she would recover from the viral infection, the doctors took it as a challenge and started the treatment.  Round-the-clock care “A team of doctors - Edward Johnson, Head, Department of Anaesthesiology; his colleagues Selvakumar Kingsley and Muthushenbagam; Prince Pious of Department of Medicine; physician John Christopher, nephrologist Padmakumar; and pulmonologist Joseph Paratheeban - took care of the patient round-the-clock and saved her after 53 days of treatment. Despite her age and ailment, the doctors saved her,” said Dean Suganthi. This team also saved the life of a 33-year-old man from Maruthancode, who was admitted with 90% lung involvement. “The modern equipment at the intensive respiratory care unit also helped in the recovery of the two patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Both the cases were real challenge for our doctors,” the Dean said. Haemodialysis The Dean said 116 COVID-19 patients underwent haemodialysis in the special dialysis unit attached to the Intensive Respiratory Care Unit. “Apart from patients from Kanniyakumari and Tirunelveli districts, we are getting a good number of patients from Kerala. We’ve successfully treated a few MLAs also,” said Medical Superintendent Arul Prakash. Former MLA of Radhapuram M. Appavu, who underwent treatment for COVID-19, said the doctors were doing an excellent job to save patients with viral infection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/doctors-save-the-life-of-a-76-year-old-patient/article32798719.ece
08 October 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Two grade separators proposed in Puducherry||Inaugurating the one-km-long road overbridge at Arumparthapuram railway gate through video-conferencing on Wednesday, Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari announced a slew of road infrastructure projects, including grade separators at Rajiv Gandhi and Indira Gandhi signals. The Ministry was in the process of preparing a detailed project report to construct a grade separator at Rajiv Gandhi square at a cost of Rs. 298 crore and another one at Indira Gandhi square at Rs. 196 crore, the Minister said. The Ministry would take up construction of a foot overbridge at Nonankuppam boat house at a cost of Rs. 5 crore. It had also decided to lay a four-lane on the stretch from Ariyur to Indira Gandhi square. The four-laning would facilitate construction of a new bridge across Sankaraparani river, the Minister said. Many road improvement works would be taken up in Puducherry, Karaikal and Mahe regions, the Minister said. The Ministry would also extend assistance if private players came forward to launch ferry service using amphibious seaplanes. Like airports, the country should develop water ports, Mr. Gadkari said. “The territorial administration should initiate steps in this direction and the Ministry will extend assistance,” he added. Mr. Gadkari, who also holds the portfolio of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, said two tool room centres had been built in Puducherry and they would be inaugurated soon. The bridge had been built at a cost of Rs. 35 crore to regulate traffic congestion on the Puducherry-Villupuram stretch. Avoid delay: L-G Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi on Wednesday urged the Centre to provide project management training to all those involved in planning projects to avoid delays in execution. Participating in the inaugural of the bridge, the Lt. Governor said the construction of the bridge got delayed for seven years owing to several reasons. “Due to this it had several over runs which cost the government additional money, besides huge litigation and land compensation fee,” she said. Requesting the Centre to factor in additional costs in anticipation as a contingency fund to avoid delays, the L-G said the government should ensure project management training as refresher programme to all those involved. It would also help in updating their skills, she added. Ms. Bedi also stressed the need for transparency in progress and accounting. ‘Speed up project’ Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy requested Mr. Gadkari to speed up implementation of new road project linking Villupuram, Puducherry, Karaikal and Nagapattinam. The Chief Minister said the new road project costing Rs. 800 crore was very important for the Union Territory. Explaining the importance of the project, he said the railway gate at Arumparthapuram used to be closed 18 times a day. Commuters faced severe hardship due to closure of the gate, he said and added that the project was sanctioned in 2013 when the UPA was in power. “After the BJP came to power, some forces tried to stall the project but Mr. Gadkari intervened and facilitated its speedy implementation,” he said. He said preparatory works for capital dredging at the port had already commenced. The Ministry of Shipping had included the port under the Sagarmala scheme and sanctioned Rs. 50 crore for the capital dredging, Mr. Narayanasamy added. Minister for Public Works A. Namassivayam in his address said it was a dream project of the government. “We faced several obstacles in fulfilling the scheme but overcame all those issues with determination,” he added. Minister for Power R. Kamalakannan, Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) N. Gokulakrishnan and Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) V. Vaithilingam and Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar also attended the inaugural.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-grade-separators-proposed-in-puducherry/article32799348.ece
08 October 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||490 new cases, two deaths in U.T.||Puducherry logged 490 new cases on Wednesday taking its overall tally of COVID-19 cases past the 30,000-mark. The Union Territory also recorded two deaths raising the toll to 551. The capital accounted for both fatalities. The test positivity rate was 9.43%, case fatality rate 1.87% and recovery rate 82.66%. The tally stood at 551 deaths, 4,680 active cases, a cumulative total of 30,161 cases and 24,930 recovered patients. S. Mohan Kumar, Director of Health said apart from two people belonging to Puducherry who died in the last 24 hours, three patients from Mahe region, who died in neighbouring Kerala, were transferred to Puducherry. The new cases were identified after examination of 5,195 samples during the last 24 hours, while in the same period 316 patients were discharged. Puducherry accounted for 355 new cases, Karaikal 65, Yanam 13 and Mahe 57. The active cases aggregate to 4,680, including 3,044 patients in home quarantine. The health department has so far undertaken tests of 2.15 lakh samples, of which results of 1.81 lakh samples were negative. Health Minister Malladi Krishna Rao said for the past week, the number of samples tested was averaging about 4,500 per day. Based on the Government of India guidelines following the near-total unlocking of the economy, the focus of the testing strategy had been changed to identify symptomatic patients in high-incidence areas early. Door-to-door visits Teams of ASHA/ANMs have been undertaking door-to-door visits to screen for symptoms and to refer patients to hospital promptly to bring down fatalities, he said. Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi called for streamlining the deployment of health manpower in COVID-19 management to ensure optimal engagement in the field. The Health Director has been asked to provide the deployment chart of medical officers. “The challenge now is how the health department can become more and more self reliant with the education department opening up and others returning to their respective work,” Ms. Bedi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/490-new-cases-two-deaths-in-ut/article32799342.ece

08 October 2020||Special Correspondent,TAMIL NADU||POS machines given to ration shops in Ramanathapuram||From now on, all the 775 ration shops in the district would issue essential commodities only after checking the biometric details of the consumer and all the 3.69 lakh family card holders would get the purchase details in their registered mobile numbers soon after the sale was effected from the PoS (point of sale) machine. Speaking to reporters, Collector K Veera Raghava Rao said here on Wednesday that already about 190 PDS outlets had the machines. After updating them, the remaining ration shops too were issued with the newly upgraded finger biometric machines. The objective was to prevent malpractice and impersonation, he responded to a query. District Supply Office had given training to the salesmen on how to handle the gadgets. From now on, the card holders shall visit the authorised PDS outlets with the ration card. After getting the essential commodities, the salesman would get their finger biometric details. It is not necessary that the head of the family mentioned in the card should go, but any one member (whose name reflected in the card) can procure the commodities after the the biometric fingerprint check. If the card holder could not go to the PDS outlet due to sickness, an authorised person may go on his/her behalf. In such cases, the card holder may have to give his mobile phone as it would get a OTP. It will be required for the transaction. Similarly, in the event of ration card missing, the consumer can carry his/her Adhaar card. Based on the identity, the registered mobile would receive a OTP (one time password), which shall be recorded. This was to ensure that the essential commodities had been given only to the authorised card holder, Mr. Rao said. He hoped the new facility would put an end to the complaints of pilferage and other malpractices or impersonation. The district has 3.69 lakh cards and about 12.50 lakh members should get the correct quantity as well. An official in the office of the DSO said the biometric machines was yet another step towards transparent administration. District Revenue Officer A Sivakami, DSO Christopher Jayaraj and Deputy Registrar (PDS) Rajavelan participated. The Collector distributed the biometric machines to the salesmen at the Collectorate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pos-machines-given-to-ration-shops-in-ramanathapuram/article32798721.ece

Officials and traders, who were allotted shops, visited the market, designed to serve people for at least 25 years. Some traders moved their equipment such as refrigerators, weigh machines and ice boxes from the Puthur fish market, which is to be demolished to pave the way for construction of a shopping complex in a few days. Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian said all traders, who had permanent shops at the Puthur market, had been allotted shops at the new market. Some of them had begun trade. A few others were in the process of moving. Full fledged activities would begin in a day or two.

It joins Andal, who is 42 and has been at the temple for over 30 years. Joint Commissioner P. Jayaraman said it was supposed to reach the temple even before the lockdown was imposed. Lakshmi Mills in Coimbatore has donated it to the temple. It was accepted because of number of temple activities. It arrived in Srirangam on Wednesday afternoon from Coimbatore. The temple authorities began preparations for an additional shed, next to Andal’s, nearly a year ago. “Her shed is the same as Andal’s and was constructed specially to accommodate her,” an official said. The elephant will undergo training at the temple premises for at least six months before she joins Andal in temple events. “Even though she is domesticated, she needs to get accustomed to the temple premises, her trainers and her role in the temple.” When Premi is ready, a schedule will be drawn up so that Andal and she take over temple duties on alternate days. “This will give them rest and allow rituals and other events to run smoothly,” he said. Until she is ready to take on her newly assigned duties, Premi will be on a diet of rice, cane jaggery and grass.

08 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||No defect in strike notice: employees||Asserting that their decision to go on indefinite strike from 6 a.m. on October 10 against corporatisation of Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) was arrived at after exhausting all the avenues for redressal of grievances, the federations of employee associations of defence production units have taken exception to what they described as ‘unfounded allegation’ of defects in the strike notice levelled by the Department of Defence Production (DDP). In a representation to the Secretary of Defence Production on Wednesday, the All India Defence Employees’ Federation, Indian National Defence Workers Federation and Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh, regretted that the government was stifling the voice of workers without any concern for their security of job, existence of the ordnance factories and defence preparedness of the nation. Raising questions about performance of Ordnance Factory Board was tantamount to revealing defence secrets at the cost of demoralising soldiers, C. Srikumar, General Secretary, AIDEF; R.Srinivasan, General Secretary, INDWF; and Mukesh Singh, General Secretary, BPMS, said in the letter, copies of which were also addressed, among others, to the Secretary, Ministry of Defence, and the Chief Labour Commissioner, Ministry of Labour and Employment. The federations maintained that they had issued the strike notice in the prescribed format, invoking the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act. Though the workmen are in public utility service, they still have the right to strike under the Industrial Disputes Act, the letter said. Once the OFB becomes a corporation or multiple corporations, the employees will not get salary and other benefits from the consolidated fund of India/ Defence service estimates. The statement made by the MoD in its letter dated October 1, that we are relying on assumptions and apprehensions are not tenable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-defect-in-strike-notice-employees/article32798698.ece

08 October 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||‘Government trying to bury facts behind Hathras murder’||Condemning the alleged rape and murder of a 19-year-old dalit girl in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras, members of Aathi Thamizhar Peravai staged a demonstration in front of the Collectorate on Wednesday. Addressing the protestors, Padma Kalaikannan, deputy secretary of the forum’s Tirunelveli district women’s wing, said that when the entire nation had been rocked by the gruesome rape and murder of the girl, the government was working overtime to bury the facts behind this heinous crime, besides coercing and barring politicians and the journalists from meeting the family members of the victim. The pre-planned attack unleashed by the police on Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi when they were on their way to meet the family could be neither forgotten nor pardoned. “The circumstances that led to the commission of the crime and the ongoing developments associated with the rape and murder of the girl clearly show that there is no safety for people from the oppressed communities, especially for women, in the country. The police officers who manhandled Mr. Gandhi and misbehaved with Ms. Priyanka should be removed from service while handing over the investigation of the case to the CBI. The cases foisted against those who were protesting against the rape and murder of the girl should be withdrawn unconditionally, said the protestors who offered bangles to one of the protestors wearing the mask of Yogi Adityanath. National Women’s Front members also staged a demonstration at Melapalayam condemning the rape and murder. Led by its district president N. Jannathul Firdous, they raised slogans against Mr. Yogi Adityanath and the highhandedness of the police against political leaders and the media who were working to bring to light the truth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/government-trying-to-bury-facts-behind-hathras-murder/article32798709.ece
08 October 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Hoteliers urged to serve hygienically-prepared food||Owners of eateries – right from leading restaurants to roadside eateries – should serve quality food prepared in a hygienic manner with quality ingredients to the customers, Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish has said. Formally inaugurating the ‘Eat Right Challenge’ programme here on Wednesday, Ms. Shilpa said a balanced diet, the firm foundation for leading a disease-free living, should be ensured to every customer. Though the hoteliers were aware that cooking oil being used repeatedly for preparing food would cause health issues to the consumers, a section of them, with profit as the only motive, was serving substandard food prepared with oil already used for frying food. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India recently launched the ‘Eat Right Challenge’ competition in 197 districts and 150 cities across the country to create awareness among consumers of food safety. The objective is to improve public health through right choice of food to fight lifestyle diseases. As more than 60% of the deaths in the country are attributed to lifestyle-related non-communicable diseases, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched this programme. The Collector also inaugurated a special training programme for roadside eatery owners on preparing and serving quality food and gave them uniforms sponsored by a private firm. Since a special camp for registration of roadside eateries and issue of licence was organised as part of this event, Ms. Shilpa handed over permits to two applicants. Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital Dean M. Ravichandran, Vice-principal Shantharaman, District Designated Officer for Food Safety Jagadish Chandrabose and Food Safety Officer A.R. Sankaralingam were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/serve-hygienically-prepared-food/article32798724.ece

To date, more than 480 patients have been treated. Around 430 have tested negative and have been discharged. “During their time at the centre, we wanted to keep the patients engaged so that they do not think about the infection. We already have a television and 24-hour music, but we wanted something to keep them occupied and at the same time, educate them,” said V. Vikram Kumar, government Siddha doctor and coordinator for the Siddha COVID-19 care centre. Based on instructions from the Tirupathur Collector, M.P. Sivanarul, a herbal garden was started. “We have 50 varieties of herbal plants, including karpooravalli , tulsi , hibiscus, thumbai , thuthuvalai , papaya and adathodai . Their uses are stated on a board beside the plants,” he added. Every morning and evening, patients water the plants. “We wanted to improve their confidence and motivate them. Books are the best medium for that. So we also started a small library with a few hundred books,” Dr. Kumar said. The library comprises works by Tamil authors and books on Siddha medicine and the environment. “People have learnt new things and many have picked up a reading habit now,” he added. Apart from this, the patients perform yoga and light exercises every day. “Food is provided in mud pots,” he said.

According to the police, the three were identified as Devi, 18, her husband Sethupathi, 23, and her younger sister Saranya, 12. The three, along with the mother of the sisters, visited a temple near the canal to celebrate the girl’s 12th birthday on Tuesday afternoon. After the temple visit, Sethupathi decided to take a dip in the canal as the other three were waiting nearby. However, the girl accidentally fell into the canal and was washed away. This prompted her elder sister and the husband to follow her but they were also washed away in the water’s current, the police said. Upon receiving information, the Kamanaickenpalayam police and personnel from Palladam Fire and Rescue Station reached the spot. Palladam Deputy Superintendent of Police K.C. Ramachandren visited the spot too, and fire service personnel commenced search operations. An official from the Palladam Fire Station said that the body of Devi was retrieved on Wednesday afternoon.

According to the police, a 25-year-old man of Kothanthavadi village in Tiruvannamalai district, married a 16-year-old girl at a temple a few weeks ago. The childline (ph: 1098) staff in the district came to know about this and alerted the police. The police rushed to the village, conducted an inquiry and confirmed that the girl was a minor and it was a case of child marriage. A case was booked under POCSO Act and Prashant, his parents and the girl’s parents were arrested. Further investigation is on. Sources from the Social Welfare Department said that from January to September this year, 182 child marriages were stopped in the district alone. “During COVID-19 pandemic, we managed to stop many child marriages. Parents want to get their daughters married and are not aware of the domestic violence the girls will endure later. During every rescue, we tell the parents about the problems their daughter and they will encounter, but it always falls on deaf ears,” said an official. The Social Welfare Department in Tiruvannamalai handles child marriage and domestic violence cases in 18 blocks in the district. “We hire vehicles to reach the villages. It would be helpful if the government provides us our own vehicle. We would just need two,” the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/minor-rescued-from-marriage/article32799340.ece

However, no formal announcement was made as the election model code of conduct is in place. Bypolls are scheduled in two Assembly constituencies – Rajarajeshwarinagar in Bengaluru and Sira in Tumakuru – on November 3. According to sources, the proposed existing four corridors have been retained, but the estimated cost for the project had changed. Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises (K-RIDE), the agency which is executing the project, will float the tender once a formal announcement is made, sources added. While briefing the media after the Cabinet meeting, Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said that they could not give any information on the issue as the model code of conduct was in place in the city. However, he announced that the Union cabinet on Wednesday had given its approval for the revised cost for the Kolkata East-West Metro Corridor project. The Bengaluru suburban rail project involves building four corridors connecting different parts of the city: KSR Bengaluru-Devanahalli, Baiyappanahalli-Chikkabanavara, Kengeri-Cantonment-Whitefield, and Heelalige-Rajanakunte. Citizens and activists have carried out a series of campaigns for years to keep up pressure on governments to clear the project, which been mentioned in multiple Union budgets, including in 2019-20 and 2020-21. Fund allocation However, a token amount of only Rs. 1 crore was allocated, as per the ‘Pink Book’ brought out by the Railways on Work, Machinery and Rolling Stock Programme of Railways for 2020-21, much to the disappointment of citizens of the city. In the Union Budget 2020-21, the Centre announced that it would provide 20% of equity and facilitate external assistance up to 60% of the project cost, which was estimated at Rs. 18,600 crore. The project had been cleared by the Extended Railway Board (ERB) in November 2019. Transport expert Sanjeev Dyamannavar of the advocacy group Praja said that now the focus should be on execution of the project as everything for start of the project was in place. “K-RIDE is executing the project, the DPR is ready and there will not be any major issue with land acquisition as a major portion of the land for the project is with the Railways. Now, both the State and Union governments should allocate funds so that the project is implemented soon,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/centre-clears-suburban-rail-project-for-city/article32799166.ece
08 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||NCPCR’s ‘blanket’ order riles child rights activists||The recommendation of National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) — that all children in need of care and protection who are in child care institutions (CCI) be sent to their families or placed for adoption and foster care — has drawn criticism from various activists, academics, lawyers, organisations and individuals. The recommendation is applicable to eight States including Karnataka, where the number of CCIs is high. This order does not apply to children who are placed under specialised adoption agencies or children in observation homes. An open letter which has been signed by 517 people and 261 organisations seeks the withdrawal of the letter “in the best interest of children.” They have argued that a blanket drive like this would lead to “serious violation of human rights of children residing in these institutions and render some more vulnerable than ever before.” It will also amount to complete disregard for the procedures established in law, they have said. The signatories have said that although they admit that institutionalisation should be the last resort, removing children from institutional care without considering their peculiar circumstances will inevitably push many children into situations of greater risk of violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation. They also point out that this is particularly worrying during the COVID-19 pandemic that has rendered children and their families more vulnerable. “In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, families have been pushed beyond the margins from food security to housing and livelihood, their problems, including mental health challenges, have increased manifold. Restoring children to such a situation without considering the views of the children and their families and without an assessment cannot be in their best interest,” said the letter. Further, they have also said that the commission by issuing this recommendation to all Deputy Commissioners and District Magistrates has bypassed and undermined the jurisdiction, powers and functions of the Child Welfare Committees established the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. The activists, academics and lawyers have instead recommended that social audit of CCIs should be put on the commission’s website and inputs from different stakeholders including children must be sought to improve the functioning of the child care institutions. Swagata Raha, consultant, Enfold Proactive Health Trust, said that the decision to restore children to their homes cannot be mechanical one. “Many children do not want to go to their homes because of a reason. The are probably at the risk of facing violence or abuse at home,” she said. Ms. Raha also said that children in child care institutions should be restored only after an inquiry is undertaken by the Child Welfare Committee which is done based on social investigation report, individual care plan and after taking into consideration children’s views and reports prepared by the counsellors, social workers or NGOs who are working with the District Child Protection Units.  A blanket drive like this will lead to serious violation of human rights of children residing in child care institutions and render some more vulnerable than ever before.Signatories of the open letter||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ncpcrs-blanket-order-riles-child-rights-activists/article32798784.ece
08 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bengaluru 24th among 30 global cities in dementia innovation||Bengaluru has been ranked 24th in dementia innovation out of 30 global cities, according to a new report released on Wednesday by the Global Coalition on Aging (GCOA), Alzheimer’s Disease International (ADI) and the Lien Foundation. The report, ‘Dementia Innovation Readiness Index 2020: 30 Global Cities’, evaluates the readiness of 30 cities to develop and adopt innovations in dementia and aims to uncover where there are opportunities for innovation across the global dementia community. Dementia innovation readiness is defined in this index as the level to which each city is prepared to innovate in terms of novel approaches, systems, or processes that would have an impact on the prevention, treatment, or care of dementia. The report examines 26 indicators across five categories of innovation readiness – strategy/commitment, early detection/diagnosis, access to care, community support and business environment. The report found that Bengaluru ranks 24 out of the 30 cities evaluated with an overall score of 5.2 out of 10. The city scored low in strategy and commitment, and business environment. Of around two lakh dementia patients in Karnataka, nearly 40,000 are in Bengaluru. Meera Pattabiraman, chair of Alzheimer’s and Related Disorders Society of India (ARDSI), said that Bengaluru should focus on a dementia strategy going forward. “In Bengaluru, experts have implemented community-based screening tools that are calibrated to address specific local issues, like low education rates and heterogeneous cultures and languages,” she said. “Developing a city-specific strategy should be a priority for Bengaluru to address dementia prevalence, and plans have been set in motion to formulate such a strategy.” P.T. Sivakumar, professor of psychiatry and consultant in Geriatric Psychiatry Unit, Department of Psychiatry in NIMHANS, said Bengaluru is among the leading cities in India to have many active initiatives to cover prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for dementia. “Major governmental organisations like NIMHANS, Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) and several non-governmental organisations have made active contributions and innovations in this field. However, considering the global standards and the growing need, we need to further enhance these initiatives into a strategic plan that can have a comprehensive approach to this issue,” he said. Need for awareness Stating that there is a need to create awareness for early diagnosis, reducing stigma and facilitating care with dignity, Dr. Sivakumar said training of primary care physicians and health workers to identify dementia and provide appropriate initial management is required. “Training of family and professional caregivers for dementia care is also important. There is a need to develop a complete range of care systems that are affordable and accessible for those with limited economic capacity on priority. Promoting technological innovations that can support persons with dementia to maintain independence and ensure good quality of life are most important,” he explained. Radha S. Murthy, president of ARDSI’s Bengaluru chapter, said the Society was working towards making Bengaluru dementia-friendly by 2025. “Our support systems are good compared to other cities. We have brought down the cost of care by 40% through tele-medicine. Awareness has increased as a result of which stigma has reduced,” she said. ADI Chief Executive Paola Barbarino said that local leadership is critical in preparing for dementia. “A willingness to act at a local leadership level has been clearly linked to a city’s preparedness and ability to innovate,” she pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bengaluru-24th-among-30-global-cities-in-dementia-innovation/article32799169.ece

08 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Passport appointment availability back to normal||After having to reduce the number of appointments amidst a raging pandemic, the Regional Passport Office (RPO), Bengaluru recently restored the number of appointments to normal after adopting the necessary precautionary measures. But the surge in COVID-19 cases is keeping nearly half of them vacant. As on Wednesday, the number of normal appointments available at the Lalbagh Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) was 1,200. Another 600 were available at the Marathahalli PSK, and 100 enquiry slots at the Koramangala office. In Hubballi-Dharwad and Mangaluru, 450 normal appointments were available. Regional Passport Officer Bharath Kumar Kuthati told The Hindu that only half or less than half the appointments have been taken. “The number of appointments taken has come down to 40% from pre-COVID-19 times. But it has been steadily increasing – from 20% post the first lockdown to around 40% now. Air travel suspension and international travel restrictions were major factors, apart from a general trend of avoiding crowded places,” he said. In March, just days before the first lockdown was announced, the Ministry of External Affairs sent out a directive to reduce appointments. The Bengaluru RPO had then announced a reduction in appointments by half, with officials requesting applicants to return home if they were suffering from symptoms or did not want the passport service as an emergency. “Till a month ago, we had reduced appointments to 50% of the regular number at the PSKs. There were no operations at the Post Office PSKs (POPSKs). We were going by indication given by the Department of Posts. They expressed their readiness a month ago. Since then, we’ve started functioning. PSKs started operating earlier,” Mr. Kuthati explained. Most POPSKs in the State are offering between 20 and 30 appointments. “All our centres are following the Central guidelines scrupulously. Both at the PSKs and POPSKs as well as RPO, wearing of masks, use of sanitisers and maintaining social distancing are being implemented. Initially, we reduced appointments by 50%. But over a period of time, we observed that footfalls have not been more than 50%. So, we’ve opened 100% of all appointments. At POPSKs, we are offering appointments depending on the Department of Posts’ request. At the PSKs, we’re seeing if we need additional personnel. But that may not be necessary as of now,” the RPO added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/passport-appointment-availability-back-to-normal/article32798774.ece
08 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC notice to Registrar-General on plea to use A4 paper in courts||The High Court of Karnataka has ordered issue of notice to its Registrar-General on a PIL petition filed by a group of law students seeking changes in the court’s rule to allow use of A4 size paper for all court proceedings instead of the existing foolscap or legal size paper. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the order on the petition filed by Akriti Agarwal of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh, Bhavana M. of Bengaluru, and Lakshya Purohit of Udaipur in Rajasthan. The petitioners have been campaigning for uniform use of the widely available A4 paper in all the courts across the county, instead of the foolscap or legal size paper, a practice adopted since British rule. They have been also campaigning for printing on both sides of the sheets instead of the practice of allowing printing on only one side of the sheets in some courts.  It was pointed out in the petition that based on their requests, the Supreme Court of India, and the High Courts of Calcutta, Kerala and Tripura, had already modified the norms specifying that A4 sheets should be used for all purposes by courts as well as advocates, besides allowing printing on both sides of the sheets. The petitioners stated that A4 sheets were widely available for common people, whereas the foolscap or legal size paper was available only in shops near courts and hence was not easily accessible. Printing on both sides would result in use of fewer sheets, and thereby help environment, the petitioners contended. The petition said that the petitioner had written a letter in March 2020 to the Registrar-General of the High Court of Karnataka requesting to change the norm, but no action had been taken so far.  The petitioners said that based on their request, the Supreme Court, and the High Courts of Calcutta, Kerala and Tripura, had already modified norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-notice-to-registrar-general-on-plea-to-use-a4-paper-in-courts/article32798949.ece

08 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Discrepancies between State, district health bulletins, says DC||Chamarajnagar Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi disputed the figures used in the analysis, which is based on the State health bulletin, which is different from the district’s bulletin. He said there were several discrepancies between the two. “Our active cases as on Wednesday (October 7) are only 782, and deaths are 72, not as what has been reported in the State bulletin. The non-COVID-19 deaths are 21 and not 11 as reported in the State bulletin,” he said. Asserting that deaths are happening because of late reporting, he said: “They first go to private doctors and by the time they are referred to government facilities, the crucial period is lost.” Admitting that the district saw a surge in cases from August onwards, the Deputy Commissioner said: “Although we managed to remain green even after the unlock phase began, the management became difficult after people started moving and all activities resumed. It is a challenge to sustain the same pace for a prolonged period as it is a dynamic situation. Our system has been designed to manage short term crises and not for a prolonged period.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/discrepancies-between-state-district-health-bulletins-says-dc/article32798781.ece

08 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Soon, collision avoidance mechanism in buses||The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) will be upgrading its technology for its fleet with the aim of reducing accidents. It plans to introduce collision avoidance mechanisms and anti-drowsiness systems that will provide real-time alerts to drivers, conductors and the control room. The technology, said officials, will go a long way in curbing accidents. Anti-drowsiness systems, for instance, are designed to detect a driver’s alertness and can even sound an alarm if the driver dozes off at the wheel. Cameras constantly monitor the driver’s face and retina to detect how alert he or she is. A KSRTC official said trial runs using collision avoidance mechanisms were held and deemed ‘satisfactory’. “Such systems are available in high-end expensive cars and it works perfectly well. This will save hundreds of lives and reduce risk and increase our efficiency,” the official said. The system comprises cameras and multiple features including warning systems for pedestrian collision, information on vehicles approaching from opposite sides, and distance between vehicles around the bus among others. According to sources in the KSRTC, the tender process for implementation of the technology is in the offing and if everything goes as planned, it will be in place within three to four months. “According to our tentative list, around 1,000 buses that will ply at night especially on highways, inter-state buses and those plying ghat sections will get the technology on priority basis,” the KSRTC official added. According to Laxman Savadi, Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister, KSRTC spends around Rs. 100 crore every year on accident compensation and related issues. “It is not only a question of money, more importantly lives are at stake. Our department is in touch with agencies that provide such services and the project will be rolled out soon,” he said. The Minister added that once the system is in place, it will provide better safety measures not just for KSRTC employers but also to drivers, passengers and other motorists. Another corporation official said: “Such mechanisms will help the KSRTC identify vulnerable spots along the bus route especially in the ghat sections. This will further help us in better management of road markers, traffic signs, lights among other things.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/soon-collision-avoidance-mechanism-in-buses/article32798778.ece

08 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Pothole-ridden railway underbridge poses serious threat||Vehicle drivers cruising smoothly on National Highway 75 at Padil will suddenly feel blindfolded even as the vehicle totters no sooner they enter the railway underbridge at Padil on the outskirts of the city. For, the flyover commissioned after an abnormal delay in April 2017 has been in a lower elevation thereby preventing flow of natural light during the daytime and the road surface has got completely damaged following constant water-logging. Built through box-pushing technology, the underbridge has been mired with flaws every since its commissioning. As the surface of the underbridge is below the road surface from both the ends, rainwater always gets accumulated inside and motorists have a tough time particularly during the rainy season. The underbridge is part of the National Highways Authority of India’s Mangaluru Port Connectivity Project between BC Road and Nanthoor. Ramachandra Nayak, who regularly uses the underbridge, said that the NHAI appeared to have made no attempt to address the water-logging issue inside the underpass. Consequently, the underpass is filled with potholes and craters thereby giving shivers to vehicle drivers, he said. There are no lights either inside the underpass which remains pitch dark even during daytime because of its lower position, rued Harniish Raj, an entrepreneur having his office at Kannur. Lack of lighting makes drivers blind when they enter the underpass after a smooth drive from Padil Junction, he said. Rohan Kumar, a two-wheeler rider, said that it would be a test every time he passed through the underbridge as there was every chance of a heavy vehicle hitting him if he applied brakes to avoid craters. Those new to the stretch would have no idea of the road condition and often their vehicles get damaged, he said. The underpass on carriageway of National Highway 75, which was commissioned recently, has no such issues as the carriageway is on the road level on both the sides.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pothole-ridden-railway-underbridge-poses-serious-threat/article32799285.ece
08 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Fishermen seek introduction of the latest communication technology||Prominent fishermen associations of the coastal districts on Wednesday sought immediate intervention by the Union and State governments in adopting modern technology, including satellite-based navigation system, for the fisheries sector to save life and improve livelihood of fishermen. Speaking to reporters in Udupi, North Kanara District Cooperative Fish Marketing Federation chairman Ganapati Mangre noted that hundreds of fishermen lose life every year in the sea due to non-availability of modern connectivity technologies, including satellite-based navigation system. A sophisticated navigation system not only saves their life but also gives indications about the availability of catch. South Canara and Udupi District Cooperative Fish Marketing Federation president Yashpal Suvarna said that the usual methods of communication and warnings were not adequate which came to be highlighted with the missing fishermen onboard the Suvarna Tribhuja last year. It is time that advanced communication and connectivity technologies that are already available are adopted to ensure the fishing sector gets benefited. The leaders said, “The Union government must implement the technologies via standardising quality available across the States. We have tested BSNL’s transponder which has two-way data communication directly over satellite and works in the deep sea. We seek the Prime Minister’s direct intervention and request his government to broadly deploy the latest technology immediately. We need a solution today as any delay will continue to endanger the safety and security of fishermen in the sea.” The latest communication technology would also increase productivity of fishing harvest, create world-class competitiveness, apart from addressing the challenge of ensuring fishermen’s safety. With the availability of new satellite technology, India today has access to services that can ensure the safety of fishermen through ubiquitous coverage that allow fishermen to communicate anywhere and even during the worst of storms, cyclones or other natural calamities. They said that fish cooperatives and boat owners associations were supporting Indian Fishermen for Technology Adoption (IFTA) to bring out numerous issues being faced by fishermen. The focus would remain on digital transformation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fishermen-seek-introduction-of-the-latest-communication-technology/article32799290.ece
08 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||More space in new residential quarters for pourakarmikas||Responding to the demand for more floor area for their quarters, the Mangaluru City Corporation has proposed to increase floor area for the 32 one-bedroom apartments to be constructed in the second phase of the construction of quarters for pourakarmikas, corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar said here on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the pourakarmika Day, Mr. Sridhar said that the floor area of each house will be increased from 303 sq ft to 505 sq ft. The second phase of quarters construction will be taken up shortly after the completion of allocation of 32 quarters constructed in the first phase. The corporation also needs to resolve the issue about retired pourakarmikas staying in the old quarters that needs to be brought down to build the new quarters in the second phase. Retired pourakarminkas are not eligible for quarters, he said. It was in 2015 that the corporation took up the first phase of constructing 32 ground plus three floor quarters at Mahakalipadpu at an estimated cost of Rs. 2.40 crore. These houses are now ready for occupation. Mr. Sridhar said that 60 % of the 32 beneficiaries have agreed to move to the new quarters. The remaining 40 % are not willing as they say that the houses were too small for their requirement. “ We are in talks with them and hope to resolve it,” he said. Senior councillor Premanand Shetty said that increase in the floor area of houses in the second phase entails increase in the per unit cost from Rs. 7 lakh to Rs. 11 lakh. “The corporation will bear this additional sum from the 24.1% funds earmarked for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes welfare,” he said. And, the third phase of construction of 32 quarters will be taken up shortly, he added. Earlier, speaking at the function, Mr. Sridhar commended the services of pourakarmikas of the corporation and those attached to Antony Waste Management Cell Private Limited for keeping the streets of the city clean. He said that steps are being taken to repair the 12 ward offices and provide proper change room facility for pourakarmikas. The corporation is considering replicating the model of the Bruhat Benglauru Mahanagara Palike and have a mobile change room facility.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/more-space-in-new-residential-quarters-for-pourakarmikas/article32799293.ece

Jagadeesha on Wednesday directed officials managing temples in the district to take all precautionary measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 during the upcoming festival season. Chairing a meeting of administrators and other officers of temples in Udupi, Mr. Jagadeesha said that a large number of people were expected to visit temples during the Navarathri, Deepavali and other festivals in the coming days. Temple managements should ensure that COVID-19 guidelines were strictly followed while allowing people to participate in sevas and festivities. Temple administrations should mark boxes at every 6 ft distance, provide hand washing/ sanitiser facility and ensure that visitors wear masks. They may take the help of the police to regulate crowd, if more people are visiting temples. While fairs, Brahmotsavas, Pavithrotsavas, etc., were temporarily banned, temples that could not stop these rituals may hold them inside the premises with the participation of only the required staff, he said. Meanwhile, managements should thoroughly sanitise temple premises and surrounding areas every time after any programme, during the night and the day. They also should display publicity material on COVID-19 awareness and make public announcements at repeated intervals. Temples that were already conducting Anna Santarpane (mass feeding) may continue to do it by adhering to the guidelines, though starting such a programme afresh was not encouraged, Mr. Jagadeesha said. Temple managements should also ensure owners and staff of shops and establishments around the temples wear face masks and ensure social distancing. Assistant Commissioners, Tahsildars and police officers should visit temples in their jurisdiction at regular intervals to ensure that guidelines are being followed. Additional Deputy Commissioner B. Sadashiva Prabhu, Muzrai Tahsildar Sudhakar and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/udupi-temples-asked-to-take-preventive-steps/article32799286.ece

08 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||New association of private teachers formed||The Dakshina Kannada district unit of Karnataka Khasagi Shikshakara Balaga, an association of private school teachers, was opened here on Wednesday. Talking to reporters, Nagesh C.N., president of the Balaga headquartered in Hassan, said the association was trying to bring together private school teachers to fight for payment of minimum wages and for service benefits. He said private primary and secondary teachers continue to get paltry salaries. Though the apex court has said that these teachers should be paid Rs. 30,500 and Rs. 20,200 respectively per month, most private schools were not doing so. “The problem has been precarious in the last seven months as many teachers have lost jobs. They are forced to take up odd jobs to run their families.” The State government is yet to take action. The Balaga, he said, was turning into a State-level organisation of 3.65 lakh private teachers. The district unit of the Balaga was opened in Udupi on Tuesday. The Chamarajanagar district unit will be opened on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/new-association-of-private-teachers-formed/article32799298.ece

08 October 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Now, choultry owners in Mysuru cry foul over high property tax||The COVID-19 pandemic-induced blow to the economy has brought an alleged anomaly in the levy of property tax for certain commercial establishments in Mysuru into sharp focus. Marriage choultry owners have now joined hotel owners and film exhibitors in calling for scrapping of the “super commercial” category in property tax structure. After hotel owners and film exhibitors in Mysuru expressed their ire over the exorbitant amount of property tax they have to cough up, it was the turn of a delegation from Mysuru Kalyana Mantapa Owners Association to submit a memorandum to Mayor Tasneem, requesting the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) to pass a resolution to scrap the “super commercial” category. Association president K.R. Sathyaranarayan told The Hindu marriage choultry owners are reeling under an unprecedented economic crunch due to the restrictions on gatherings for marriages and other events. The marriage choultry owners had suffered huge losses due to cancellation of the marriages booked after March 2020. Also, the future looks gloomy with marriages of large gatherings unlikely to return at least till March 2021 as the authorities have placed a ceiling of on the number of attendees at such events. Hence, he said the Association had urged the MCC authorities to waive the property tax applicable on marriage choultries for the year, besides scrapping “super commercial” category that had caused a financial burden on the owners, who already have to bear GST, electricity bill, water bill, and trade licence fee, besides the salaries of the personnel and security. Mysuru Hotel Owners Association President Narayana Gowda said the MCC created the “super commercial” category for property tax payment about 12 years ago. While the domestic or residential category of property owners pay about 0.9 per cent of the guidance value of property as property tax, commercial category of property owners pay about 1.5 per cent of its guidance value, Mr. Gowda said adding that the “super commercial” category of properties such as marriage choultries, malls, hotels and lodges, besides movie theatres, pay 2.28 per cent. Benefit Mr. Sathyanarayana contended that the choultry owners will be able to save about 25 to 30 per cent of the tax if they are brought under the commercial category. Mr. Sathyanarayana and Mr. Narayana Gowda said the “super commercial” category of property tax payment is not in vogue in any other part of the State including Bengaluru. “It is a huge burden on the businesses in Mysuru”, said Mr. Gowda, calling for its immediate scrapping. While the Mayor assured the delegation of marriage choultry owners that the matter will be taken up in the MCC council meeting, sources in the MCC said any change in the tax structure needs to be brought before the council and an approval needs to be secured to bring about any change in the by-laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/now-choultry-owners-in-mysuru-cry-foul-over-high-property-tax/article32798933.ece
08 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Manasagangotri may have a COVID-19 testing centre||A full-fledged sample collection centre for COVID-19 testing may come up on the Manasagangotri campus of University of Mysore as the district administration wants to ramp up testing here to contain the spread of the infection. Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar told The Hindu that the district health officer had visited the campus and discussed about having a centre that could collect nearly 500 swab samples a day. The samples collected would be sent to the respective testing labs for RT-PCR testing. “The district administration wanted we have a sample collection centre. Anybody can give their swabs for the test. As of now, a small sample centre is functioning on the campus. The facilities and other logistics required for the expanding the centre was discussed with the DHO,” he said. Meanwhile, at the academic council meeting here on Wednesday, the V-C said the university will explore the possibilities of establishing a COVID-19 care centre on the campus for housing any infected students. “We can have a facility with eight to ten beds for isolating the students infected with COVID-19. As of now, there are no students on the campus. If need be, the university will set up such a facility in the interest of students,” he said. Some members at the meeting said the campuses may resume classes sooner or later depending the Centre’s advisory.

08 October 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Speculation over GTD’s visit to DKS’ residence||Former Minister G.T. Deve Gowda’s visit to the residence of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) chief D.K. Shivakumar in Bengaluru on Wednesday sparked speculation in political circles in Mysuru. The former Minister’s criticism of the BJP government for the raids on the premises belonging to Mr. Shivakumar had raised questions over the possibility of Mr .Gowda, a JD (S) MLA nursing a grouse against his party leadership, moving closer to the Congress. Fielding reporters’ queries in the regard, Congress leader and former Minister Tanveer Sait said the Congress will welcome anybody who is willing to uphold secular and constitutional values. “Anybody accepting the Congress party’s principles is welcome to join the party and help in nation-building”, he said. “At least he is not selling himself stealthily to another party”, Mr. Sait remarked. Meanwhile, Mr. Gowda, after calling on Mr. Shivakumar in Bengaluru, recalled the efforts he and the Congress leader had made when 17 MLAs from the coalition had resigned from the Assembly and were closeted in a hotel in Mumbai. “We were denied entry and we had even staged a dharna before the police took us away”, Mr. Gowda recalled. Further, the JD(S) MLA said he had a special bond with Mr. Shivakumar even though both of them were in different parties. He said he wished to instil confidence and courage in Mr. Shivakumar. The government should not have allowed such raids on Mr. Shivakumar’s house after elections had been declared, Mr. Gowda said. Though Mr. Gowda continues as a JD(S) MLA, representing Chamundeshwari Assembly constituency, he has maintained a distance from the party leadership, staying away from the party’s programmes and meetings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/speculation-over-gtds-visit-to-dks-residence/article32798938.ece

08 October 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Tribals staring at lack of livelihood opportunities||The economic downturn as a fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic and its cascading impact has affected the tribal people in Mysuru district most of whom are unemployed since the last few months. Though the nutrition aspect has been taken care of through the distribution of ration under various Central and State government schemes, labour opportunities have diminished due to slowdown in economic activity. While it is mandatory for the authorities to ensure that they are given employment for at least 100 days in an year under the MGNREGA, not many are benefiting, according to M.B. Prabhu, a tribal rights activist functioning from Veeranahosahalli in Hunsur. “There are hundreds of Jenu Kurubas, Betta Kurubas, Soligas and Yeravas without jobs in Hunsur, Periyapatana, H.D. Kote belt’’, he added. A majority of them used to be employed in the plantation sector in Kodagu. But the region is under distress due to the pandemic and the repeated floods that hit the district for three consecutive years. ’Earlier, the labour contractors used to transport tribals from Veeranhosahalli and surrounding villages to coffee plantations in Kodagu and this was a major source of livelihood for the tribal community. But the fear of the pandemic has put an end to the free movement of labour and has rendered the tribals unemployed’’, said Mr. Prabhu. Though the local agricultural activity has provided employment and helped a section of the tribals to sustain themselves for a few weeks, the plantations in Kodagu were the main source of employment for the community and that has been affected this year, said S. Sreekanth of Development through Education, an NGO fighting for tribal rights. “Plantations in Kodagu used to provide sustenance from December to April/May but the lockdown this year dashed all the prospects’’, he added. Bulk of job creation under MGNREGA is for desilting of lakes and water bodies during summer. But all the waterbodies were full during summer early this year due to heavy rains last year and hence no work could be taken up. Unremunerative prices In case of tribals who tilled their land and cultivated maize, none of them received remunerative rates as the crop was sold to middlemen for half the market rates in the absence of any institutional mechanism to procure the crop from them directly, said Mr. Prabhu. Though DEED used to provide skill development like carpentry, tailoring, driving to the tribals, it was disbanded this year due to the pandemic and the next batch of tribals will be trained only during summer once the situation eases, said Mr. Sreekanth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tribals-staring-at-lack-of-livelihood-opportunities/article32798944.ece

Sriramulu on Wednesday said he will be submitting a report to Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar in about a week’s time on the issue of reopening of schools and colleges in the State. The report contains opinions from various experts, including specialist doctors, eminent healthcare professionals and educationists, on the issue. Speaking to reporters before holding a meeting here for assessing the pandemic situation in Mysuru district, the Minister said he had a virtual meeting with various healthcare personalities and senior bureaucrats of his department to elicit opinions on whether the schools can be reopened when COVID-19 cases are surging and the precautions that need to be be taken for the children’s safety. This meeting gains importance since guidelines had to be framed by the department like how it did when the SSLC examination was conducted with all precautionary measures. “Children’s safety is my priority. We need to address the concerns of parents as well. It is the time to take everyone into confidence on the issue of reopening schools and colleges. Counselling sessions are also necessary before reopening since the children had been out of the schools for several months. All factors have to be looked into before a decision is taken,” the Minister told reporters. In this connection, the Health Department’s suggestions based on experts’ opinions are being collated and a report will be presented to Mr. Suresh Kumar soon. Mr. Sriramulu said the Centre has identified 60 districts in 17 States that have reported a spike in COVID-19 infections. In Karnataka, Bengaluru and Mysuru have been identified as “hotspots” and strategies are being advised for containing the cases. Besides cases, the death rate is also high in Mysuru. This has become a cause for concern, he said, adding that contact tracing should become effective for curbing the cases. On Dasara, the Minister said the government has already decided on low-key festivities. “In the recent video-conference on COVID-19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had told Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to take all precautions for containing the pandemic during the festive season. I am here to discuss what precautions are necessary to be taken.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/health-dept-will-give-its-opinion-on-reopening-of-schools-sriramulu/article32798942.ece

The gift they are seeking is a traffic-free Cubbon Park. They are gathering letters, addressed to the Chief Minister, expressing opposition to vehicular movement inside the park. Prabha Dev, one of the volunteers, said that they had already reached out to city MLAs and MLCs. Many had agreed to support the cause, and some had even sent letters supporting the cause. “We are expecting a response from all of them. Once we get the letters of support, we will submit a memorandum to the CM with the letters from MLAs and MLCs,” Ms. Dev said and added that it was being done in a democratic way. “We did not want to stop with a protest. Hence we have taken up this initiative as the State government is adamant on allowing traffic inside the park.” Volunteers say that the unique campaign has been getting a positive response with various MLAs, including S. Raghu and Sowmya Reddy among others, agreeing to officially extend support to the cause. Speaking to The Hindu , C.V. Raman Nagar MLA S. Raghu said that the extra time due to a pradakshine around the park, if vehicular movement inside is banned, would not take more than 3-4 minutes. “By banning vehicular movement, we will not only save prime lung space but we will also be venerating the park by putting a pradakshine and setting a great precedent,” he said. In her letter addressed to the Chief Minister, Jayanagar MLA Sowmya Reddy has stated that like Lalbagh even Cubbon Park ‘should be saved as generational equity’. “Those using the park as a thoroughfare should avoid it at all costs and instead let pedestrians, elders and children cherish the open space. A prerequisite for dreary cramped urban life,” the letter stated. Cubbon Park, which was closed for vehicular movement since imposition of the lockdown, was opened for vehicular traffic from the second week of September. General public, many experts and environmentalists and activists have been fighting for years to convert the park into a “no traffic zone”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/traffic-free-cubbon-park-campaigners-seek-gift/article32799164.ece

We believe Ricky had given shelter to the accused,” said a senior CCB official. The CCB has confiscated Ricky’s phone for technical analysis in the hope that the data will shed some light on their probe. The police suspect him of being in touch with some of the accused in the drug peddling racket and attending parties they had organised. “The main focus of the investigations right now is to track down Shiva Prakash, the prime accused in the drug case, Sheikh Faazil and Aditya Alva. They are crucial to the case,” the official added. Alva, who is the son of the late minister Jeevaraj Alva, and others have been accused of organising parties and facilitating the sale and use of drugs. Many of the accused were regular visitors to the farmhouse of Alva where parties were organised on weekends, claim the CCB. On Tuesday, CCB officials reached Ricky’s apartment at Sadashiva Nagar.

When masks were first made mandatory in Bengaluru this May, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) fixed the penalty at Rs. 1,000 for the first violation and Rs. 2,000 for subsequent violations. However, it was revised to Rs. 200 soon after. The CM’s order was received around 4 p.m. on Wednesday. “We stopped fining citizens soon after and only issued strict warnings,” said a marshal. According to sources in the BBMP, hand-held machines used by the marshals will have to be recalibrated as they are automated to issue receipts for Rs. 1,000. “The recalibration should be completed on Thursday,” sources said, and added that irrespective of the fine amount, there was now better awareness among people about the importance of wearing masks properly. Srinivas Alavilli from Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy said the government had to first launch targeted communication campaigns to ensure all citizens know the importance of wearing masks. “That apart, more than the quantum of fine, it is the certainty of being fined that makes the difference,” he said and added that a bit of ‘Gandhigiri’ would also work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-govt-reduces-fine-for-not-wearing-masks/article32799177.ece

Similarly, it has recommended three names – Dr. Rajesh Gowda, S.R. Gowda, and B.K. Manjunath for Sira. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is said to be strongly backing the candidature of Mr. Munirathna on the grounds that the party had assured him ticket while convincing him to quit Assembly membership to topple the then coalition government headed by H.D. Kumaraswamy. However, the ball is in the court of the party high command. October 16 is the last day for filling nominations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-likely-to-announce-choice-today/article32798953.ece

About Rs. 40 lakh will be disbursed as grant in multiple instalments, according to an official release. COVID-19 response grant is exclusively for the development of products and services specifically useful in the fight against the pandemic. The final outcome of the work should be ‘development of a prototype/formulation/process/Minimum Viable Product (MVP), which can be scalable for deployment.’ Idea grant The varsity had received applications under the idea grant for potential start-ups having a brilliant idea or research output, which the innovators wanted to scale-up to a commercial level. The product grant for start-ups is meant for those who have completed their prototype and are seriously looking at final product development before hitting the market. The screening of application forms were done by an expert panel set up by Vice Chancellor K.N. Madhusoodanan and it comprised academicians and industry experts. Twenty-four start-ups under various domains such as electronic hardware, biotechnology, marine science, polymer and software applications were recommended by the committee initially. The university has plans to upgrade its Technology Business Incubator to a state-of-the-art facility with assistance under RUSA.

Sarith, all accused in the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case, in a trial court here under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, plans to probe the role of M. Sivasankar, the former Principal Secretary to the Kerala Chief Minister in the whole episode. The agency said the role of Mr. Sivasankar, who was a key person in the present government, in the entire episode of crime had to be thoroughly investigated and he and other accused had to be confronted with the mirror image of the electronic evidences. The agency had also confronted him with some of his ‘whatsoever’ messages, which it retrieved. The investigations revealed that Swapna had earned lucrative profits from the smuggling and the proceeds of the crime so derived was kept in the bank locker in the form of gold and cash, the chargesheet said. Swapna’s statement In her statements to the ED, according to the chargesheet, Swapna said she was selected to Space Park project as she was close to Mr. Sivasankar and her appointment in the Space Park was with the knowledge of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. She further gave statements that she officially met Mr. Sivasankar eight times but met him unofficially many times. She said she met Mr. Sivasankar five to six times in the presence of the Chief Minister. She also gave the statement that the Chief Minister knew her as secretary to the Consular General. She said it was Mr. Sivasankar who told her about the Space Park project and asked her to meet Jayasankar, Managing Director of the Kerala State Information Technicality Infrastructure Limited, under which the project was implemented, and Santhosh, Special Officer, to discuss about the job. Swapna further stated that Mr. Sivasankar told her that “he would discuss the matter with the Chief Minister and do the needful and thereafter she got a call from Mr. Santhosh.” She also gave a statement to the ED that she got commission by executing deals between the UAE consulate and UAFX Solutions Private Limited, Forth Force, Unitac Builders and Sane Ventures and for the project for renovation of 150 homes in Kerala during the 2018 floods. Though Swapna claimed to have obtained significant amount as commission, she could not provide any evidence to substantiate her claim, the chargesheet noted. The ED stated that the investigations carried out under the Act and the evidences gathered so far had clearly established that the accused committed the offence of money laundering and were liable to be prosecuted and punished.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ed-files-chargesheet-against-swapna-2-others/article32798914.ece
08 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||KMRL to set up more solar power systems||Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) is adding 5.4 MWp (mega watt peak, a solar power measure in photo-voltaic industry) of solar systems on its buildings and tracks this year to increase the solar power output to 1.57 crore units per year and also to attain 60% energy neutrality. This is in addition to the three large-scale solar power generation systems commissioned by it in the past two years. A communication from KMRL said that the first phase of the project, with 2.67 MWp capacity and capable of generating 36.5 lakh units per year, was implemented through RESCO (Renewable Energy Service Company) in 2018. This contributed to 60% of the total energy consumed at that point in time. But it was reduced to 30% with the opening of the new stations along the Maharaja’s-Thykoodam stretch. “We are pushing for maximising the solar energy generation. We have a Solar Energy Policy in place and are installing solar plants in all our areas, as far as possible, to gain green and clean power. The same will be replicated in the Water Metro project also,” said KMRL MD Alkesh Kumar Sharma. The agency has completed installation of solar panels at Thykoodam metro station and work is under way at Vyttila, Petta, South, Kadavanthra and Elamkulam. There are also plans to install solar panels at JLN Stadium metro station’s rooftop of the corporate office, and track and ramp area at Muttom depot. The installation of rooftop solar panels will be completed by mid-November and the remaining work by December. This initiative had brought down carbon emissions by 13,302 tonnes a year, which was equal to planting 5,33,033 trees, the agency claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kmrl-to-set-up-more-solar-power-systems/article32799261.ece
08 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Clamour for dedicated FLTCs for policemen, accused gets louder||There is a shrill call by the police for dedicated first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) both for police personnel and the accused testing positive for SARS-COV-2 as their numbers keep rising. With over 60 active positive cases in the city police and 21 in the rural police, not to mention nearly 200 cops in quarantine after having come into contact with the infected, the Kerala Police Association (KPA) has raised such a demand with District Police Chiefs and the District Collector. “We have identified a private hostel near the Kaloor stadium as a potential FLTC for infected cops from the city limits and the recommendation has been forwarded to the Collector. The Collector has to declare it as the FLTC for it to get the service of doctor and paramedical staff and, other facilities,” said N.V. Nishad, district secretary (Kochi City), KPA. As of now, the majority of the infected cops are isolating themselves in their homes and only those who cannot afford it are undergoing treatment at FLTCs opened by various local bodies. The police had opened dedicated quarantine centres for their personnel when the case loaded started surging months ago but even that had attracted complaints about inadequate facilities. Twin problems The increasing instances of the accused testing positive and even jumping custody exploiting the scant security and surveillance at the FLTC being run at the convention centre of the Kochi airport where they are now being put up along with the infected from the general public has led to the demand for a separate facility for the accused as well. “It creates twin issues of putting cops in danger of getting infected by the accused as they either have to intervene to thwart escape bids or recapture the accused besides facing the prospects of suspension in the event the accused managing to flee,” said M.V. Sanil, district secretary (Ernakulam Rural), KPA. Two cops remain under suspension after Suresh aka ‘Dracula’ Suresh, a serial robber, jumped custody multiple times. The police have tentatively identified a portion of a COVID centre being run at NUALS at Kalamasserry as a potential facility for keeping the infected accused from both the city and rural limits. “There is a compound wall enabling adequate security of the accused unlike the FLTC at the Kochi airport with multiple exits and entry points, and where the police are dependent on health workers to monitor the accused,” said Mr. Nishad. Though the police have not openly raised it, there is a sentiment among large sections of the force to scale down their role in quarantine checking and contact tracing now that the numbers are too high for such a system to be practical and cops are also getting infected at a rapid rate, affecting their routine policing duties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/clamour-for-dedicated-fltcs-for-policemen-accused-gets-louder/article32799267.ece

The move was in the wake of an order by the Additional Court Ernakulam against an execution petition filed by the Palace Administration Board of the Kochi Palace from which the civic body had acquired the land in 1989. The order was issued on September 28. The attachment was an outcome of the long-running litigation dating back to the 90s over the compensation paid for the land at the time of the acquisition. “A division bench of the High Court had ordered the corporation in 2011 to pay a compensation of Rs. 1.85 lakh per are since the original compensation of around Rs. 66,000 per are was found inadequate. However, the corporation neither did pay the compensation nor diligently presented its case in the court even thereafter,” said V.K. Prasad, the lawyer representing the Palace Administration Board. Mayor Soumini Jain said that the corporation was not the requisition agency and that the government had acquired the land. “We will, however, study the case in detail and take appropriate decision when the case comes up next on October 14,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/city-corporations-land-where-its-new-building-being-built-attached/article32799270.ece
08 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Local bodies liable for waste management rule violations||The Local Self-Government Department (LSGD) has suggested amendments to the Kerala Panchayati Raj Act and the Kerala Municipality Act to fix responsibility on the council of each local body and its chairman for non-compliance with the Solid Waste Management Rules (SWM), 2016. The proposal came up for discussion at a recent meeting convened by Chief Secretary Vishwas Mehta to discuss action to be taken on the orders of the Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for timely compliance with the SWM Rules. The tribunal had on September 16 warned that it might consider detention in prison of those violating its orders till compliance. “This course of action may have to be considered even against the highest erring officers, if the default continues,” it had said. The Bench had asked the Chief Secretary to inform the erring officials that they would not be entitled to draw their salaries from a specified date till compliance with the rules. The meeting observed that the secretaries of local bodies did not have delegation and were required to get the approval of the municipal council or chairman, even though they were entitled to fulfil their responsibilities in accordance with the SWM Rules, 2016. “Any delay or non-performance on the part of the municipal council would eventually reflect as the non-performance of the secretary. In this context, it was informed that amendments are to be made in the Panchayati Raj Act and Rules and the Municipality Act and Rules of the State to fix the responsibilities on the council and chairman for non-implementation of the SWM Rules, 2016,” said the minutes of the meeting. The LSGD will direct the local bodies to submit annual reports specifying the progress made in the implementation of the SWM Rules, 2016 before it and the State Pollution Control Board. The government will inform the tribunal that it has initiated steps for solid waste management under mission mode through agencies like Suchitwa Mission and Clean Kerala Company. The LSGD will have to ensure that the deadlines for the various solid waste management projects are met without failure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/local-bodies-liable-for-waste-management-rule-violations/article32798802.ece

Patients with this rare condition have muscle weakness and a spectrum of severe complications, and often require long term, specialised treatments and management through Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT). Sheela Nampoothiri, head of paediatric genetics, Amrita Hospital, said the patient had undergone the entire cycle of pregnancy to deliver a healthy baby as she had been put on the life-saving ERT under an access programme around six years ago after she was diagnosed with juvenile onset of Pompe disease. Dr. Sheela said that this case was a testimony that patients diagnosed with rare diseases such as Pompe could lead a near-normal life if they were put on life-saving treatment early. The new-born female child, which weighed 2.8 kg at birth, did not have the defective gene and was free of Pompe disease, she said.

The KCBC Commission for Education said on Wednesday that the government deciding what should be taught in schools would curtail diversity in education, have consequent educational, social and political dimensions and therefore remained a cause for anxiety. The new policy would deny the students the chance to choose polytechnic or ITI-like training after completion of 10th standard. The proposal that students should be given a chance to study various subjects in higher education presented serious practical difficulties. The moot question was, how many colleges in India, which hardly boast a handful of educational institutions of global standing, would have the capability to self-govern, the body said. The policy, the KCBC maintained, would lead to a concentration of power at the Centre, with the States reduced to onlookers. The commission expressed reservations about the language policy and a potential commercialisation of good academic institutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kcbc-voices-concern-over-national-education-policy/article32798809.ece

08 October 2020||KOLLAM,KERALA||Fishers facing yet another crisis||With several fish landing centres across the State sealed off due to COVID-19 and fishing villages repeatedly falling into containment zone, fishers in Kerala are facing yet another crisis. While most other sectors are limping back to normalcy, marine capture fisheries, mainly mechanised fleets, continue to remain in troubled waters. “They have reopened Cochin harbour after 10 days and at present all four major harbours of Kollam are not functioning. A string of others, including those in Munambam, Vypeen, Beypore, and Puthiyappa, were closed at different times making it impossible for the industry to stay afloat. It is a seasonal industry and boats from neighbouring States are currently exploiting Kerala’s strict fishing protocols. What we need is a more practical guideline as all fishers, both small scale and large scale, are affected,” says Joseph Xavier Kalappurakkal, general secretary, All Kerala Fishing Boat Operators Association. Since all boats have been instructed to return to the harbours of origin after fishing, it is also not possible for the trawlers to ferry the catch to any other place and market it. Deep-sea fishing was also hit due to the uncertainty over the sector and according to fishers the season ends by November. “A lot of curbs, including the restrictions on the number of boats, days, and crew members are already in place. Closing down the fish landing centres time and again will aggravate the situation and cause law and order issues. We have already lost numerous working days and if this pattern continues the sector will not be able to recover,” says Baby, fisher from Azheekkal. According to officials, strict clampdowns are the only option as the thickly populated fishing villages, crowded harbours, and auction halls pose a major challenge. A considerable number of contact cases were reported from the coastal belt of Kollam during the last week forcing the authorities to close down the harbours and auction halls. Increasingly negligent  “Apart from fishers, several police and fisheries officials posted on duty at the harbourers had tested positive. After Unlock 4 that further eased the restrictions, people have become increasingly negligent when it comes to ‘break the chain’ guidelines. At present, minor fish landing centres are open for traditional fishers and the main harbours will be functional as cases recede,” says Fisheries Deputy Director K.Suhair. The Health Department has point out non-compliance of COVID-19 protocols and practical difficulties in maintaining physical distancing norms as the main reason for local transmission. “Most of the houses are located close to each other and if a single person contracts the virus it will spread in the entire area. Among the persons who tested positive from the coastal regions, most are fishers and fish vendors. We will not be able to handle the situation without enforcing extra restrictions,” says an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/curbs-leave-fishers-helpless/article32798890.ece

08 October 2020||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Electrocution: probe finds fault with KSEB officials||Amidst the raging protest over the electrocution of a 48-year-old dairy farmer near Vaikom, a preliminary investigation by the Electrical Inspectorate in Kottayam has pointed to serious lapses on the part of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB). According to James Kutty Thomas, Electrical Inspector, the power line had been lying abandoned for long, but the KSEB officials seemed clueless. “This was an accident long waiting to happen as the line had been active despite complaints from the public,” he said. While the protocol stipulated that the KSEB officials inspect the power cables on a periodic basis, no one had visited the location for long. “Instances of low-lying power cables, damaged power poles and obsolete power lines are so common across the low-lying region from Vaikom to Kumarakom. At the same time, the employees at the KSEB section offices here are being rotated regularly for no solid reasons,” the official added. KSEB version The KSEB officials, meanwhile, clarified that the line had not been disconnected as it was used an interlink to provide electricity in case of a breakdown of the existing lines. K.V. Raju of Padinjarekkara in Udayanapuram, near Vaikom, was electrocuted the other day when he went to a field near his house to cut grass. Eyewitness accounts suggested that the power line had snapped about three months ago. The power line that passed through the field had fallen into disuse after the KSEB drew a new cable along a nearby road. Despite several complaints from the local residents against the delay in clearing the obsolete line, the KSEB officials had not inspected the line. Rahul Raj, son of the deceased, told mediapersons that the KSEB officials did not even attend his phone calls to inform them about the electrocution. “While attempting to rescue my father, who was lying on the field, I too suffered a mild shock. The body could be retrieved only after people removed the fuse of the power line,” he said. Earlier on Tuesday, irate residents had stormed the KSEB section office at Vaikom and damaged a couple of motorcycles.  Local people say line got snapped 3 months ago ‘Despite complaints, KSEB staff did not inspect line’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/electrocution-probe-finds-fault-with-kseb-officials/article32798886.ece

This is the highest single-day spike so far. Health officials pointed out that 9,951 samples had been tested in the last 24 hours, and that the results of 9,776 were made available on Wednesday. The test positivity ratio, which determines the prevalence of the infection among the tested population, remains high at 15.04%. It is thrice the standard of 5% set by the World Health Organisation.

08 October 2020||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Parties gear up for local body polls||Mainstream political parties have started getting down to business for the upcoming three-tier local bodies polls even as the State Election Commission is yet to notify the dates for the elections. The parties have set in motion the process of the seat-sharing at the grassroots level with the procedures for the draw of lots for selecting the reservation wards in the district panchayats, block panchayats, grama panchayats, municipalities and corporations being completed. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the electorate will witness political parties sounding the poll bugle in a reconstructed format of digital mode electioneering. The Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front will officially begin the seat-sharing exercise at the State level on Saturday while the Congress-led United Democratic Front will scrutinise the reports of the sub committees at the panchayats from Thursday. This time, the CPI(M) will have to make efforts to accommodate the new coalition partners, the Indian National League (INL) and Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD), which are eyeing for more seats. In the previous polls held in 2015, the erstwhile Janata Dal (United) when it was with the UDF, had emerged victorious in 65 grama panchayat wards, 13 in block panchayats, four in district panchayats, 12 in municipalities and three in corporations in the State. Then the INL had a tactical understanding with the LDF in most local bodies. Further, the CPI(M) will have to spare some seats to the Kerala Congress (M) if it finally decides to align with the Left parties, thus beginning a new electoral relationship for the Assembly polls next year. Party sources said the Congress-led coalition would hold State-level talks by October 15. Already, leaders of the Congress and the IUML held bi-lateral talks to capture some civic bodies such as Kozhikode Corporation where the combine has been struggling for a long time to dethrone the Left coalition. The combine will also have to tackle the issue of a section of IUML clamouring for an understanding with the Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI)-backed Welfare Party of India. For the BJP-led NDA, its leaders claimed they had begun the process almost six months ago to capture some municipalities and corporations. Senior leaders have been tasked with each civic body, especially Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram Corporations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/parties-gear-up-for-local-body-polls/article32798797.ece
08 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Bus on Demand proves a hit in Kozhikode district||The Bus on Demand (BOND) service launched by the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) to offer pre-booked daily service to commuters on select routes is proving a success in Kozhikode district. With the launch of the latest service between Vadakara and Kalpetta on Wednesday, there are now five exclusive BOND services, benefiting over 200 regular passengers. The services are available between Thottilpalam and Civil Station, Thalassery and Calicut University, Thamarassery and Kozhikode Corporation, and Thiruvambady and Kozhikode city. Considering the warm response, four more routes between Koorachundu and Kozhikode, Balussery and Baby Memorial Hospital, Thamarassery and Calicut University, and Thamarassery and Iqra Hospital have been identified for the service. Project coordinators said BOND services were now being explored mostly by working professionals who had earlier been depending on private vehicles or local buses. As the entry is exclusively reserved for travel card holders, the services offer a premium feel to commuters thanks to strict timings, convenient boarding options, assured seats, and non-stop travel, they added. The routes have been fixed in such a way to benefit maximum number of commuters. Exclusive helplines have been launched to answer their queries and grievances. The trips are offered by maintaining the COVID-19 protocol. Since commuters with reserved seats do not have a chance to mingle with other travellers, they also enjoy a safe journey. Travel cards for just five days or a month are now available at the KSRTC’s reservation desk. Though it is a premium service, officials have made it clear that they charge only reasonable fare based on the distance. Efforts are also on to add more features to the BOND service considering its popularity. For the KSRTC, one of the biggest advantages of the service is that it can get funds in advance and use them for effective planning of trips. It is a mutually rewarding experience, as commuters can enjoy uninterrupted journey even during the peak hours and assured seating arrangements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bus-on-demand-proves-a-hit-in-kozhikode-district/article32798800.ece
08 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||BJP seems keen to woo leaders from other parties||The elevation of A.P. Abdullakutty as vice president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) appears to indicate that the party’s Central leadership is keeping its doors open for disgruntled leaders from other parties in the State. A senior party functionary says the elevation of Mr. Abdullakutty could result in more leaders joining the BJP from the Congress-led United Democratic Front and the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front. After bringing Mr. Abdullakutty to national limelight, the Central leadership has stepped up its political manoeuvring to woo leaders from other parties. Besides, the BJP desperately wants to shed its unipolar image of a Hindu party ahead of the Assembly polls, he says. Minority votes Many of his detractors dub Mr. Abdullakutty a political opportunist. But he could leverage his political skills in a bipolar polity like in Kerala. None can dismiss his journey switching parties from the CPI(M) to the Congress following expulsion and finally joining the BJP last year. He would help the BJP target the minority vote bank, especially the Muslim community. However, the rejig at the national level has perturbed the RSS leadership which had been hoping that former State presidents Kummanam Rajasekharan and P.K. Krishnadas would be part of the Central team. The elevation of Mr. Abdullakutty bypassing seniors also appear to be a warning to the State leadership which has not risen to the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-seems-keen-to-woo-leaders-from-other-parties/article32798801.ece

Quick Response Teams and policemen were deployed in the area to oversee the flawless implementation of regulations and adopt instant action against health protocol violators. Only traders who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 were allowed to resume business. There were several shoppers who could not make use of the relaxations, as their workers were in quarantine. At the same time, a few elderly traders voluntarily kept away from reopening shops. The market had remained shut for over a fortnight after 232 persons, including traders and labourers, tested positive for the virus. It was the biggest count ever reported from a market area in Kozhikode district. Following the unexpected test results, over 700 persons had been asked to undergo antigen test in view of public safety. Meanwhile, some traders were of the view that the risk factor was still there owing to the unscientific measures adopted to control crowd. They claimed that surveillance by a few policemen and QRT members would not be enough to cover such a wide area with multiple entry and exit points. “For a well-organised mall or shopping centre, crowd control measures will work. Here, more planning is needed,” said Prasannakumar, a vegetable vendor. He added that the risk of disease spread still existed at the market in the absence of thorough screening and uncontrolled entry of people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/50-of-traders-resume-business-at-palayam/article32798808.ece
08 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Call to defer mandatory permanent admission to Calicut UG courses||Demand is rife to defer the plan to have compulsory permanent admission to undergraduate (UG) courses in colleges affiliated to Calicut University until the allotment process following the Kerala Engineering Architecture Medical (KEAM) entrance test is completed. The compulsory allotment for UG courses is expected to follow the second allotment process, which began on Wednesday afternoon. Candidates are bound to take permanent admission to colleges up to October 15 by submitting transfer certificates (TCs) and remitting fees as mandated by the respective institutions. Students in a bind Permanent admission is reported to be compulsory for all students, even though they are not happy with the current allotted option. Those students who got their last option also need to complete the admission process by the deadline. Otherwise, they will lose their chance in the allotment process. However, parents point out that when students get a new option in the third allotment or community admission or go for KEAM admission, they will obviously lose the fees already paid. They will also have to get new TCs from the colleges. Apart from monetary loss, it will force students to move around offices, which is at best avoidable in the current pandemic situation, a section of teachers believes. In this context, P. Rasheed Ahmed, Syndicate member of the university, urged Vice Chancellor M.K. Jayaraj to continue the online allotment process until at least 95% of seats under the Directorate of Admissions are filled and claimed by students. Fine-tune procedures Mr. Ahmed said the procedures should be fine-tuned to serve the best interests of stakeholders. Even students who have the higher option now will be compelled to take admission in colleges. However, at least 10,000 students are likely to move away after the culmination of the KEAM allotment process. Thus, students should also be given online facilities to relinquish the admission, if they are joining other institutions. Community admission should begin only after completing at least one permanent admission. Students should be given editing facility before the second allotment, Mr. Ahmed added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-to-defer-mandatory-admission-to-ug-courses/article32798798.ece

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is slated to make an official announcement in this regard on October 10. Besides the local bodies, the Konni and Pandalam blocks in the district too will be declared as Suchitwa blocks on the occasion. The programme stipulates all local and civic bodies in the State to achieve the sanitation standards set by the State government in a phased manner. The LSGIs are accorded the sanitation status based on the criteria of public hygiene and waste management. Expert review While the local bodies can conduct the self-assessment and declare the hygiene status on their own in the first phase, a panel of experts appointed by the District Collector will review this status once again. Only those LSGIs that obtain at least 60% marks on the basis of the hygiene standards set by the State government will qualify for the final declaration. The factors considered include activities of the Haritha Karma Sena units, processing of organic and non-organic waste, public hygiene, and the steps to enforce the ban on plastic, among other things. The activities are coordinated by a team comprising district coordinators of the Haritha Keralam Mission, Suchitwa Mission, Kudumbashree Mission, Clean Kerala Company, and DDP. On a direction from the committee chairman, the team has already completed grading activities in 37 LSGIs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/37-lsgis-in-pathanamthitta-achieve-sanitation-goals/article32798884.ece

N. Raghuchandran Nair and secretary Abraham Thomas said in a letter to the Chief Minister on Wednesday. Ideally when projects are launched in any district or region they should be branded by the name of the city or district which are presently being followed in other places in the State. “Though Thiruvananthapuram is known world over, we find that there is no consistency in branding projects housed in the capital in this manner. This needs correction and renaming through your intervention,” they said. Technopark Instead of Technopark Kazhakuttam, Thiruvananthapruam, the premier IT park should be known as Technopark Thiruvananthapuram, it said. The TCCI has said the Geenfield Stadium or Sports Hub Kariyavattom should be renamed as Thiruvananthapuram International Stadium, Kariyavattom. Port The upcoming Vizhinjam International Deepwater Seaport to be renamed as Thiruvananthapuram International Deepwater Seaport, Vizhinjam. Similarly, Nemom Railway Station should be renamed as Thiruvananthapuram South and Kochuveli terminal as Thiruvananthapuram North.

Out of these, 3,800 applicants own land of their own and need only money for construction of an individual housing unit. The remaining applications are for accommodation in the flat complexes which are part of the project. In addition, another list has been prepared for housing projects under the Scheduled Caste Development Department and the Fisheries Department, both of which together have 2,265 applicants. Scrutiny In the second phase of call for applications for the LIFE project, 18,008 applications were received. Once the applications are received, it goes through scrutiny with ground visits and adalats. Following the adalat, the list of 18,008 had come down to 9,000, after eliminating ineligible applicants. Among those who applied were those who claimed that their existing houses were dilapidated, a claim which did not stand scrutiny. Out of the 9,000 applicants shortlisted, 1,304 own land. The initial number of 14,280 in the latest round is also expected to be similarly reduced after scrutiny. Close to a 1,000 families have also bought land in the city Corporation under the land purchase scheme of the LIFE project. The funds for land purchase are provided from the plan fund of the respective local body, while the LIFE Mission provides funds for the construction of houses. The State government had last year increased the funds for the land purchase scheme. Under the scheme, a family from the general category living in a municipal Corporation area will get Rs. 5.25 lakh to purchase a maximum of 3 cents of land, compared to the Rs. 2.5 lakh provided at the beginning of the scheme in 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/14280-fresh-applicants-for-life-housing-project/article32799387.ece
08 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Tracking a fly’s wind-aided migration||Migratory dragonfly Pantala flavescens has started arriving in swarms to the State. They have been spotted at Vellayani Lake here, kole farms in Thrissur, Kasaragod, and on beaches. The intercontinental migration of the dragonflies, known as Wandering Gliders, with the help of winds has always fascinated naturalists. The Society for Odonate Studies has launched an inter-continental citizen science project titled Pan Pantala Track to track their migration. A study published in 2012 has proved that these dragonflies migrate from Africa to India and back with the help of the monsoon winds. They lay eggs in temporary pools formed after the rains where their larvae grow rapidly, feeding on mosquito larvae and other small creatures. They complete four lifecycles to finish their migratory circuit. Sole claimant “It is the only regular transoceanic movement of any insect in the world. It is also the longest; the total distance travelled in a year would be more than 16,000 kilometres,” says Subramanian K.A., Scientist-E, Zoological Survey of India, who launched the project online. Although it is at present the most abundant dragonfly species in the world, it needs to be studied how it responds to the changing climate, he adds. “KoBo Toolbox, a free open-source tool for data collection using mobile phones, is used for the project. Observers can upload data from anywhere in the world", says Sujith V. Gopalan, a coordinator of the study. “We thought of starting the study in India and extending it to other countries. Already enquiries have come from Israel, South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya. We expect the project to be on a global scale soon. It will help us understand more about the grand migration.” 34 sightings Since Wednesday morning, 34 reports of spotting have reached from Bengaluru, Tiruchirappalli, Thanjavur, Coimbatore, Kasaragod, Kannur, Thrissur, Kozhikode, Ernakulam, Kottayam, and Thiruvananthapuram. “We have reports of more than 1,000 wandering gliders,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tracking-a-flys-wind-aided-migration/article32799376.ece

Athijeevanam is being implemented as part of the 100-day action plan of the government. One of the 100 components of action plan is creating livelihood opportunities for 50,000 people. Athijeevanam is being organised as part of the Local Employment Assurance Programme (LEAP) of the government that aims at finding livelihood for at least five persons in every local self-government institution. Launched on September 25, this mission mode campaign will come to an end on October 15. Creating awareness of Athijeevanam in all neighbourhood groups and making those interested to register online is under way. So far, nearly 12,000 people have registered.  Orientation training The registration is followed by a general orientation training on the opportunities available. This has kicked off in some districts. Once the training is completed, a two-day ‘Entrepreneurship Development Programme’ will be organised on the various enterprises and how to start them. Classes on each sector will follow. These will give an idea about the interests of each person, and accordingly, skill training will be provided to them. They will also be made familiar with the various kinds of support provided by the Kudumbashree. Microenterprise conveners, area development society (ADS) members, and resource persons will explain the subject at neighbourhood group meetings. Some of the areas that the Kudumbashree is focussing on include Janakeeya hotels. Of the targeted 1,000 hotels, 700 have started. The remaining too will be started in panchayats. Launch of Kudumbashree’s multi-task teams as part of the Arise project in every panchayat or block is another focus area. Santhwanam for health check-ups at home is another sector that is under consideration. Kudumbashree is also trying to trace people who have received training in the past but have not started any ventures so that they can be provided support to start these.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kudumbashree-drive-to-create-15000-jobs/article32799379.ece

08 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Cabinet clearance for farmers’ welfare board||The Cabinet on Wednesday gave its nod for the formation of the Kerala Farmers’ Welfare Fund Board which entitles farmers to a slew of benefits, including pension and medical assistance. With the formation of the board, an ‘agricultural incentive’ will be collected from the profits generated from the sale of value-added products made from agricultural produce. The board is the first of its kind in the country, Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar said. P. Rajendran, former Vice Chancellor, Kerala Agricultural University, has been appointed chairman of the board. The Cabinet also approved a director board consisting of eight directors and 14 non-official directors. The rules for the board are expected to be cleared in the next Cabinet meeting. The Kerala Farmers’ Welfare Fund Act was passed by the Assembly on December 20, 2019. What it entails Any farmer who has reached the age of 18 and who is below 55 years can apply for membership. The other conditions are: they should possess not less than 5 cents and not exceeding 15 acres, have an annual income below Rs. 5 lakh, and the principal means of livelihood should have been farming for at least three years. Members need to pay a contribution not less than Rs. 100 per month. The government will remit an equivalent amount for contributions up to Rs. 250. Once the farmer reaches the age of 60, he/she will be entitled to pension corresponding to the contribution remitted. Apart from medical assistance, the welfare fund provides for family pension, death benefits and financial assistance to members who sustain permanent disability due to ailments or accidents. Other benefits include marriage and educational assistance for the children of farmers. Agricultural incentive The agricultural incentive, as required by the Act, forms an important component of the welfare fund board. “Traders who sell value-added products developed from agricultural produce must pay 1% of their annual profits as agricultural incentive to the welfare fund. This, however, is not applicable to traders whose annual profits are less than Rs. 1 lakh,” he said. The Minister said the government would soon approach the Supreme Court against the contentious farm laws introduced by the Centre. The matter is currently under the scrutiny of the Law Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cabinet-clearance-for-farmers-welfare-board/article32798912.ece

Nair. The other accused in the case are women’s rights activist Diya Sana and Sree Lakshmi Arackal. The Thampanoor police had registered a case against the trio based on a complaint filed by Mr. Nair. He alleged that the women had barged into his room and battered him. The attack was termed as an illegal act of personal payback against Mr. Nair for ‘uploading’ a slanderous video about Ms. Bhagyalakshmi on his widely watched blog. They allegedly used obscene language against him and stole his laptop and mobile phone. Mr. Nair accused the women of having recorded the assault on their mobile cameras. They, later, broadcast the footage on social media and television news channels, he said. The police told the court that granting anticipatory bail to the women on bail would tantamount to encouraging vigilantism in society. The district court here will give its ruling on Friday. The police had arrested Mr. Nair on the charge of defaming women.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-oppose-artistes-anticipatory-bail-plea/article32799378.ece

The direction comes in the wake of an order issued by the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights in late 2018. The commission was acting on a complaint pertaining to mental harassment of students in the name of 100% results and getting A+ grade. The complaint by P.K. Sreedevi, a retired teacher, said the rank system was abandoned in favour of grades to protect children from unnecessary competition. However, it was pressuring them in the name of 100% results and getting A+, with children being discriminated against. The complaint alleged that schools were getting Inclusive Education for the Disabled certificates for academically backward students and making them sit for exams with the help of scribes or making students sit in separate class and being taught only what was needed to clear the exams. This led to loss of confidence among them and put them under stress. Publicity in the media for schools who did well led to intense competition. In its report to the commission, the department said children were taught in separate classes according to their academic ability for their good. A number of programmes were needed for such students and these had to be seen not as harassment but attempts to bring them into mainstream education.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/directive-to-schools/article32798894.ece

Within hours of a post that talked about an alleged desecration of a Saraswati idol on the premises of Krishnaveni College in Narsaraopet, the police tracked the origin of the post and nabbed a person from Piduguralla. Addressing mediapersons, Superintendent of Police, Guntur Rural, Vishal Gunni said a message on the WhatsApp number of an Inspector at Piduguralla on the alleged incident prompted the police into the action immediately. The Inspector, after sensing that some thing was amiss, forwarded the message to Inspector of Narsaraopet, who then went to the college. It had emerged that the site had been leased out to Krishnaveni College some 10 years back and it was during the renovation/construction of new buildings taken up two years back, that the idol was partially damaged. The Inspector then started investigation and it led to a man in Piduguralla, who reportedly admitted that he had forwarded a message he received on his mobile phone. Note of caution for WhatsApp users “We are sounding a note of caution to people. These days, when usage of mobile phones has increased considerably, we urge people to be very careful while dealing with messages that can cause communal tension. Even if they innocuously forward such messages, they are liable to be punished under the relevant sections of law,’’ said Mr. Gunni. Further, Mr. Gunni said that 4,300 religious places had been thoroughly searched across Guntur Rural district in view of the incidents across the State. “Such incidents appear to be the handiwork of some miscreants or a group, bent on creating a law and order problems in the State and the police will crack down mercilessly on such elements,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/man-behind-troll-on-idol-desecration-held/article32798640.ece

08 October 2020||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||A.P.’s demand for revenue deficit grant has to be discussed, says Sitharaman||Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Wednesday that the Andhra Pradesh government’s demand for revenue deficit grant was to be discussed as it was a matter in the purview of the 14th Finance Commission whose term had expired. “The Ministry of Finance has to work on it, considering that the amount being claimed by the State is based on the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission. The 15th Finance Commission has already submitted its first year’s report and it is under implementation,” Ms. Sitharaman told the media here. Ms. Sitharaman said she was not sure about the revenue deficit amount due to the State, which had every right to question why the matter had not been sorted out yet. ‘Economy on recovery path’ She, however, avoided a proper reply to a question on the demand for Special Category Status (SCS) by saying that she would answer if she had one. Referring to GST, Ms. Sitharaman said that the GST Council had decided that the compensation cess collection could go beyond five years, whereas it was originally supposed to be for the five-year transition period. Ms. Sitharaman said the economy was on the path to recovery going by the feedback she received from the States about the positivity in some high-frequency indicators and from industrialists, who told her they had almost reached the pre-COVID capacity utilisation levels. ‘Farmers happy with new laws’ Speaking on the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation), Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Acts, 2020, Ms. Sitharaman said that farmers were happy that certain taxes that cut into their meagre returns were eliminated and inter-State trade was made hassle-free. The Centre did not meddle with the Agricultural Produce Market Committees, which were the domain of the States, and it was not going about contact farming in a roughshod manner lest the relevant laws should become counterproductive, she said, adding that the opposition parties were doing politics as usual after wasting an opportunity to engage with the government in a meaningful debateon the floors of Parliament. Earlier in the day , Ms. Sitharaman had an interaction with the farmers at Jakkula Nekkalam village near Gannavaram on the three new laws and received a representation from the Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi on the capital issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/economy-on-recovery-path-says-nirmala-sitharaman/article32798539.ece

They said that the farmers of Amaravati region had given 33,000 acres for construction of the capital.

Informing Ms. Sitharaman that the farmers of Jakkula Nekkalam, Gudavalli, Kesarapalli and Nidamanuru villages cultivated paddy and sugarcane, they explained her their difficulty in selling the produce as there were obstacles that needed to be removed. Pointing out that labour cost had gone up, they said banks denied them loans, which further compounded their woes. The farmers appealed to the Union Finance Minister to ensure immediate steps for payment of Rs. 2,000 per quintal as support price for paddy. The Union Minister was accompanied by BJP leaders Kanna Lakshminarayana and P.V.N.

08 October 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Talks between A.P. and TS RTCs remain inconclusive||Yet another round of talks between officials of the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation and their Telangana counterparts in Hyderabad Bus Bhavan on Wednesday remained inconclusive. Inter-State bus operations between the two States had stopped in the last seven months on account of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic situation. The APSRTC is eager to resume operations to the neighbouring State, especially in view of the Dasara festivities, a time when there is heavy traffic of people travelling between the two States. “In the name of route parity, they want too many advantages, compromising the interests of the APSRTC,” said a top official who was part of the talks. APSRTC buses operate in 1.4 lakh km on the Hyderabad-Vijayawada-Garikapadu route while TSRTC operates in 33,000 km. “They now want parity for 67,000 km on the Vijayawada-Hyderabad route without they having to touch interior areas of Andhra Pradesh,” said the official. He said the Telangana RTC wanted sector-wise benefit. “In the name of parity, they are asking for something else,” he said. Though a solution to the deadlock does not seem easy to come by, the APSRTC officials want to operate buses to Telangana on a temporary basis till March 2021, without waiting for a permanent settlement on the inter-State bus operations between the two States. “We will send our proposals to the TSRTC in a couple of days with a hope that both sides will sort out the differences at the earliest,” said the official.

Ms. Sitharaman said the biggest advantage for the farmers was the facility to sell their produce anywhere in the country, devoid of any interference by the middlemen. She alleged that the Congress party wanted to disband the Agricultural Produce Market Committees and even included it in its election manifesto. Certain amendments made to the Essential Commodities Act would be of great help to the farmers who bore the brunt of the vagaries of the market.

The aggrieved Adivasis, including several women and children, traversed a distance of about 15 km on foot and reached the residence of Kothagudem MLA Vanama Venkateshwara Rao in pursuit of their demand, sources said. A host of leaders of various Adivasi organisations extended their support to the protest march on Wednesday. The demonstrators raised slogans against the removal of their huts at Prashantinagar by the Revenue staff on September 29 rendering them shelterless in these turbulent times of the COVID-19 pandemic. They alleged that the authorities concerned failed to provide them house sites/double bedroom houses despite their repeated pleas for a roof over their heads several times in the past. The angry protesters deplored that their huts were removed in a ‘pre-dawn’ eviction drive ‘mercilessly’, leaving them homeless and aggravating their livelihood issues. Instead of addressing the problems of homeless Adivasis, the persons at the helm of affairs are trying to foist cases against those demanding their right to shelter, the protesters alleged. They said they would launch an intensive agitation again if the authorities concerned failed to provide them the alternative houses in their Gram Panchayat (GP) limits. Meanwhile, the demonstrators met Mr. Venkateshwara Rao near his residence at Palvancha and narrated their tale of woe to him later in the day. The MLA reportedly assured to look into their grievances.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/evicted-adivasis-take-out-rally-demand-reconstruction-of-huts/article32799248.ece
08 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||KCR demands tough action against forest smugglers||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, on Wednesday, directed Home and Forest departments’ officials to take stern action against those plundering forest wealth. “Timber smuggling has become an easy business for vested interests because of the negligent attitude of previous governments. The government has, however, taken a serious note of the malice since the formation of the separate State,” he said. Accordingly, the CM directed the civilian police to forge effective coordination with the Forest department to stop smuggling of forest wealth. Mr. Rao was speaking at a high-level meeting of senior officials of Police and Forest departments here on Wednesday. He said that the State was ahead of all others in terms of maintenance of law and order situation and this could be achieved with the help of police officials at different levels. “There is a need for officials concerned to continue their good work for maintaining law and other situation in the State,” he said. In this context, he added that police personnel should actively participate in the Telanganaku Harita Haram programme so that they could spread awareness about conservation of forest wealth among the general public which, in turn, would help in controlling smuggling. Forest department officials have been directed to coordinate with the police in this direction. “Officials of the two departments should conduct coordination meetings and prepare an action plan to curb timber smuggling,” he said. He told the police to deal firmly with those indulging in preparation of fake certificates as reports on the existence of such rackets would send wrong signals. Officials should focus on nabbing the gangs indulging in producing fake certificates and stringent action should be initiated against those found guilty. About policemen retiring from service, he said that there should not be any delays in making appointments on compassionate grounds. Every eligible member of the family of a deceased should be given jobs based on their qualifications and the department should prepare an action plan in this regard at the earliest. The Chief Minister directed Director General of Police M. Mahender Reddy to find out whether there were any vacancies in other departments so that they could be filled by candidates in the waiting list. Recalling that the government was implementing 33% reservation for women, Mr. Rao said facilities for women employees should accordingly be created in all the police stations. The Chief Minister exhorted the department to leverage advancements in technology to control crime. The department should also speed up the process of setting up 10 lakh CCTV cameras in Hyderabad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/demands-tough-action-against-forest-smugglers/article32799250.ece

08 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||SCR strengthening infra to run trains at 130 kmph||South Central Railway (SCR) has taken up the task of upgrading maximum permissible speed in the sections of ‘Golden Quadrilateral/Golden Diagonal (GQ/GD) routes’ including the sections of Balharshah - Kazipet - Vijayawada - Gudur, Vijayawada- Visakhapatnam and Wadi- Gooty - Renigunta sections to 130 kmph. Existing maximum permissible speed between Balharshah - Kazipet - Vijayawada and Kazipet -Secunderabad is about 120 kmph, while it is 110 kmph between Vijayawada - Gudur and Wadi -Gooty - Renigunta sections. These routes are under the process of speed upgradation up to 130 kmph as decided by the Railway Board, informed General Manager Gajanan Mallya on Wednesday. Railway Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO/Lucknow) had already conducted ‘oscillation trials’ through ‘Confirmatory Oscillograph Car Run’ (COCR) consisting of 24 coaches of all classes. During this check, the engineering teams travelling in these special inspection trains check for the signalling, traction distribution equipment, locomotive and coach fitness. Trial runs were conducted in July between Balharshah - Kazipet - Secunderabad and Gooty - Renigunta sections. Works pertaining to upgradation of these routes to required standards like sturdier rails, improvement of curves, gradients and other components in double line electrified routes are under way, he said. Chief Public Relations Officer (CPRO) Ch. Rakesh said about 260-metres-long welded rail panels are being laid to improve track structure. Trial runs are also being carried out in the remaining sections of Kazipet - Vijayawada - Gudur & Wadi - Gooty sections with the track strengthening and other infrastructure enhancement already in progress to meet the specified standards. Once all the infrastructure improvements are done, a detailed report will be sent to the Commissioner of Railway Safety (Secunderabad circle) for getting necessary permissions to enhance the maximum permissible speed of all these routes to 130 kmph. Mr. Mallya pointed out that increasing the trains speed in these important sections of Golden Quadrilateral/Golden Diagonal routes will definitely boost the operation of passenger and freight trains. “As the running time of the passenger services can be drastically reduced, it will pave the way for running more number of trains,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/scr-strengthening-infra-to-run-trains-at-130-kmph/article32799362.ece
08 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Cong. fears enrolment with fake certificates for MLC polls||Telangana Congress is apprehensive of the enrolment of bogus voters using fake degree certificates for the upcoming Graduate MLC elections and urged election officials, on Wednesday, to put in place a strong mechanism to verify the certificates physically. Memorandum to SEC In a memorandum to the State Election Commissioner (SEC), chairman Marri Shashidhar Reddy and convenor G. Niranjan of the TPCC Election Commission Coordination Committee said that since voters were being asked to enrol online and upload their degree certificates, there was a greater chance of misuse and fake certificates used for enrolment. They alleged that the ruling TRS was desperate to win the elections and going by the previous experiences, there was a greater chance of such fake voters emerging. They alleged that TRS has a ‘dubious distinction’ of tinkering with the purity of electoral rolls right from 2015 onwards. The Congress reminded that their fear has some credence given the fact that since 2014 there were several instances of “fake degree certificate rackets” exposed by the police. As promised by the officials at the all-party meeting on October 3, they demanded a door-to-door verification by officials. At the same time the qualification of the verification staff should be checked as the government had earlier hired sweepers, sanitary inspectors, lift operators and in some cases, even auto drivers, for such a job, it charged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cong-fears-enrolment-with-fake-certificates-for-mlc-polls/article32799239.ece

However, it has not clarified its stand on whether meters would be installed for the over 25 lakh agricultural pumpsets, entitled for free power supply. “Putting the blame on the Centre, the AP government has started installing meters to agricultural connections. Telangana government should instil confidence among farmers by making an announcement that the meters will not be installed,” Mr. Raghavulu said. He suggested that CM K.

Obesity, co-morbidities The female patient, who is obese, was admitted in the ICU of the hospital on September 16. She had co-morbid illness in the form of diabetes. As the patient was not maintaining oxygen levels above 70% with high oxygen supports, doctors team decided to escalate to mechanical ventilator. “Even on ventilator support, her oxygen levels were fluctuating between 80% and 90%. At this juncture, the team of doctors discussed with the family members and with their consent, ECMO treatment was initiated from September 19. With that, oxygenation improved,” informed a press release from the hospital. Besides, her left lung had suddenly collapsed due to obstruction by a mucus plug and added bacterial infection. The team of doctors decided to do an urgent bronchoscopy and were able to clear off the mucus and re-opened the lungs. Following this, patient improved and removed from ECMO on September 28. “She was discharged on October 5 on tracheotomy to a rehabilitation centre, where she will undergo rigorous physical training and will be shifted home,” said Dr. G. Hari Kishan, senior pulmonologist at the corporate hospital.  Even on ventilator support, her oxygen levels were fluctuating between 80% and 90%. With ECMO treatment, oxygenation improved.

08 October 2020||New Delhi,||Delhi cinema halls to open from October 15||Cinema halls and weekly markets will be allowed to reopen in the Capital according to the latest unlock guidelines issued by the Centre, said an order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday. The order, dated October 6, and released in the name of Delhi Chief Secretary Vijay Dev, stated that theatres can open from October 15 with 50% capacity while all weekly markets can open with immediate effect. The relaxations do not apply to containment zones. The Delhi government attributed the order to the ‘persistent efforts’ of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. “Now all weekly markets of Delhi will open. Till now only two markets per zone were allowed. The poor will get a lot of relief from this. Cinema halls of Delhi will also be opened from October 15. They have to follow all the guidelines issued by the Central government,” Mr. Kejriwal tweeted. Earlier, the DDMA had ordered a status quo regarding relaxation of restrictions in the city.  SOP compliance The reopening of cinema halls will be subject to “strict compliance” of the SOP for Exhibition of Films on preventive measures to contain spread of COVID-19, as well as other directions/instructions issued by the Delhi government and the DDMA. The functioning of weekly markets in the city will also be subject to strict compliance of preventive measures, read the order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-cinema-halls-to-open-from-october-15/article32799216.ece
08 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Police reveal details of protected witnesses in riot case chargesheet||Delhi Police has revealed the names and addresses of 15 protected witnesses in the chargesheet they submitted in the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act case registered in connection with the Delhi riots that broke out in February. Police said the act was “inadvertent”. Delhi Police Spokesperson said: “During the course of investigation, it was deemed necessary that the identities of some witnesses should not be disclosed in the public domain. However, a court-related document containing the identities of some of these witnesses has been inadvertently included in the copies of the chargesheet provided to the accused persons as part of compliance of judicial orders.” Ensure safety Police further said that the witnesses are court-protected and steps are being taken to ensure the safety and security of these witnesses and “to address all concerns in this regard”. Special Cell had submitted the chargesheet in court in the third week of September, which was further submitted to accused’s lawyers a few days later. The document on 15 public witnesses, including four Hindus and 11 Muslims, mentions their names along with addresses against their pseudonym and dates on which their statements were recorded before the police and the magistrate. The pseudonyms given include Omega, Victor, Charlie, Gama, Delta, Echo among others. The document also states that the identities of these public witnesses be concealed during the proceedings of the case. The 17,000 page chargesheet divided into different folders was filed against 15 persons. For six persons who were charged under the UAPA, including Sharjeel Imam and Umar Khalid, a supplementary chargesheet will be filed in due course.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/police-reveal-details-of-protected-witnesses-in-riot-case-chargesheet/article32798966.ece
08 October 2020||New Delhi,||Next three months crucial in Capital’s COVID fight: report||A report prepared by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says “the next three months are crucial in our battle” against COVID-19 with multiple festivals such as Diwali, Chhath Puja, Dussehra, and Id lined up. The report says 2,324 healthcare workers in the Capital have been infected by COVID-19 and 75 have died so far. Out of the 2,324 cases, 34% are nurses, 23% doctors, 15% paramedics, 18% Group D staff and 10% others, according to the report. “The increasing mortality in HCW (healthcare workers) and doctors is detrimental for maintaining the morale of these COVID warriors. Hence all efforts should be undertaken to prevent the healthcare-associated infection in all the hospitals, labs, and field workers,” states the report. Containment zones The report states that the percentage of cases from containment zones varied from 15-20% in districts and 80% were outside the zones. Of the total positive people, 30% were in different government facilities and 50-55% were in home isolation. “Formation of new containment zones could be restricted only for highly dense localities such as resettlement colonies and JJ clusters/slum areas,” says the report. If the government considers this recommendation, then this could greatly change the number of containment zones in the city. The report also states that home isolation was observed in “densely populated areas” as well and with the number of cases in thousands, this “may be one of the reasons for the spread of infection”. “All symptomatic positive cases reported from densely populated areas should be isolated only in CCC (COVID Care Centre) to ensure optimal utilization of CCC facilities,” the report recommends.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/next-three-months-crucial-in-capitals-covid-fight-report/article32799217.ece
08 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Transcript collection long drawn out, say DU graduates||Delhi University graduates, who queued up at the South Campus on Wednesday to collect transcripts, complained of the process being long drawn and time-consuming specially with several of them applying to universities abroad. Stating that one is required to visit the centre “at least four to five times” before the transcript is ready, they also complained of the lack of information on the varsity’s website regarding the process. While last month the university had informed the Delhi High Court that it was “willing to devise a mechanism for urgent requests,” several of those lined up at the centre were unaware of the direction. Vaani Sharma (name changed), who graduated from Lady Shri Ram College in 2018, said: “I have not looked up for the online method yet and anyway DU has been fairly unreliable with technology. This is the fourth time I am coming to this centre. The list of documents provided is also vague and everyday they ask for a new document.” The Lucknow resident added: “There is a lot of miscommunication. Nowhere on the website is it mentioned that the centre will remain open on alternate days. I visited the centre on Tuesday only to find it shut. This is very difficult for someone like me who is not a city resident.” Multiple trips For Anil Kumar, a resident of Palam, who was at the window to collect his son’s transcript, it was his fifth visit. “My son graduated from Ram Lal Anand college in 2013 and now we need the transcript as he is applying abroad. Nothing seems to move here unless one makes multiple trips. If we are coming after a month to collect it, then at least keep the thing ready. Usually transcripts are needed urgently. What is the point of making someone wait for two months?” Mr. Kumar added, “Even government work is done online these days. Instead here we wait endlessly.” Vandana Sapra, who graduated from Sri Venkateswara college in 2019 said: “As of now I have not come across any online mode. I paid the fees online but for submission and attestation of documents we had to come to the campus. It has been a month since I paid the fees and now I have been asked to wait for sometime before I can collect the transcript.” Saloni Singh (name changed) waiting for her daughter’s transcript added: “My daughter, who graduated in 2018, studied life sciences and now wants to apply abroad. We live in north Delhi and it is a hassle to keep making trips to South Campus for the transcript. But we do not have any other option at the moment. We are also not aware of any provision to apply for online transcripts and hence did not apply for the same.” In its affidavit to the Delhi HC, the university had said that an online mechanism could not be devised for those who graduated before 2017 as printing of degrees had already been undertaken and sent to the respective colleges. High Court order The HC in its September 28 order had said, “Let the mechanism devised for issuance of urgent transcripts and the details thereof be placed on record before the next date of hearing.” The varsity had also informed the court that out of a total of 1,788 applications received with an urgency request, 1,728 degree certificates had already been issued and 450 online degree certificates are being generated on a daily basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/transcript-collection-long-drawn-out-say-du-graduates/article32798971.ece
08 October 2020||New Delhi,||Retired Lt. Colonel arrested for duping armymen of Rs. 88 lakh||A retired Lt. Colonel was arrested for allegedly cheating army personnel on the pretext of providing them residential plots, the police said on Wednesday. The accused has been identified as Rakesh Rana, a resident of Dwarka’s Sector-18A. He was previously involved in two criminal cases, they said. The police said one Havaldar Chandan Kumar, along with other army personnel, alleged that they have been cheated by SWO-India Ltd., to the tune of around Rs. 88 lakh. They alleged that the accused showed them rosy pictures of the ‘Veer Aawas Bokaro Project’ and assured that they were running an NGO in the name of SWO-India for the benefit of army personnel. It was also told that no-profit motive was there in the projects. The investors were asked to deposit money in SWO India Ltd. The company, through its official, ensured that they would provide residential plots to the investors at Bokaro in Jharkhand, the police said. Assured by the accused, the victims invested money in the plots. During investigation, it was revealed that Rana induced the army personnel that the whole project was on a 20-acre land and the land had been purchased and necessary approvals had been taken, a senior police officer said. The company provided an allocation-letter-cum-agreement on the receipt of the total amount, but it neither provided the plots, nor returned their money. Even the company has no land and requisite approval from authority concerned, the police said. “During investigation, it was revealed that Rana, retired Lt. Colonel, Kirti Chakra Vijeta, was the mastermind. He was arrested on Tuesday from one of his residences at Dwarka. He was also the authorised signatory of various accounts of the company,” Joint CP (EOW) O.P. Mishra said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/retired-lt-colonel-arrested-for-duping-armymen-of-rs-88-lakh/article32798967.ece

08 October 2020||New Delhi,||Special Marriage Act: interfaith pair seek removal of objection provision||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought a response from the Union government on a petition by an interfaith couple seeking to do away with the provision of inviting objection from public while applying for marriage registration under the Special Marriage Act (SMA). A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan also issued notice to the Delhi government on the petition. The couple, currently housed at an NGO here, have sought their marriage to be registered immediately. All marriages done under the SMA require publication of the names of the couple for inviting objections from the public for 30 days. Within this period, anyone can object to the marriage on the ground that it would contravene one or more of the conditions specified in Section 4 of the SMA.  The petition stated that the 30-day gestation period was not warranted as the same objective could be mitigated on the basis of certificates issued by government hospitals and on the basis of an undertaking by them. The question with regard to whether either party had a living spouse could arise in other religious marriage also, but they were exempted from the 30-day notice period, advocate, Utkarsh Singh, for the couple, argued. The petition sought to quash Section 6 and 7 of the SMA, which mandate the publication of the public notice, on the ground that it was unreasonable and arbitrary. It claimed that the law commission had urged a reduction of this period to bring the procedure in line with all other personal laws, where registration under the Hindu Marriage Act could be attained in a day and signing of a ‘Nikahnama’ also conferred the status of husband and wife on a couple immediately. “The 30-day period offers an opportunity to the kin of a couple to discourage an inter-caste or inter-religion marriage”, it said. The relationship of the 28-year-old Hindu man and the 26-year-old Muslim woman had led to various difficulties, with resistance from their respective parents, Mr. Singh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/special-marriage-act-interfaith-pair-seek-removal-of-objection-provision/article32798960.ece

The petition is likely to come up for hearing before Justice Yogesh Khanna on Thursday. The trial court had on August 26 rejected her plea for registration of FIR against the BJP leaders on the ground that the requisite sanction from the competent authority, the Central government, was not obtained. The trial court had stated that prior sanction of competent authority – Central government – is required as per section 196 the Code of Criminal Procedure at the stage of ordering of registration of FIR as both Mr. Thakur and Mr. Verma are MPs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/karat-moves-court-over-hate-speeches-issue/article32798959.ece
08 October 2020||New Delhi,||Delhi HC declines plea on guidelines on tuition fee||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday declined a petition seeking guidelines to universities and such institutions to charge only the tuition fee, that too in instalments, in view of the COVID-19 crisis. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan asked the authorities concerned to treat the plea as a representation and take a decision in accordance with law and government policy applicable to the facts of the case. The Bench said that universities have to pay their professors and also set up the infrastructure for online classes and therefore, they cannot be directed to grant fee concessions. “Such petition deserves to be dismissed with costs, but we are not doing it now,” the Bench said while disposing of the plea. The law student, in his plea, had sought directions from the Ministry of Education to various universities and such institutions to give a break-up of the fees being charged by them and to also grant concessions to parents on a case-to-case basis in the form of extension of time period to deposit the fees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-hc-declines-plea-on-guidelines-on-tuition-fee/article32798963.ece
08 October 2020||New Delhi,||Season’s debut for ‘poor’ AQI||The air quality of the Capital dropped to “poor” category on Wednesday for the first time this season, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. “The AQI [Air Quality Index] is forecast to deteriorate for the next three days and remain in poor category with increasing magnitude until October 10,” government-run monitoring agency SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research) said in a statement. Fire counts aggregated over Punjab, Haryana, and neighbouring border regions were 336 on Tuesday. Also, the boundary layer wind direction and speed are favourable for slow transport from external emission sources to the city and local conditions are also conducive for accumulation of pollutants in the city, as per SAFAR. The AQI of the city was 215 on Wednesday as per CPCB. The AQI was in the moderate category till Tuesday and was expected to drop to the poor category this week. Strict actions Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday said that there will be strict implementation of anti-dust drive to control air pollution.

Justice Jayant Nath asked the poll panel to respond to Mr. Shekhar’s plea seeking to reduce the mandatory 30-day period for inviting objections from the public before registration of his party to seven days.

Meanwhile, the Election Commission announced the dates for Bihar election, with the first phase to begin from October 28. In the petition filed through advocate Mohan Shyam Arya, Mr. Shekhar said that his party will contest the Bihar election on all seats.

08 October 2020||Navi Mumbai,||Crime Branch arrests duo for trying to sell ‘piece of comet’||Two men who allegedly tried to sell a piece of ‘stone’ to a resident of Panvel claiming it to be part of a ‘comet’ that fell on earth and was in demand by international scientists were arrested by the Navi Mumbai Crime Branch. Acccording to the police, the duo were identified as Afsar Taayar Ali Sayyed (35) from Bhiwandi and Popat Kashinath Khomane (51) from Nerul. James William George (49) from Panvel was introduced to Mr. Khomane two months ago via a relative. Mr. Khomane, after winning Mr. George’s confidence, one day asked to meet him at Airoli bus depot for some important work. Mr. George, who works as a supervisor at a logistics firm in Mumbai met Mr. Khomane, who showed him a picture and said that it was a ‘piece of comet’ worth Rs. 25 crore in international market. Mr. Khomane told Mr. George that he knew of a person who had it and he would be selling it for Rs. 20 lakh as he was not aware of its international price. Mr. Khomane further said that since he did not have the money, Mr. George should buy it and he would help him further sell it for Rs. 25 crore from which he would take his share of Rs. 3 crore to repay his loans. After Mr. George agreed, Mr. Sayyed was introduced to him as a scientist in possession of the ‘comet piece’, who also showed him a silver colour object in a suitcase. “The accused kept a clock over the ‘stone’ which stopped working. The accused claimed that it was because of the radiation,” senior police inspector Subhash Nikam, Crime Branch Unit I, said. As a token money, Mr. George paid Rs. 1 lakh to Mr. Sayyed. The accused then poured some water on the ‘stone’ following which smoke came out of it. The accused claimed that the ‘stone’ had started emitting high radiation and it was not safe to keep it exposed any longer and left after closing the suitcase. Later, Mr. George discussed this with a friend who told him that no such thing existed and it would be a fraud. When Mr. George asked Mr. Khomane for his money, he refused to return. Mr. George then lodged a complaint at Rabale police station. On the pretext of paying the rest of the money, Mr. George called Mr. Khomane and Mr. Sayyed to meet, while Crime Branch officials laid a trap and nabbed the duo on October 3. “The accused are in custody till October 8. The accused had wrapped a ball of cotton with aluminium foil and copper and made the ‘comet piece’ appear very strange to make it look believable,” assistant police inspector Rahul Rakh from Crime Branch Unit I said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/crime-branch-arrests-duo-for-trying-to-sell-piece-of-comet/article32798873.ece

Main initiatives In the last five years, the Delhi government had taken several measures to tackle the twin problems, which had resulted in a reduction in pollution by 25% on the average PM 2.5 level, said the Chief Minister. “Some of the main initiatives we took to control this and respond to the climate emergency are introducing odd-even schemes, shutting down of thermal power plants, banning the use of polluting fuels, and starting a mega green drive,” he said in his address. “Delhi is the only city/State in India that has shut down all thermal power plants. Today, we have no coal-based, polluting power plants. We are trying to make a big shift towards renewable energy to address the crisis of climate change and pollution. Last year, we shut down one more thermal power plant. The 45-acre land on which it was located will be used to develop a solar park that will produce 5 MW of electricity,” he also said. Under the mega green drive, he said, the Delhi government planted more than 3.6 million saplings in 2019-20 and Delhi’s green cover was continuously increasing. In an effort to devise sustainable solutions to crop stubble burning, he said, the Delhi government had joined hands with the Indian Agricultural Research Institute to bring in the bio-decomposer technique. “This year, we are promoting an innovative sustainable technique called the bio decomposer which involves making a liquid solution and spraying it on the crop stubble. This zero-emission solution will help greatly to reduce carbon emissions,” he said. The Delhi government is also promoting public and non-motorised public transport, he said and the important focus in the next five years would be to double the fleet of public buses and develop a widely accessible, affordable, and integrated public transport system in Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/kejriwal-highlights-efforts-to-tackle-climate-change/article32798857.ece
08 October 2020||New Delhi,||No problem in reclaiming 90 hectares: SC on coastal road||The Supreme Court on Wednesday indicated it may not see a problem with the reclamation of 90 hectares for the Coastal Road Project in Mumbai, but the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) would have to take CRZ clearance for reclaiming anything more. “We see no problem with the 90 hectare, but anything above 90, you will have to get CRZ clearance... Stick to 90,” Chief Justice S.A. Bobde orally suggested to BMC counsel Darius Khambata. He in turn informed the court that his client has already made an application before the Maharashtra CRZ. Senior advocate Shyam Divan, representing respondents led by Worli Koliwada Nakhwa Matsya Vyavasay Sakhari Society, however said the increase in land reclamation from 90 hectares to 111.5 hectares has transformed the project. “It is a completely different project now... They have completely altered it,” Mr. Divan argued. He sought a blanket stay of the project. The Bench reserved orders on the issue. The court is hearing an appeal filed against a Bombay High Court decision stopping work on the project till it gets a proper environmental clearance. On December 17 last year, the apex court found that the high court order “needs to be stayed having regard to the factor of balance of convenience; prima facie case and irreparable damage/injury”. The apex court had said the petitioners were “free to reclaim the land, build the road thereon and secure the road. They shall however not carry out any other development work until further orders of this court”. The various local societies have contended that “the project is not just about a road. It touches on 90 hectares. The road is only a tiny stretch but large areas of land would be reclaimed”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/no-problem-in-reclaiming-90-hectares-sc-on-coastal-road/article32798869.ece
08 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||CPCB points to lacunae in Delhi’s pollution plan||The Central Pollution Control Board has pointed out several “shortcomings” in Delhi’s pollution control plan, according to a letter by the agency’s head to the Delhi government viewed by The Hindu . The CPCB deployed teams from September 15-21 in known pollution hotspots in the city to check if regulations were being enforced against activities such as dumping of construction and demolition (C&D) waste, whether dust mitigation measures were being undertaken and conducting random audits of pollution-under-control certificates. Among the lacunae pointed out were that nearly 40% of complaints by citizens posted via the SAMEER app — designed specifically for consumer complaints — were unattended. Thirteen of the most polluted hotspots were expected to furnish action plans and Wazirpur had yet to provide one. The Delhi Jal Board, Public Works Department and Irrigation and Food and Control Department also hadn’t furnished their ‘winter action plans’ and mixed municipal solid waste at the dumpsites in Bhalswa, Ghazipur and Okhla. Nearly all major districts were reporting instances of wanton dumping of C&D waste, roads left unpaved, open burning of garbage, traffic congestion and industrial emissions. ‘More needs to be done’ “Some tasks to curb air pollution in Delhi have been accomplished but more needs to be done,” says the letter signed by Shiv Das Meena, chairman, CPCB and addressed to Vijay Kumar Dev, Chief Secretary, Delhi. On Monday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the Delhi government would be creating a ‘24x7 war room’. A key prong this year was the use of the bio-decomposer technique developed by the PUSA research institute which the Delhi government will be taking to farmers’ doorsteps from Tuesday. “We have also delineated 13 pollution hotspots for which detailed and specific plans will be made. We are creating the ‘Green Delhi’ app, which will receive complaints of pollution that will be need to be taken care in a time-bound manner,” he had said on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cpcb-points-to-lacunae-in-delhis-pollution-plan/article32798850.ece
08 October 2020||New Delhi,||Hindu Rao doctors go on strike over salary||Resident doctors at the civic body run Hindu Rao Hospital in north Delhi have resorted to a three-hour daily “symbolic indefinite strike” in response to the non-payment of salaries for the last three months. The group of doctors was joined by nurses of the hospital, who too have not been paid their salaries for several months. Hindu Rao Hospital, the largest municipal hospital in Delhi with 900 beds, is currently a dedicated COVID-19 facility and many of its healthcare workers have contracted the virus since the pandemic began. Since it is a dedicated COVID-19 facility, medical services, according to the striking medical workers, will not be essentially affected. Doctors, who are not on rotational duty, will join the strike for the three hour duration, they said. “We are on a symbolic indefinite strike to make our voices heard to authorities, who have not responded to our appeal so far. We have been doing the symbolic pen down from 9 a.m. to noon for the last several days as well as online protests, but no one listened to us,” said Abhimanyu Sardana, president of the Resident Doctors’ Association of the facility. “We are humans too and have a family to run. We are risking our lives for humanity. Is it too much to ask for our due salaries,” Dr. Sardana asked. North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash had recently said the civic body was doing “everything possible to resolve the issue”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hindu-rao-doctors-go-on-strike-over-salary/article32798855.ece
08 October 2020||New Delhi,||In SC, Maharashtra says Palghar lynching pleas filed for ‘political capital’||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday said the petitions filed in the Supreme Court for a CBI probe into the lynching of two sadhus at Palghar was an attempt to derive “political capital” of the incident that happened during the pandemic lockdown. “All the action seems to have been taken by the State,” Justice Ashok Bhushan, heading a three-judge Bench, observed orally at the beginning of the hearing. Senior advocate R. Basant, for Maharashtra, affirmed that “all action has been taken”. He said the writ petitions filed under Article 32 of the Constitution should be wound up now. “Two crimes have been registered. One against the mob under murder and 126 persons have been charge-sheeted. The second one is against police officers who were at the scene. We think some of them ought to have acted better. They have been punished with compulsory retirement and/or other disciplinary actions... We don’t understand how Article 32 petitions are still pending... They are making political capital of these Article 32 petitions,” Mr. Basant submitted. The court gave the petitioners two weeks’ time to file their replies to the Maharashtra affidavit. Punished for negligence In an earlier hearing, the State informed the court that 18 police officers were punished for negligence and dereliction of duty for their inability to prevent the lynching. The police opposed the plea filed by the relatives of the priests to transfer the case to the CBI. A short affidavit filed by the police said a departmental enquiry prima facie found that they did not act in time to prevent the incident. The punishment of the 18 officers ranged from dismissal to reverting to minimal pay for a specific number of years and even compulsory retirement. An earlier affidavit by the government informed the court that a specialised unit of the State CID was probing the case since April 20 and two charge sheets against 126 accused had been filed. The court had ordered the State to place the charge sheets on record before it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/in-sc-maharashtra-says-palghar-lynching-pleas-filed-for-political-capital/article32798876.ece

08 October 2020||Washington,||‘America has become a dangerous place’||Standing in front of a field in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where a significant battle in the American Civil War was fought, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden spoke of a country divided and the need to come together. The former Vice President said America had become a “dangerous place” with something “darker” and more “dangerous” than just broken politics. “There’s no more fitting place than here today in Gettysburg, to talk about the cost of division. About how much it has cost America in the past, about how much it is costing us now, and about why I believe in this moment, we must come together as a nation,” he said in a speech of a little over 20 minutes. “There’s something bigger going on in this nation than just our broken politics. Something darker, something more dangerous... Too many Americans seek not to overcome our divisions, but to deepen them,” he said. Mr. Biden repeated a campaign theme: that while he is running as a “proud Democrat”, he would work for those who vote for him and those who do not. Mr. Biden, who first joined the U.S. Senate in 1973, has campaigned on his ability to work across aisle and committed to doing the same as President. Balancing act Mr. Biden has had to balance the expectations of his constituents on the left — such as progressives who did not see their candidate Bernie Sanders make it past the primaries — in addition to catering to his own moderate support base, while also appealing to Republicans disenchanted with the Trump administration. “I do not believe we have to choose between law and order, and racial justice in America. We can have both,” Mr. Biden said on Tuesday. The death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, at the hands of police officers sparked protests this summer that have spread across the country. While most of the protests have been peaceful, some have turned violent. Mr. Trump and Republicans have accused Mr. Biden of being soft on law and order — using violence against law enforcement officials to bolster their case. Talking about white supremacists, Mr. Biden said that in a Biden administration, hate would be given “no license” and “no oxygen”. “I think about what it takes for a black person to love America. That is a deep love for this country. That has for far too long, never been recognized,” Mr. Biden said. Scepticism for masks Mr. Biden said wearing a mask and social distancing were not political statements but scientific recommendations. His opponent Mr. Trump’s scepticism for masks and social distancing have been widely criticised. Mr. Trump and many of those who recently attended non-socially distant gatherings at the White House had tested positive for the coronavirus. Later on Tuesday, after Mr. Trump had tweeted that he was looking forward to the second debate with Mr. Biden scheduled for Octoebr 15, Mr. Biden said the debate should not go ahead if the President is still infected. “I think if he still has COVID, we shouldn’t have a debate,” he said, adding that his decision would be guided by medical advise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/america-has-become-a-dangerous-place/article32798533.ece
08 October 2020||Washington,||‘Pandemic could push 150 mn into extreme poverty’||Global extreme poverty is expected to rise for the first time in 20 years because of the disruption caused by COVID-19, exacerbating the impact of conflict and climate change, which were already slowing down poverty reduction, the World Bank said on Tuesday. The pandemic may push another 88 million to 115 million into extreme poverty or having to live on less than $1.50 per day, resulting in a total of 150 million such individuals, the Bank said in its biennial Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report. Some 9.1% to 9.4% of the world will be affected by extreme poverty in 2020, the Bank said, compared to 7.9% in the counterfactual scenario where the pandemic had not raged across the world. Many of the newly poor individuals will be from countries that already have high poverty rates while many in middle income countries (MICs) will slip below the poverty line, as per the report. Some 82% of the total will be in MICs. Sub-Saharan Africa, with 27-40 million new poor, and South Asia, with 49-57 million new poor, will be badly hit as per the Bank’s projections. “The pandemic and global recession may cause over 1.4% of the world’s population to fall into extreme poverty,” World Bank Group President David Malpass said via a press statement. “In order to reverse this serious setback to development progress and poverty reduction, countries will need to prepare for a different economy post-COVID, by allowing capital, labour, skills, and innovation to move into new businesses and sectors. World Bank Group support... will help developing countries resume growth and respond to the health, social, and economic impacts of COVID-19...,” he said. Lack of data in India As the government decided not to release the 2017-18 All India Household Consumer Expenditure Survey data from the 75th Round, there is an “important gap in understanding poverty in South Asia”, the report said. Consequently, the Bank has estimated India’s poverty numbers for 2017 based on “strong assumptions”, resulting in “considerable uncertainties”. In fact, a number of results in the report are incomplete, or uncertain because of the lack of data from India which, as per the report, accounted for 139 million of the 689 million people living in poverty in 2017,||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pandemic-could-push-150-mn-into-extreme-poverty/article32798531.ece
08 October 2020||COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka unveils operation to identify source of virus cluster||Days after Sri Lanka identified a new COVID-19 cluster, public health authorities, with the Army assisting them, are frantically tracing the source of the recent infections. “We have an elaborate operation in place to find out the source of infection,” chief epidemiologist Dr. Sudath Samaraweera told The Hindu on Wednesday, even as the government widened the curfew to include districts around Colombo. Sri Lanka had returned to near-normal life in the last couple of months after authorities effectively contained the spread of the virus. But authorities have had to step up targeted testing again, after a woman employed in a garment factory in Minuwangoda, about 40 km north of Colombo, tested positive this weekend. By Wednesday, the cluster rose to 1,022 persons, all employed in the factory. Subsequently the Ministry of Health banned public gatherings until further notice. ‘No India link, fake claim’ Meanwhile an Opposition legislator told Parliament on Wednesday about “some Indians” reportedly visiting the garment factory, located near the Bandaranaike International Airport, suggesting that was the source of the infections. However, Army Commander Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva, who heads the National Operation Centre for Prevention of COVID-19 Outbreak, denied the claim. Investigations revealed that there was no evidence of Indians having visited the facility and the claims were “false”, he told media persons. Brandix, the company whose garment factory witnessed the recent outbreak, too said in a statement that: “We can confirm that no parties from India or any other country have had access to the facility during this period.” Sri Lanka has so far reported 4,442 cases, 3,274 recoveries and 13 deaths.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-unveils-operation-to-identify-source-of-virus-cluster/article32798528.ece
08 October 2020||Islamabad,||Pakistan to keep top suspect in Daniel Pearl murder in jail||A British-born Pakistani man who has been on death row over the 2002 killing of American journalist Daniel Pearl will remain in jail for another three months despite his acquittal by a lower court earlier this year, according to a government order on Wednesday. The development was announced by prosecutors during a brief hearing of the high-profile case at Pakistan’s Supreme Court, which was to decide whether the key suspect in Pearl’s slaying, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, should stay in jail following his acquittal. More time sought The court convened on an appeal by Pearl’s family, seeking to keep Sheikh on death row over the beheading of the South Asia bureau chief of the Wall Street Journal . According to Faisal Siddiqi, the lawyer representing Pearl’s family, government prosecutor Fiaz Shah told the judges he needed more time for paperwork in connection with the case. The judges then adjourned the hearing till October 21. Mr. Siddiqi, who had expected the court to rule against Sheikh’s acquittal on Wednesday, said he still hopes such a decision would come before the expiration of the suspect’s new, 90-day detention. Sheikh’s defence lawyer, Mahmood Shaikh, told he had expected his client to walk free on Wednesday. “My client cannot he kept in jail for an indefinite period,” Mr. Shaikh said.  The government has opposed Sheikh’s release, despite his acquittal in April, saying it would endanger the public. Sheikh had been convicted of helping lure Pearl to a meeting in the southern Pakistani port city of Karachi, where he was kidnapped. Pearl had been investigating the link between Pakistani militants and Richard C. Reid, dubbed the “Shoe Bomber”, who attempted to blow up a flight from Paris to Miami with explosives hidden in his shoes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pakistan-to-keep-top-suspect-in-daniel-pearl-murder-in-jail/article32798530.ece

The judgment in an Athens court came as police and anti-fascist demonstrators clashed outside the courthouse, on the sidelines of a large protest of some 15,000 people. After a trial lasting over five years, presiding judge Maria Lepenioti said Golden Dawn founder and leader Nikos Michaloliakos and other senior members were guilty of running a criminal organisation. The prosecutions were sparked by the late-night murder of 34-year-old anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas in September 2013. He was chased down by a mob of Golden Dawn members and stabbed to death in front of a cafe in the western Athens suburb of Keratsini. “Democracy won today,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/athens-oct-7-2020-afp/article32798526.ece

08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||The identity game in Bihar politics||Amid receding floodwaters and a raging pandemic, Bihar is going to polls in the coming weeks — the first Indian State to do so since the COVID-19 outbreak started this year. Routine election activities like canvassing and rallies are getting complicated, with the Election Commission issuing strict but confusing guidelines that remain vastly overlooked across the length and breadth of the State. However, after our single round of fieldwork in the State, it can be said that the political situation in Bihar is less confusing after all, as there seems to be a pattern to the electoral preferences of voters. Old formula Our field study across seven sub-regions of the State revealed that the Janata Dal (United) (JD-U)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) had an upper hand. The NDA this time has gone back to its formula of ‘BJP plus JD(U)’ that won two successive Assembly elections, before both the parties parted ways in 2013, only to come together again in 2017. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) of former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has also rejoined the NDA. The NDA’s principal opponent, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led Mahagathbandhan, or the ‘Grand Alliance’, comprises the Congress and three Left parties — the CPI, the CPI(M) and the CPI(ML). Based on field insights, it could be inferred that the Nitish Kumar-led NDA seems likely to emerge victorious once again, while theMahagathbandhanmay find it difficult to strike a chord beyond their core base of Muslims and Yadavs despite having the opportunity to cash in on prevailing social, epidemic, economic and flood-related crises. The principal reason for this is the complex socio-political fabric of Bihar. While the State BJP has predominantly been a ‘Baniya’ party, an upper caste comprising less than 1/5th of Bihar’s population, the RJD has commanded the support of a majority of Yadavs and Muslims, who form around 1/3rd of the State’s population. With both these parties and their mass-bases locked in an unequal contest, the key to power lies with the remaining sections — the non-Yadav OBCs (other backward classes) like Kurmis and Koeris, the EBCs (extremely backward classes) like Nishads, Nai-Kahars and Mandals, and the Mahadalits like Paswans, Musahars and Chamars. Barring the Paswans, who have mostly remained committed to Ram Vilas Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), the remaining social sections have stood firmly by Mr. Kumar, thus explaining his indispensability in Bihar’s politics. This time too, little seems to have changed. Despite the fact that the sheen of Mr. Kumar’s image as the ‘Vikas Purush’ (development man) has petered out, the EBCs, the non-Yadav OBCs and Mahadalit voters we interacted with across the State unequivocally expressed that they will continue supporting him as ‘there is no better alternative’. Most of them accepted that they voted for the JD(U)-RJD-led Mahagathbandhan in 2015 and the NDA in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, showing the ‘transferability’ of Mr. Kumar’s diverse social base. It is this transferability that could change the fortunes of parties like the BJP or the RJD, which continue to remain locked in the plateaus of their respective social bases. Though it may seem counter-intuitive, the only other political force that commands a relatively diverse support base in Bihar are the Left parties. However, their influence is limited to small pockets, not covering more than 50 seats in total. Because of the history of land struggles and militant agitations, the Left in Bihar developed a social base among the Mahadalits, the EBC-OBCs, Muslims, and even the poor from upper castes. This explains RJD’s new-found love for the Left. Contrary to the prevailing argument that the deepening of identity politics has led to fragmentation of social bases of mainstream parties and the emergence of various caste leaders who could sway their support base, Bihar presents a different case. The new entrants, especially the Nishad-based Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) of Mukesh Sahani, the Kushwaha-based Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP) of Upendra Kushwaha, and the Mahadalit-based HAM, have failed to make their mark. Even then, Mr. Kumar was more than willing to bring Mr. Manjhi back into the party fold, while Mr. Kushwaha and Mr. Sahani were shunned. What explains this differential treatment? Symbolic vs. real appeal The answer lies in the directionality of alliances chosen by the new caste leaders. The ground reality is that the people of a caste have a pre-existing political inclination wherein they want a symbolic leader to accentuate their importance. As long as the leader pitches for more power in the same direction as desired by the community, she or he is celebrated. However, any move in the opposite direction is shunned, as it is considered a threat to the core social base. Hence, attempts by Upendra Kushwaha to break the old Kurmi-Kushwaha core, part of Mr. Kumar’s base, led to Mr. Kushwaha’s isolation by community members. Similarly, Mr. Sahani, despite being praised, has been rejected in the past by community voters for siding with the RJD. In our field-study, Nishads in Darbhanga (Bahadurpur), Samastipur (Morwa), Madhubani (Harlakhi), Begusarai (Bachhwara) declared Mr. Kumar as their leader, while stating that though Mr. Sahani did good, he should have stayed with Mr. Kumar. So, while a ‘pressure group’ model, as long as it increases the community’s bargaining power, is good, an attack on traditional support that could jeopardise patronage and benefits is bad. Hence, breaking from a pre-existing strong anchor may not be feasible. Meanwhile, there seems to be a discernible change in the attitude of Muslim voters. While a majority of them remain with the RJD, the appeal of Mr. Kumar has disappeared profoundly post the unrest following the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Interestingly, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader, Asaduddin Owaisi, has emerged as a force with strong electoral viability in the Muslim-dominated Seemanchal region. During the 2015 election, we had found significant Muslim anger towards Mr. Owaisi for being a vote-spoiler by dividing the community’s vote, which meant an advantage for the BJP. However, post the Centre’s CAA move, Mr. Owaisi seems to be an absolute gainer and Mr. Kumar the loser of the minority community’s votes in Bihar. In conclusion, armed with a wide social base of upper castes, the non-Yadav OBCs and a majority of Dalits, the NDA seems to have a decisive edge over the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan, which is struggling to find an appeal beyond its core support base of Muslims and Yadavs. Rajan Pandey teaches political science at Royal Global University, Guwahati.

08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||Using facts to hide underlying truths||The Hathras atrocity is weighing on the national conscience, or whatever is left of it. People have witnessed not just the most brutal face of social oppression, but a cynical and brazen use of the state machinery to support the oppressors. The inhuman assault of the teenage Dalit girl — I shall call her Bharati — that eventually killed her was followed by a hesitation in filing the first information report, the callous and deferred medical examination, the neglect of the dying declaration, and, most alarmingly, the haste in burning the body by the police without appropriate rites or the presence of family members. This wilful destruction of evidence was followed by political tyranny: family members were virtually put under house arrest, the entire village was barricaded by massive police force, Opposition leaders and mediapersons who tried to reach the victim’s family were stopped and roughed up — an appalling instance of dictatorial behaviour that made a mockery of our constitutional democracy. Shaping the discourse I shall not, however, focus on any of these, attending instead to the slippery speech-acts of spokespersons of the ruling party as they tried to shape the discourse around the horrific incident. Using false arguments to deceive the listener is a common form of sophistry. But what was heard here was the use of true statements to hide other more urgent and relevant truths. This is no ordinary fake news or misinformation but the clever use of seemingly appropriate words and phrases with the clear intention of deceiving the populace. Few better instances are available of how facts and truth are used to generate a false discourse. I illustrate my point with three examples. Take first the issue of mis-description. I heard it being said on a television channel that ‘I was pained at the death of the young woman’. On the face of it, it sounds sensitive and apt; it is true after all that Bharati died. And expression of pain at the loss of life seems fitting. But is it? Since it is incontrovertibly true that she was mercilessly pulverised and eventually killed, the term ‘died’ is entirely inappropriate. ‘Death’ fails to distinguish the demise of a person by natural causes, accident, suicide or murder. To speak of the death of a person when she was murdered is grossly misleading. If used persistently and deliberately it is nothing but unforgivable sophistry. It obfuscates truth. Likewise, pain alone is not an appropriate emotion in the face of a brutal murder. To not have feelings of anger, horror, or outrage indicates an emotional and moral disability. Overall then, expressing pain at Bharati’s ghastly murder is an inadequate emotion accompanying a gross mis-description. Together, they hide the truth of the gruesome incident. In human situations, finding just the right, the most appropriate description of what has occurred is often the difference between Truth and Falsehood. Irrelevant explanations Such mis-descriptions are not the only way in which powerful wrongdoers distort public discourse and evade responsibility. Very often, explanations that are otherwise factually correct or true are equally damaging. So, what is to be made of explanations of the chilling assault on Bharati by reference to the male propensity for aggression, violence and control? Consider the following example. An investigating police officer enters a charred house, and finds a can of kerosene and a used matchstick. As he exits, a reporter asks how the house caught fire. The officer answers “because of the presence of oxygen at the location”. Now, this account is not untrue, for nothing catches fire without the presence of oxygen. However, the response is entirely irrelevant and would send the news reporter into a tizzy. The answer is wrong because a good explanation needs to be not merely factually correct but relevant to the question at hand. Surely, at the back of the reporter’s mind is whether the house was burnt accidentally or intentionally and if the latter, precisely who caused it and why. Finding the motive and attributing responsibility for the criminal act is vital. Likewise, it is probably true that males are prone to aggression. Yet, like oxygen, this is part of the standing conditions of specific acts of rape and murder. It is not explanatorily relevant in most cases of actual violence such as in Hathras. If our interest is in finding precipitating causes for why Bharati was assaulted, we need to identify local social, economic, cultural, perhaps political factors. To provide irrelevant and general statements instead is a straightforward ploy to hide the truth, to cover up a possible crime. Likewise, broadening the discussion in the immediate aftermath of the atrocity by speaking generally about rapes all over the country deflects from the specific atrocity in Hathras and lets its perpetrators get off the hook. Identity of the victim This brings me to the third point which is so obvious that I am surprised that I need to make it at all. To say that Bharati was assaulted and murdered and stop there is being both economical with the truth and morally callous. The omission of a detail withholds the most crucial feature of the story, one without which what happened cannot be understood and explained. Horrendous as all rapes are, it was not just any woman who was brutalised by some men, but a Dalit who was sexually assaulted and killed by ‘upper caste’ men. This crime would likely not have occurred if it was not for Bharati’s Dalit identity. Indeed, she was reportedly gang raped and murderously beaten not only because she was a Dalit but precisely because in the past, her family had resisted ‘upper caste’ domination. Even Bharati did not remain mute as she lay battered, but named her perpetrators in her dying declaration. So, it is not false to say that a young woman was assaulted and murdered by brutal men, but to ignore Bharati’s Dalit-ness and hide the caste-related nature of the crime is to fail to explain what happened, provide a false account. For it is the criss-crossing co-presence of caste and gender that truly explains what happened to Bharati in Hathras. Ignoring or concealing this falsifies the account, even when no factually incorrect general statement, no outright lie is offered. We cannot paper over the difference between the horrendous act of killing a woman out of personal hatred for what she did, killing her to assert brute male power and murdering her only because of her Dalit identity. In a caste-ridden society, some groups are imprisoned in their castes, facing horrendous consequences simply on account of the family into which they are born, and because of where precisely their family happens to be located in caste hierarchy. The inadequacies of homilies Usually the same is true of our religious identity. This is why the targeting of Dalits or Muslims all over India or of Kashmiri Pandits only because of who they are brings in a dimension of violence that cannot be condemned by general homilies such as ‘all killing is horrible’ or that ‘all rapes are terrible’. These true, generalised statements tend then to obliterate the very reason for which some people are killed. To mistreat, discriminate and target individuals because of their colour, gender, religion or nationality is to commit a crime qualitatively different from other horrific acts. For it attacks and terrorises not just one person but her entire community. To omit any mention of these specific group identities where relevant is then to entirely mis-describe the crime and obscure its real cause. In short, in cases such as the Hathras atrocity where caste and gender oppression are deeply intertwined, one cannot foreground gender in a way that prevents people from seeing the causal role of caste in the violent act. To de-emphasise this point is to falsify the narrative. To place emphasis on just one and not on the other is also to distort the account. This politically motivated sophistry is dangerous. By legitimising the crime, it helps perpetuate it.

08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||Playing catch up in flood forecasting technology||Have you ever wondered how a local agency makes a decision if a flood forecast merely uses the words “Rising” or “Falling” above a water level at a river point? Especially when the time available to act is just 24 hours, there is no idea of the area of inundation, its depth, and when the accuracy of the forecast decreases at 24 hours and beyond? There are many times this happens in India during flood events, when the end users (district administration, municipalities and disaster management authorities) receive such forecasts and have to act quickly. These compelling scenarios are often experienced across most flood forecast river points, examples readers will be familiar with — in Assam, Bihar, Karnataka, Kerala or Tamil Nadu. Compare this with another form of flood forecast (known as the “Ensemble forecast”) that provides a lead time of 7-10 days ahead, with probabilities assigned to different scenarios of water levels and regions of inundation. An example of the probabilities ahead could be something like this: chances of the water level exceeding the danger level is 80%, with likely inundation of a village nearby at 20%. The “Ensemble flood forecast” certainly helps local administrations with better decision-making and in being better prepared than in a deterministic flood forecast. The United States, the European Union and Japan have already shifted towards “Ensemble flood forecasting” alongwith “Inundation modelling”. India has only recently shifted towards “Deterministic forecast” (i.e. “Rising” or “Falling” type forecast per model run). The shortcomings with Indian flood forecasting are glaring. A case of multiple agencies The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issues meteorological or weather forecasts while the Central Water Commission (CWC) issues flood forecasts at various river points. The end-user agencies are disaster management authorities and local administrations. Therefore, the advancement of flood forecasting depends on how quickly rainfall is estimated and forecast by the IMD and how quickly the CWC integrates the rainfall forecast (also known as Quantitative Precipitation Forecast or QPF) with flood forecast. It also is linked to how fast the CWC disseminates this data to end user agencies. Thus, the length of time from issuance of the forecast and occurrence of a flood event termed as “lead time” is the most crucial aspect of any flood forecast to enable risk-based decision-making and undertake cost-effective rescue missions by end user agencies. Technology plays a part in increasing lead time. Reports suggest that the IMD has about 35 advanced Doppler weather radars to help it with weather forecasting. Compared to point scale rainfall data from rain gauges, Doppler weather radars can measure the likely rainfall directly (known as Quantitative Precipitation Estimation or QPE) from the cloud reflectivity over a large area; thus the lead time can be extended by up to three days. But the advantage of advanced technology becomes infructuous because most flood forecasts at several river points across India are based on outdated statistical methods (of the type gauge-to-gauge correlation and multiple coaxial correlations) that enable a lead time of less than 24 hours. This is contrary to the perception that India’s flood forecast is driven by Google’s most advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques! These statistical methods fail to capture the hydrological response of river basins between a base station and a forecast station. They cannot be coupled with QPF too. Google AI has adopted the hydrological data and forecast models derived for diverse river basins across the world for training AI to issue flood alerts in India. This bypasses the data deficiencies and shortcomings of forecasts based on statistical methods. Not uniform across India A study by the National Institute of Technology, Warangal, Telangana shows that it is only recently that India has moved to using hydrological (or simply rainfall-runoff models) capable of being coupled with QPF. So, a lead time of three days is sporadic in India, and at select river points. Just as the CWC’s technological gap limits the IMD’s technological advancement, the technological limitations of the IMD can also render any advanced infrastructure deployed by CWC infructuous. Here is another example. The United States which is estimated to have a land area thrice that of India, has about 160 next generation S-band Doppler weather radars (NEXRAD) with a range of 250-300 km. India will need at least an 80-100 S-band dense radar network to cover its entire territory for accurate QPF. Else, the limitations of altitude, range, band, density of radars and its extensive maintenance enlarge the forecast error in QPF which would ultimately reflect in the CWC’s flood forecast. Conspicuously, the error margin is always away from the public gaze. Therefore, outdated technologies and a lack of technological parity between multiple agencies and their poor water governance decrease crucial lead time. Forecasting errors increase and the burden of interpretation shifts to hapless end user agencies. The outcome is an increase in flood risk and disaster. Ensemble technology Global weather phenomenon is chaotic. For instance theoretically, “the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Chennai can create a Tornado in Tokyo” according to MIT’s Edward Lorenz. In simple terms and scientifically, any small change in the initial conditions of a weather model results in an output that is completely unexpected. Therefore, beyond a lead time of three days, a deterministic forecast becomes less accurate. The developed world has shifted from deterministic forecasting towards ensemble weather models that measure uncertainty by causing perturbations in initial conditions, reflecting the different states of the chaotic atmosphere. Probabilities are then computed for different flood events, with a lead time beyond 10 days. India has a long way to go before mastering ensemble model-based flood forecasting. Although, the IMD has begun testing and using ensemble models for weather forecast through its 6.8 peta flops supercomputers (“Pratyush” and “Mihir”), the forecasting agency has still to catch up with advanced technology and achieve technological parity with the IMD in order to couple ensemble forecasts to its hydrological models. It has to modernise not only the telemetry infrastructure but also raise technological compatibility with river basin-specific hydrological, hydrodynamic and inundation modelling. To meet that objective, it needs a technically capable workforce that is well versed with ensemble models and capable of coupling the same with flood forecast models. It is only then that India can look forward to probabilistic-based flood forecasts with a lead time of more than seven to 10 days and which will place it on par with the developed world. With integration between multiple flood forecasting agencies, end user agencies can receive probabilistic forecasts that will give them ample time to decide, react, prepare and undertake risk-based analysis and cost-effective rescue missions, reducing flood hazard across the length and breadth of India.

08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||Gig work and its skewed terms||The new Code on Social Security allows a platform worker to be defined by their vulnerability — not their labour, nor the vulnerabilities of platform work. Swiggy workers have been essential during the pandemic. Even so, they have faced a continuous dip in pay and no rewards for being essential workers. During the last six months, many platform workers have unionised under the All India Gig Workers Union and have protested day in and day out, deploring Swiggy for reducing their base pay from Rs. 35 to Rs. 10 per delivery order. It has been truly remarkable to see the ‘food delivery’ identity being developed through collective action, just as that of Uber and Ola taxi drivers has been taking shape for a few years now. Stable terms of earning have been a key demand of delivery-persons and drivers through years of protests. The three new labour codes passed by Parliament recently acknowledge platform and gig workers as new occupational categories in the making, in a bid to keep India’s young workforce secure as it embraces ‘new kinds of work’, like delivery, in the digital economy. But do the codes let Swiggy workers ask for the pay that they were promised? No. What a platform worker is allowed to claim as rights, responsibilities and working conditions that can be legally upheld is the key question in these codes, such as for factory workers, who have been an important industrial element in India and around the world. The specific issues of working in factories, the duration of time needed on a factory floor, and associated issues are recognised as the parameters for defining an ideal worker under most labour laws, and this has not shifted much. Defining an ‘employee’ The Code on Wages, 2019, tries to expand this idea by using ‘wages’ as the primary definition of who an ‘employee’ is. The wage relationship is an important relationship in the world of work, especially in the context of a large informal economy. Even so, the terms ‘gig worker’, ‘platform worker’ and ‘gig economy’ appear elsewhere in the Code on Social Security. Since the laws are prescriptive, what is written within them creates the limits to what rights can be demanded, and how these rights can be demanded. Hence, the categories and where they appear become key signs for understanding what kind of identity different workers can have under these new laws. Platform delivery people can claim benefits, but not labour rights. This distinction makes them beneficiaries of State programmes. This does not allow them to go to court to demand better and stable pay, or regulate the algorithms that assign the tasks. This also means that the government or courts cannot pull up platform companies for their choice of pay, or how long they ask people to work. The main role of the laws for a ‘platform worker’ is to make available benefits and safety nets from the government or platform companies. Even though platforms are part of the idea of how work will evolve in the future, the current laws do not see them as future industrial workers. No guarantees In the Code on Social Security, 2020, platform workers are now eligible for benefits like maternity benefits, life and disability cover, old age protection, provident fund, employment injury benefits, and so on. However, eligibility does not mean that the benefits are guaranteed. None of these are secure benefits, which means that from time to time, the Central government can formulate welfare schemes that cover these aspects of personal and work security, but they are not guaranteed. Actualising these benefits will depend on the political will at the Central and State government-levels and how unions elicit political support. For some states like Karnataka, where a platform-focused social security scheme was in the making last year, this will possibly offer some financial assistance by the Centre. However, that is not assured. The language in the Code is open enough to imply that platform companies can be called upon to contribute either solely or with the government to some of these schemes. But it does not force the companies to contribute towards benefits or be responsible for workplace issues. The ‘platform worker’ identity has the potential to grow in power and scope, but it will be mediated by politicians, election years, rates of under-employment, and large, investment- heavy technology companies that are notorious for not complying with local laws. But there are no guarantees for better and more stable days for platform workers, even though they are meant to be ‘the future of work’.

08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||The cost of political posturing||U.S. President Donald Trump has done it again, and this time only a few weeks before a Presidential election — the 45th Commander-in-Chief has put another turn in the screws of his country’s immigration system by announcing a hike in the salaries for those arriving in the U.S. on H-1B or skilled-worker visas. This is expected to cut visa applications by around 33%, according to experts, and it comes as only the latest White House rule following executive actions that earlier banned the issuance of new skilled worker visas and new green cards. The question that these policy changes beg is, how much of the motivation for them is pure economic rationale versus political value for the incumbent’s final stages of election campaigning? It would not be unreasonable to expect that the visa issuance ban, combined with the mandatory salary floor soon to be instituted, will seriously hit U.S. imports of services from India, estimated to be at $29.6 billion in 2018, 4.9% more than in 2017, and 134% more than 2008 levels. The skilled visa issuance picture has been a positive one to date: the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has been issuing 85,000 H-1B visas annually, of which 20,000 are given to graduate students and 65,000 to private sector applicants, approximately 70% of which are granted to Indian nationals. The Migration Policy Institute has predicted that Mr. Trump’s June 22, 2020 ban on new H-1B visa issuance could impact up to 219,000 workers, who would effectively be blocked from taking up any potential jobs on offer in the U.S. going forward. But how likely are firms, including the Silicon Valley tech giants, to embark on recruitment drives at this economically depressed time in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic? Although unemployment in the U.S. peaked in the summer and has fallen for the fifth consecutive month since then, the latest figures suggest that both the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed people remain substantially higher than the pre-pandemic values in February 2020. Even so, it is important to distinguish between the ban on new visa issuance and the Labour Department rule that would insist on higher salaries being paid to all H-1B visa workers in the U.S. Under the latter rule, assuming it stands the test of time and inevitable litigation, companies would be required to pay entry-level staff in the 45th percentile of their industry’s salary instead of the 17th percentile; for high-skilled workers, the rise would be from the 67th to the 95th percentile. Staunch criticism Speaking of litigation, it is telling that days before the Trump administration’s announcement of the proposed salary hike that makes H-1B hiring significantly more expensive to potential employers, a federal judge in the Northern District of California blocked the enforcement of the new visa ban, ruling that the President “exceeded his authority” under the U.S. Constitution. Driving that legal challenge to the White House proclamation was a swathe of U.S. manufacturing and industry associations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Retail Federation, TechNet, a technology industry group, and Intrax Inc., which sponsors cultural exchanges. In a similar vein, Google CEO Sundar Pichai hit out at the ban, saying, “Immigration has contributed immensely to America’s economic success, making it a global leader in tech, and also Google the company it is today. Disappointed by today’s proclamation — we’ll continue to stand with immigrants and work to expand opportunity for all.” Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple CEO Tim Cook echoed similar sentiments. This goes to the heart of the issue, the question of why Mr. Trump is willing to risk damage to corporate America’s bottom lines, all to garner some campaign ammunition for his familiar plank of nativist populism. The answer is a simple one: people vote, while companies do not. What might happen after the election is an entirely different story. narayan@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-cost-of-political-posturing/article32798519.ece
08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||Four for one||With the second meeting of the Australia-India-Japan-United States Quadrilateral Strategic Dialogue of Foreign Ministers in Tokyo on Tuesday, the Quad has entered a decisive phase. The Ministers, who had last met at the UN General Assembly, made a considered push to hold the meeting, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. In a departure from the earlier secrecy, they made public a large part of their deliberations, including the decision to make the FM meeting an annual event, to cooperate on combating the pandemic, and on building infrastructure, connectivity and a supply chain initiative in the region. As the host, Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga dispelled any notion that he might not be as proactive as his predecessor, Shinzō Abe, who originally conceived the idea in 2007. Australia’s Foreign Minister Marise Payne attended despite the two-week quarantine that she faces on return, and India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar undertook the journey despite the government’s preoccupation with the LAC stand-off. But it is probably the U.S. that displayed the most eagerness to hold the meeting, just weeks before the Presidential election. Mr. Trump’s COVID-19 illness and sudden hospitalisation prompted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to cancel other scheduled stops, in South Korea and Mongolia. But in Tokyo, he made it clear that his mission was to direct the Quad towards building a coalition to counter Beijing’s aggression in the region, saying that their partnership was not “multilateralism for the sake of it”. He called on the entire Quad to “collaborate to protect” the region from what he called the “CCP’s exploitation, corruption, and coercion”, pointing to the LAC stand-off, as well as Chinese aggression in the South and East China Seas. What he seemed to propose was not just a coalition of democracies committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific, as the Quad’s informal charter has thus far stated. Instead, the U.S. seems keen on turning the Quadrilateral into a full-fledged military alliance of countries facing tensions with China. The government should not downplay the import of such openly stated intentions. While Japan and Australia are bound by alliance treaties to the U.S., New Delhi has thus far charted its course on strategic autonomy. Mr. Pompeo’s words could well be bluster borne of politics ahead of the U.S. elections, but they point to an interest in bringing India into bilateral tensions in the Indo-Pacific, while inviting the Quad to take a role in India-China tensions as well. The Modi government has rebuffed such suggestions, and any shift would be unwise now. India has much to gain strategically and in terms of capacity building from the Quadrilateral dialogue, but little from the impression it is being led by Washington on an important initiative for the region in which India is an equal and important stake-holder.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/four-for-one/article32798507.ece
08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||The hole in the middle||This year’s Nobel prize in physics awards studies that established the existence of black holes. It celebrates theoretical work as much as it does dedicated observation. Andrea Ghez is only its fourth woman recipient. Roger Penrose, now at Oxford, who gets half the prize, ingeniously used mathematics in the 1960s to theorise under what conditions black holes must form. This was a time when the reality of black holes as a solution to Albert Einstein’s field equations of the General Theory of Relativity was not accepted by many prominent physicists. Within a couple of months after Einstein proposed his General Theory of Relativity in 1915, Karl Schwarzschild published a solution to the field equations that exhibited singularities, or points where physical quantities grew infinitely large or vanished. Today, this is understood as the event horizon — the point of no return beyond which even light cannot escape the black hole’s gravitational attraction. While more solutions were found to Einstein’s equations that suggested black holes, they all required special symmetries and their realisation under general astrophysical conditions was doubtful. Penrose, through the singularity theorems, identified the formation of trapped surfaces as the condition for the formation of black holes in a generic manner. In this climate came observational hints of supermassive black holes, through the discovery of what were initially called quasars that were supermassive and found at the centre of galaxies. The other half of the prize is jointly awarded to Reinhard Genzel, at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, Garching, Germany, and Prof. Ghez, of the UCLA, U.S., for showing that the dense region in the centre of our galaxy — the Milky Way — is indeed a black hole. Towards the end of the 1960s it was clear that the region named Sagittarius A* occupies the centre of the Milky Way, which is about 26,000 light years away. Around this, all stars in the galaxy orbit. In the 1990s, when telescopes and equipment were developed that could tackle this distance, Prof. Genzel and Prof. Ghez set up independent groups to explore this region. They built unique instruments and pursued research from Very Large Telescope, in Chile, and the Keck Observatory, Hawaii, respectively. For three decades, the groups tracked nearly 30 stars, in particular one named S-2 (or S-O2). This star’s orbit has been nearly completely tracked. These stars followed elliptical, Keplerian, orbits, which can only imply a central concentrated massive object — a supermassive black hole. Thus, the prize strings together theoretical research from the 1960s driven by conviction, and a three-decade long observational study that started in the 1990s. It reiterates that in the pursuit of truth, time is but a twinkle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-hole-in-the-middle/article32798508.ece
08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||Kerala and Assam find more jobs for their women||[Bombay, October 7] More than one in every ten persons employed in India’s organised sector is a woman. In agriculture and forestry sector, women employed have a much higher proportion of about four in ten. Since more women find employment in plantations than in any other sector, Kerala and Assam, though industrially backward, provide more jobs for their women folk than other States. In Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, the educated eve seems to be chasing more jobs in the services. In June 1969, they accounted for 13.1 per cent of the jobs in services (largely in education and health services). In mining and quarrying, women accounted for 9.1 per cent and in manufacturing industries 8.5 per cent. This picture of women’s employment in the organised sector is presented in an article prepared in the Division of Planning and Special Studies of the Reserve Bank and published in the latest bulletin. The data exclude employment in agriculture, self-employed, household establishments, those in the private sector employing less than ten workers and defence forces. Of the total number of 16.5 million persons employed as at the end of June 1969, women constituted 1.82 million or 11 per cent. The private sector employed more women than the public sector – 1.04 million against 0.78 million.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/kerala-and-assam-find-more-jobs-for-their-women/article32798516.ece
08 October 2020||MUMBAI,||TCS Q2 net dips 7% to Rs. 7,475 cr.||Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) on Wednesday reported second-quarter net profit declined 7% to Rs. 7,475 crore, from Rs. 8,042 crore in the year-earlier period. Net income after excluding a provision of Rs. 1,218 crore towards a legal claim, however, was 4.9% higher at Rs. 8,433 crore, TCS said. Consolidated revenue grew 3% to Rs. 40, 135 crore. Revenue in constant currency terms, however, declined 3.2% on a year-on-year basis, TCS said in a regulatory filing. The software services provider’s board approved a share buy-back of Rs. 16,000 crore at Rs. 3,000 per share — representing a 9.6% premium over Wednesday’s closing price on the BSE of Rs. 2,737.40. The buy-back amounts to 1.42% of the total paid up share capital. As on September 30, TCS had Rs. 58,500 crore cash in hand. The company also announced an interim dividend of Rs. 12 per equity share. “Driving accelerated business value realisation of our customers’ digital investments has resulted in broad-based revenue growth,” CEO and MD Rajesh Gopinathan said. “The strong order book, a very robust deal pipeline, and continued market share gains give us confidence for the future,” he added. “What we are witnessing right now is the start of the first phase of a multi-year technology transformation cycle.

08 October 2020||Bengaluru,||‘Check facial recognition misuse’||Countries around the globe, including India, should have proper regulations to ensure governments do not use facial recognition or any other facet of artificial intelligence (AI), in a way that would impinge on peoples’ most-cherished democratic freedoms, urged Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer, Microsoft. “What does facial recognition mean in a country, say in India, or a world where we value freedom of expression, where we want people to have the freedom to assemble,” asked Mr. Smith. “Should we be comfortable with the prospect that people can be surveilled if they are peacefully protesting?” he queried while speaking at RAISE 2020, a virtual global AI summit. Mr. Smith saw work on AI being done in India to be very important. “One of the reasons I think the work in India is of such fundamental importance globally is that I think these issues around facial recognition, for example, go to the heart of democratic freedoms, and it will be the world’s great democracies that need to lead the way,” he said. While AI can revolutionise virtually every part of the economy, Mr. Smith said countries that move the fastest while deploying AI will find they will be accelerating economic growth faster.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/check-facial-recognition-misuse/article32798486.ece
08 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Need short-term relief to retain long-term growth hopes’||Emerging markets must take urgent relief measures to address distress among households and small firms due to the pandemic and lockdowns, instead of holding off for a stimulus package after the virus is reined in, former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan said on Tuesday. Speaking at ICRIER’s annual G20 conference, Dr. Rajan said countries such as Mexico, Peru and India have been very badly affected by the pandemic, both in terms of infection rates and the adverse effects on households and firms. “Many governments have been cautious, and some would argue overly cautious, because they have lower resources for relief, and they fear rating downgrades. For a number of countries, the right thing to do, which is perhaps what the IMF is now saying, is to spend to diminish the damage than to wait to spend hoping that it will increase demand,” Dr. Rajan said, stressing that relief was distinct from stimulus measures that only aim to increase demand. “If you don’t provide relief, your small and medium firms and households are much less able to produce or spend when the recovery happens, and the economy’s potential growth is reduced largely from the supply side. Some countries are saying let’s wait till we control the pandemic because then we can boost demand by a whole bunch of stimulus spending,” Dr. Rajan said, underlining that such a stimulus would be extremely inflationary smaller firms have gone out of business. India can expand its fiscal space for spending more on relief measures if it can build institutions to convince markets that it will be fiscally responsible over the medium term. “Adopt a debt target with legislation, appoint that independent fiscal commission which will look at Budgets and talk about where there is lack of transparency, hiding the true fiscal position,” he said, adding this required significant reform actions in the short term but which could trigger a virtuous cycle. “The alternative is a vicious cycle, if the government is frozen and does nothing, saying I won’t spend because I don’t have the money, rating agency will downgrade me… so we will pick up the pieces when we find them. (Then) private sector deteriorates, growth potential falls, and the rating agencies eventually decide you have huge debts, are not growing, so let me downgrade you anyway,” he said, adding that this holds true for many emerging markets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/need-short-term-relief-to-retain-long-term-growth-hopes/article32798498.ece

08 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Cabinet nod for reforms in natural gas marketing||The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday approved ‘natural gas marketing reforms’ with an aim to standardise the procedure to discover the price of gas sold in the market. “The policy has also permitted affiliate companies to participate in the bidding process in view of the open, transparent and electronic bidding,” an official statement said. “This will facilitate and promote more competition in marketing of gas.” It, however, added that rebidding would be needed in case only affiliates participated, and that there were no other bidders. The Centre said the policy would bring uniformity to the bidding process across various contractual regimes and policies to avoid ambiguity and contribute towards ease of doing business. “The policy will also grant marketing freedom to Field Development Plans of those Blocks in which Production Sharing Contracts already provide pricing freedom,” it added. The government expects the move to spur production of, infrastructure for and marketing of natural gas, while also creating jobs in gas-consuming sectors, including in MSMEs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/cabinet-nod-for-reforms-in-natural-gas-marketing/article32798492.ece

Addressing the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he said there was space on the monetary and fiscal side for a further stimulus. “We recognise there is a need for providing further stimulus to the economy at some point in time as may be appropriate.” He added unlike others that had opted for demand creation, India was focussed on creating safety nets for vulnerable sections and businesses, given fiscal constraints. “If we tried to re-inflate consumption demand in April, May, June it would have been... a waste of resources for..., we ourselves had locked down all avenues for spending.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/more-stimulus-at-the-right-time-says-sanyal/article32798503.ece

08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||Super Kings lose the plot, Knight Riders hold their nerve||Chennai Super Kings squandered a good start and stumbled in its chase, losing to Kolkata Knight Riders by 10 runs at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. Chasing 168 for victory, CSK was 90 for one at the end of 10 overs before KKR fought back strongly, led by Sunil Narine, to record its third win of the season. Good platform Shane Watson continued his good run from the previous match, scoring 50 (40b, 6x4, 1x6) as he set a good platform with Ambati Rayudu (30). But once the two were dismissed in quick succession, first Rayudu followed by Watson — leg-before to Narine — the game slipped away. Vital wickets The West Indian spinner was ably supported by Kamlesh Nagarkoti, C.V. Varun and Andre Russell, all of whom chipped in with crucial wickets. The CSK middle-order looked out of sorts, as M.S. Dhoni, Kedar Jadhav and Sam Curran struggled to get the remaining runs. It was a puzzling decision by the team management to send an out-of-form Jadhav (7 n.o., 12b, 1x4) ahead of powerful hitters such as Dwayne Bravo and Ravindra Jadeja. Boundaries dry up CSK could not strike any boundaries between the 11th and 15th overs, scoring only 20 runs. Earlier, Rahul Tripathi justified his promotion to the top of the order by smashing a 51-ball 81 (8x4, 3x6) and guiding KKR to a respectable score of 167. Led by leg-spinner Karn Sharma’s brilliant spell (4-0-25-2) in the middle overs, CSK came back strongly. Karn, who replaced Piyush Chawla, was playing his first match of the season. Tripathi, who shot into the limelight in the 2017 IPL as an opener for Rising Pune Supergiant, made full use of the opportunity to go after the bowling in the PowerPlay. After being hit for a six by Tripathi in his opening over, Karn made a grand comeback. He varied his length and pace cleverly and did not concede another boundary in his spell. Pulling things back Kolkata Knight Rider, at 93 for two after 10 overs, was well placed for a strong finish. But Super Kings medium-pacers Shardul Thakur (two for 28), Curran (two for 26) and Bravo (three for 37) ensured that KKR’s momentum was arrested. In the end, however, KKR had enough runs on the board to hand CSK its fourth defeat of the season.

08 October 2020||Abu Dhabi,||‘Bumrah was keen to take new ball’||Mumbai Indians bowling coach Shane Bond has revealed that star pacer Jasprit Bumrah took the new ball and backed his yorkers with renewed vigour against Rajasthan Royals as he was a bit disappointed with his IPL performances so far. Bumrah, who was having a rather ordinary tournament, was back to his destructive best, claiming a four-wicket haul as his side inflicted a 57-run defeat on Rajasthan on Tuesday. Prize scalp It was the first time the 26-year-old was handed the new ball in the tournament and Bumrah didn’t disappoint, returning the impressive figures of 4/20, including the prized scalp of Steve Smith. “Jasprit genuinely wanted to take the new ball so there was a discussion that went on one day before the game against Royals, we obviously have used him in a defensive manner at the back-end of the PowerPlay,” said Bond during the post-match press conference. “It was a fresh wicket and there was grass on it, he has the ability to nip the ball around, we knew Rajasthan’s key players were in the top-order so we wanted to give him an opportunity to get out there, take the new ball and take some wickets for us,” he added. Bond said the Indian pace spearhead was unhappy with his performances in the tournament and wanted to make the kind of impact that is expected from a bowler of his calibre. “Jasprit really wanted to back his yorkers against Royals, he wanted to go back to his strengths and use his bouncer as he normally does,” the New Zealander said. Better and better “That’s his strength, if he is not happy with his performances, he tends to bounce back to a new level. I know, traditionally through IPL, Bumrah tends to get better and better,” he added. The former fast bowler said the defending champions, who are currently perched on top of the points table, remain smoothly on course for the play offs. “We have started to really hit our straps. We are extremely confident that we will be competitive and if we keep playing as we are, I am sure we will be in the playoffs.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bumrah-was-keen-to-take-new-ball-bond/article32798644.ece
08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||Mumbai outclasses Rajasthan, goes to the top of the table||In addition to having a battery of reliable all-rounders, one of the features of Mumbai Indians’ consistent success in the Indian Premier League over the years has been its all-round performance on the field. This was on full display at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday, as a well-oiled MI machine reversed its adverse recent head-to-head record against Rajasthan Royals with a stylish 57-run win. Defending a total of 193, Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah — the Indian pace spearhead using the new ball for the first time this season — reduced Royals to 12 for three in the third over to take the fizz out of the chase. And just when Jos Buttler (70, 44b, 4x4, 5x6) started to cut loose, Kieron Pollard pulled off a stunner on the boundary line. Despite misjudging the ball for a split second, Pollard leapt high and caught the ball on the second attempt.  This effort was as spectacular as the Superman-like dive from substitute Anukul Roy — fielding in place of Suryakumar, who was hit on the helmet — to dismiss Mahipal Lomror. Bumrah then ran through the tail to end Royals’ innings for 136, handing MI a comprehensive win. Suryakumar Yadav’s personal best in the IPL (79 n.o., 47b, 11x4, 2x6) won him the Man-of-the-Match honours. It also helped the defending champion regain the top position, although it has played a match more than second-placed Delhi Capitals.  Royals 84 for four Royals were 84 for four in 12 overs with Buttler (59) and Tom Curran (6) at the crease. Jaiswal (0), Smith (6), Samson (0) and Lomror (11) were the batsmen out||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mumbai-outclasses-rajasthan-goes-to-the-top-of-the-table/article32798600.ece
08 October 2020||KOZHIKODE,||Tyagi is an exciting talent: Buttler||Jos Buttler finally was back amongst the runs on Tuesday. But his 44-ball 70 could only soften the blow a bit for Rajasthan Royals from Mumbai Indians at Abu Dhabi. Buttler, who was in cracking form for Royals in the last IPL, had failed to get going in the first three games. “I hadn’t been feeling my best in the middle,” the England wicketkeeper-batsman said. Finding his feet “I still feel like I am finding my form a bit. It was good for me to have spent some time in the middle. “Hopefully I can take some confidence from today and use that for the rest of the tournament.” He said Royals had to sort out the issues at the top of the order. “We haven’t managed to come off as a top-order in the last three games,” he said. “We lost three wickets in the PowerPlay... In T20 cricket, you never win too many games from that position.” One of the few positives for Royals against Mumbai was Kartik Tyagi, the 19-year-old seamer who made a promising debut. “He is really an exciting talent,” he said. “One thing the IPL always does is unearth fantastic young Indian players.” Praise for Suryakumar He was all praise for Suryakumar Yadav, whose unbeaten 79 (47b) laid the foundation for Mumbai’s victory. “He played a fantastic innings,” said Buttler. “We couldn’t quite tie him down. He used the angles and the crease very well.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tyagi-is-an-exciting-talent-buttler/article32798648.ece

Ashwin cited his close friendship with Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) opener Aaron Finch as a reason for not affecting the ‘Mankad’ dismissal in their IPL encounter on Monday. Like a derailed bogey Ashwin added that Capitals head coach Ricky Ponting wanted him to run Finch out. “Going into my jump, I saw a gold helmet (Finch) moving forward like a derailed bogey of a train. I stopped to think whether to run him out or not. Finch didn’t even return to the crease; he just stared at me. Finch and I played together at KXIP. Finch is a great guy; he is my friend. We spent a lot of time together during our KXIP days. I did the math in my head — it did not work out, so I gave him a final warning,” Ashwin said, on his Youtube channel. Finch’s offence was so blatant that even Ponting — reportedly not a fan of ‘Mankading’ — reversed his stand. “I met Ponting after the match. He said, ‘Finch ventured out so far out that I wanted to get up and tell you to run him out’. Ponting said that he is speaking to the ICC Committee, asking for a rule which imposes a penalty for batsmen who leave the crease early,” Ashwin said. Ashwin stated that imposing a 10-run penalty is the only way to stop batsmen from leaving the crease early.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ashwin-let-off-pal-finch/article32798646.ece

The tournament will be played in a round-robin format and the side topping the standings will move into the I-League proper, which will also be played in the different venues in city and its outskirts later this year. The tournament will also offer a test of the bio-bubble concept, which is about placing all the eligible players, support staff and officials in a bio-secure atmosphere till the end of the tournament, which is October 19. The first match — scheduled for 12.30 p.m. at the Kalyani Stadium — will feature two strong sides in Bhawanipur and Bengaluru United, who have built their sides with recruits from the I-League big names. “This tournament is a big effort at returning us all to our daily lives, which is playing football,” said Sankarlal Chakraborty, the former Mohun Bagan coach currently in charge of Bhawanipur. Under quarantine  Chakraborty will miss Liberian forward Ansumana Kromah, who has been quarantined after testing positive twice. Discussions justifiably hovered around the pandemic and its effect on football. “Most of the best practices that come with the COVID safety regulations are part of the new normal and have become second nature for our squad by now,” FC Bengaluru head coach Richard Hood said.

08 October 2020||Buenos Aires,||Messi-Barca soap opera takes a break||Superstar footballer Lionel Messi will take a break from his Barcelona soap opera as he bids to fire Argentina to the World Cup in Qatar and what will probably be his last chance to try to win the coveted trophy. The 33-year-old, a record six-time winner of the Ballon d’Or , has won everything in the club game with Barcelona several times over but his international trophy cabinet looks bare in comparison. “The only goal I have now is to win the World Cup with the national team,” he has said. Losing finalist The closest he has come so far was as losing finalist against Germany in 2014. Thursday’s clash with Ecuador gives him the chance to start building towards one last tilt at that goal. He will be 35 by the time the Qatar World Cup ends, and will turn 39 during the following global showpiece in North America. In the meantime, he has a pair of qualifiers — Argentina also travels to Bolivia next Tuesday — to distract him from his club travails. Messi tried to force his exit from the Catalan giants in the close season but Barca held firm and a €700 million release clause ensured he remained, albeit disgruntled. Potential difficulty Playing Ecuador in his homeland may provide a welcome respite but it is also fraught with potential difficulty. Four years ago at the start of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, Ecuador stunned Argentina 2-0 at River Plate’s iconic Monumental stadium in Buenos Aires. It took a hat-trick by an inspired Messi in Argentina’s final qualifier — away to Ecuador — to send the twice world champion to Russia. Thursday’s match will be in another iconic stadium: Boca Juniors’ Bombonera. But it will be a surreal experience in an empty ground that would normally be bouncing with stands packed full of some of the most fervent and passionate fans in the world.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/messi-barca-soap-opera-takes-a-break/article32798656.ece
08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||The right path||Uddhava seeks answers to many questions from Lord Krishna, and the Lord gives him crisp explanations, said P.T. Seshadri in a discourse. Uddhava wants to know the meaning of jugupsa, sukha, dukkha, pantha, dunmaarga, svargah, naraka and griha. The Lord says that to be afraid to do wrong is jugupsa. Not desiring anything is beauty. Sukha is to see good luck and misfortune alike. Dukha is the anticipation of carnal pleasures. To Uddhava’s question about pantha, the right path to take, the Lord says that trying to reach Him is the right path. Dunmaarga, the bad path, is enjoying only the pleasures of worldly life. Having sattva guna is svarga. If tamasic qualities dominate one’s mind, that is naraka. The Lord says that the bodies of human beings constitute His griha. Not only does Uddhava want many things to be defined by the Lord, he also wants to know who are the people who answer to various descriptions. He asks who are the people who can be called pandita, moorkha, aadhya, daridra, kripana, Iswara. The Lord replies that he who knows the difference between worldly attachments and moksha is a pandita. He who thinks the body and the atma are one and the same is a moorkha. Aadhya is one who is blessed with a wealth of good qualities. Daridra is a person who is discontented. Kripana is a petty man, who has no control over his senses. Iswara is the One who is beyond the three gunas. The Lord then tells Uddhava that the cause for a lot of sorrow in this world is money and the greed to get more and more money. The desire to amass wealth makes us miserable. It is the bent of mind we havethat urges us to go after riches. So, ultimately, it is the mind that is the culprit. If we keep the mind under control, then sorrow can be kept away.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-right-path/article32798595.ece

Rocket Man by Elton John — a friend of Jones — echoed through the 100,000-capacity arena as the hearse, followed by only 10 mourners due to anti-coronavirus rules, proceeded around the field on Saturday. Deeply moved “We have been deeply moved by the outpouring of love for Dean over the last week and can't thank everyone enough for their support and for sharing their memories with us,” Jones’ wife Jane said in a tribute statement. “We will forever miss Dean's energy, his zest for life, passion for cricket and his love for us as a family,” she added. Known as “Deano”, and an inspiration for his aggressive batting, Jones was remembered as a fierce competitor whose knockabout demeanour concealed a keen cricketing mind.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/poignant-farewell-for-dean-jones/article32798654.ece
08 October 2020||DUBAI,||A battle of power-hitters||With their respective bowling attacks struggling to find form, Kings XI Punjab and Sunrisers Hyderabad will look to their power-hitters to do the job when the two teams go head to head in the IPL here on Thursday. KXIP’s strength has been its formidable opening duo. Skipper K.L. Rahul has scored two fifties and a century, while Mayank Agarwal also has a half-century and a three-figure knock to his credit. But despite the solid batting performances, KXIP has been unable to win because of the disappointing bowling attack. Apart from Mohammed Shami, all the others have failed to take wickets. Come Thursday, Sunrisers, blessed with a strong top order comprising Jonny Bairstow, David Warner, Manish Pandey and Kane Williamson, will look to exploit the KXIP’s bowling unit. Having lost the opening two games due to the middle order, Sunrisers brought in Williamson to the playing XI. Skipper Warner backed youngsters Abhishek Sharma and Abdul Samad to fill in for the fifth bowler’s slot and it paid off.  However, the team was dealt a massive blow when senior pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar was ruled out of the tournament with a thigh muscle injury.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/batsmen-hold-the-key-in-clash-between-kings-xi-and-sunrisers/article32798607.ece

08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||Fatal attraction||“If possible, I would have filled my house with Nepenthes (pitcher plants),” laughs Dr Payel Sarkar. At her home in Uran, Navi Mumbai, Payel grows different varieties of carnivorous plants; she also hosts workshops on these plants for school students. Payel is among a growing tribe of carnivorous plant growers in India. Says Partha Pratim Borah from Nagaon, Assam, “There were not many growers when I started collecting these 12 years ago, but things are different now.” Partha has over 10,000 plants in his ever-growing nursery, and last year, he resigned his job to devote more time to his collection. Besides Nepenthes, the varieties that are commonly grown and sold in India include Venus flytraps, Droseras (sundews), Utricularias (bladderworts), Pinguiculas (Butterworts) and Sarracenias (American Pitcher Plant). Wilson C Varghese, owner of Vinay Gardens in Kozhikode, Kerala, began his tryst with carnivorous plants two decades ago, during the inauguration of Malabar Botanical Garden and Institute for Plant Sciences in his hometown. “I spent Rs. 1,000 to get my first. Although rodents destroyed it a few months later, I could replant it,” says Wilson. Today, his nursery is a leading producer of hybrid species of Nepenthes, and he has a clientèle across India. Enigmatic flora Social media has played a huge role in popularising these plants. When Prajay Jervis Fernandes from Thane, Mumbai, started the Facebook community ‘Carnivorous Plants India’ five years ago, it was out of a desire to find fellow hobbyists. “The community now has over 1,600 members, and is a forum for sellers and for new growers to clear their doubts,” says the 33-year-old, whose favourite is a Nepenthes that “does not kill”. The lower surface of the lid contains a sweet sugary laxative which is tempting for tree shrews. It causes them to involuntarily poop inside the pitcher. This poop is high in nitrogen, thus providing the nutrient for the plant, he adds. The collectors note that the world of carnivorous plants is mysterious. They argue that there is more to them than what our science classes in school have let on. “I consider them intelligent and sophisticated. Even humans and animals have to go in search of food, but they get it delivered directly. Their morphological features are bizarre in the most beautiful way, and some of them have the loveliest flowers,” says N Nirmal Kumar, a gardening enthusiast from Kochi, who owns a terrarium of carnivorous plants, and runs the YouTube channel, Nandanam Exotics, dedicated to gardening. These plants are grown from seeds, from cuttings and by tissue culture. Seeds or plants are imported from Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Americas and Europe. Rates differ as per variety. Sundews are priced Rs. 250 onwards; the cost of Nepenthes start at Rs. 600 and can go up to several thousands. Venus flytraps and Sarracenia cost upwards of Rs. 700. Meanwhile, a pack of seeds cost around Rs. 300. “Refrain from buying seeds from unknown or unverified sellers on e-commerce platforms, as there can be fake or old seeds in the consignment,” adds Prajay. Hooked to the hobby The plants require good sunlight and the soil should be nutrient free. Coco peat and sphagnum moss are preferred options. No fertiliser should be applied. Water used should be devoid of dissolved solids or minerals. Experienced growers even create new varieties by crossing breeds through manual pollination, but it is not easy. “Female plants are few when compared to their male counterparts and you can only differentiate them when they flower. However, flowering doesn’t happen often, and the flowers are so small that you have to use a paint brush to handle the pollen,” says Wilson. There are varieties that require cold winters to enter dormancy stage. Creating artificial conditions, then, is the solution. While certain collectors have their own incubators, keeping them in the fridge (for at least two months) is another option. However, the tedious process involved in nurturing the plant has not affected its demand. For instance, Lakshmi Ashok Kumar, facilitator with a learning community in Kochi, cultivated Utricularia in the small pond at her home without knowing what it was. “Now I look forward to collecting more varieties and studying about the species,” she says. And once you get hooked, you tend to become greedy. Partha and Nirmal look forward to adding the Australian pitcher plant to their collection, even though they are expensive and need extremely cold conditions to thrive. “For me, having a carnivorous plant is the closest I can get to owning a pet,” says Prajay, adding “Since these plants are rare and some are getting extinct, having them gives me a sense of satisfaction.”  It’s a trap! Since they thrive in less fertile, marshy lands, carnivorous plants have adapted themselves to gain nutrients by capturing and digesting their prey. Pitcher plants have pitfall traps, while sundews capture prey with beads of sticky glue. Venus flytrap has hinged leaves like tiny jaws that snap shut around its prey. Bladderworts, primarily aquatic, have underwater traps and use a vacuum action to suck insects into the trap. India is home to only one Nepenthes species, Nepenthes khasiana , which is endangered. 99% of carnivorous plants fall into endangered category. Some have gone extinct because their beauty and trapping mechanisms have led to large scale poaching. Shrinking habitats, due to human intervention, also destroy them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/fatal-attraction/article32799152.ece
08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||Arabian delight||“A photograph is a poem about time,” says Hasnain Ahmed; the photographer will be exhibiting a collection of his photos titled Colours Of Arabia in Chennai on October 9. “Photographs can capture a moment in time that is gone forever, or capture a moment in history for future generations. They can also change behaviour and stimulate understanding between people,” he adds. He holds up a photograph he has taken of Al Jahili Fort, which he explains is one of the largest forts in the United Arab Emirates built in the late 19th Century by Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa (1835-1909), as a royal summer residence. There are also vivid, colourful images of an old Iranian carpet shop, the Dubai Souk and the Creek Side market, where exotic spices, oud and perfumes are sold. “ Oud is sourced from the wood of the agar tree which when infected with a particular type of mould, produces a warm, woody, smoky fragrance that is highly sought after. The Arabs call it ‘liquid gold’,” he says. Connecting cultures Colours Of Arabia is a collection that shows the different faces of the UAE and its swank cities, a few miles from which lie large swathes of empty desert where the Bedouins live, like they have for centuries. “My intention was to bring to the people of India various images from the Middle East, and also do a Colours Of India photo exhibition in the Middle East. My hope is that these images will bring the people of the two regions together, as I feel that there are a lot of similarities between us in terms of food, family values, the hospitality we extend to our guests...” says Hasnain, who is the nephew of the current Nawab of Arcot. He grew up in Chennai at the Amir Mahal Palace in Royapettah, and is a descendant of the second Prince of Arcot, Nawab Zaheer-ud-Daulah Bahadur. “Growing up in Chennai and visiting my grandparents in Saudi, and my extended family in UAE, I felt at home in all these places. I think there is more that we have in common than what separates us,” says Hasnain. Looking back The turning point in his life was when his father gifted him a Panasonic digital camera when he was in Class X. Hasnain says, “I was an average student, and not too interested in academics. The camera opened up a new world for me — a world of light, shadows, colours and stories.” He learnt photography from the Mind School Film Institute, Chennai, founded by filmmaker Rajiv Menon. “I subsequently did advanced professional photography and film making courses from IFTA, Mumbai and the Gulf Photo Plus Institute in Dubai,” he adds. He started his own production house, Hasnain Ahmed Productions, in 2018, and now does corporate and documentary films, music videos and short films for clients in India, the UAE and the UK.  Colours Of Arabiais open to the public from 5pm on October 9 at Hotel GRT in T Nagar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/arabian-delight/article32799151.ece

08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||A new bag of t ri cks||It is a Saturday evening, and Arun the mentalist — or ATM, as he calls himself — has his eyes focussed on the camera. He is ready to unleash one of his most popular tricks on the 50-plus audience who have turned up for his live virtual show on Zoom. He writes on a piece of paper, and places it inside a bowl that everyone can see. He then requests volunteers from the audience, and three — from different parts of the world, unrelated to each other — give answers to three questions: favourite holiday destination, what they would eat there and the rough cost of this dinner. Minutes later, Arun opens that piece of paper and shows the world that he had already predicted these answers: the US, curd rice and $99, plus tax. The audience unmute themselves and clap in disbelief. From his modest Villivakkam residence in Chennai, Arun Loganathan grins widely as he bows in acknowledgement. For Arun and many of his peers in the magic-mentalist industry, the world has opened up online to witness their magic that unfolds in their drawing rooms. When the pandemic and lockdown hit, most of the corporate world adapted to a rigorous WFH routine. But the transition was not so smooth for magicians and performers, who thrive on the energy and allure of the stage. A new act Delhi-based illusionist Karan Singh, who has been performing since 2008, used the lockdown to write a new show: one that would include new tricks for online performances. “Writing a show generally takes six to eight months but due to the increased frequency of the performances during lockdown, I could do it in a few weeks,” he says. He has been presenting that, and doing magic videos in collaboration with comedians and influencers like Samay Raina, Tanmay Bhat and Bhuvan Bam for the past months. Karan believes that the pandemic has opened up a world of possibilities for performers. “It is a little difficult for magicians as they require a bigger space and props, but for mentalists who can read your mind and figure out your ATM pin or phone password, a corner of the house is enough,” says Karan, who adds that he is going the extra mile to adapt to international performances — he recently performed at 3am IST for audiences in the US and the UK. Mumbai-based Naman Anand is a relatively new entrant in the magic space; he started his professional career with virtual shows earlier this year, after many years of dabbling in it as a hobby. “During virtual shows, every person feels like they have a prized front-row seat,” says Naman. Nikhil Raj has been doing something similar from Bengaluru; the illusionist has been trying to incorporate elements of comedy in his online shows, which revolve around mentalism and conjuring. “In one of my initial shows, a member of the audience pointed out that I was doing tricks using props from my desk. Since then, I tell audiences to keep something ready in their house; objects like pen, paper and phone, and try to perform a trick using that,” adds Nikhil, who has been busy these last few months, with over 35 virtual sessions. Preparation for such online shows requires time, effort and money. Arun took a ride to Ritchie Street, Chennai’s well-known electronics hub, to purchase a couple of lights, a microphone and a green screen. He converted a part of his bedroom to a studio containing a two-camera setup. “My home is my stage now,” beams Arun, who also attempted a blindfold act virtually. The wow factor With such virtual shows being the new normal, how do magicians plan their future performances? Addressing this question was the legendary magician David Copperfield, who spoke about various challenges on a recent Facebook Live hosted by Chennai-based popular magician SAC Vasanth. Vasanth, who has done numerous TV shows involving magic, might be popular for being the “man who predicted Garry Kasparov’s next move” but the last few months sans live stage shows have been a challenge. “The transition was difficult,” he admits, “Even on a live stage, we are asked a hundred questions. On an online platform, we need to convince audiences. Believability is a big factor. David [Copperfield] stressed about the need to pick your genre of magic, and improve presentation skills.” Vasanth seems to have cracked that; since March, he has done more than 30 virtual shows, most of them ticketed. “We keep it limited to 25 tickets, priced at Rs. 2,000 each for a one-hour show. The advantage is that everyone in the family can gather around the laptop and enjoy the show.” For such events, he does tricks connecting all 25 people — they each think of a number that adds up to one grand number, which Vasanth reveals he had predicted on his Instagram page a day before! He concludes, “Magic is all about making people happy. That’s what matters.”  (With inputs from   Aishwarya Upadhye)   Some performers are writing exclusive tricks meant for an online audience||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-new-bag-of-t-ri-cks/article32799147.ece
08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||When humour meets cricket||The IPL has been a welcome relief for sports fans after a few months of unrelenting COVID-related updates. But what has kept fans across Tamil Nadu glued to their TV sets every evening is RJ Balaji’s wisecracks and comic punchlines, which have made even boring matches watchable. “The response [to Tamil commentary] has been amazing. 2020 has been such a dismal year that we wanted the IPL to cheer up people. And it has,” says Balaji, over phone from Mumbai. In particular, Balaji has received congratulatory messages from people who say that his gags have lifted their spirits in these troubled times. “My biggest strength is that I am not pretending to be someone else. I have earned this acceptance because of my stint in media for the past 15 years. Also, the sport has evolved; cricket has become family entertainment and that is where I come in.” He believes that the couple of hours he spends on air during IPL matches adds spice to this entertainment, and regales families who have tuned in for cricket. “We get preparatory material before the match so I know the basics. But I leave the cricket talk to the experts and indulge in humour,” adds Balaji. His on-the-spot jokes are widely shared on social media and WhatsApp groups. Among his popular comments are those that follow a sixer: “The ball is lost, and it costs Rs. 15,000, and if I had that, I would have paid the electricity bill for the month.” He is also popular for his pronunciation of cricketers’ names: Eoin Morgan and Rahul Tewatia’s names roll off Balaji’s tongue in a unique manner. “I reflect everyday life in cricket commentary. I see myself as a reflection of people,” he says. The RJ-actor has been associated with Star Sports Tamil since its launch in 2017, but this year has been different. “So many people are working behind the scenes to bring you live action. We want everyone to be safe, and so they get tested for COVID-19 every week. When we landed, we were locked in the room for 14 days and we are in a bio-bubble now. There are several protocols, but that is required to feel safe and keep us going for the next few weeks.” Balaji’s stint so far has been largely filled with fun and humour, but the one event that left him in shock was the sudden passing away of Australian cricketer-turned-commentator Dean Jones. “Just the night before, he was talking to us about the busy cricket calendar in 2021, and how he would find it difficult to juggle between his commitments. I told him these exact words, ‘You don’t know what is going to happen in the next few days. How can you plan so far ahead?’ The next day, I woke up to the news of his death. It left me devastated.” The subsequent passing away of singer SP Balasubrahmanyam marked a sad phase for Balaji, but the show must go on, as they say, and Balaji sported his usual cheerful self on air during a week in which he was feeling gloomy. “It was difficult but TV is a live medium through which we convey our mood to millions of people watching it,” says the actor, whose co-commentators include Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Hemang Badani, Abhinav Mukund, Subramaniam Badrinath, Pradeep Muthu and Radha Krishnan. Fans of Tamil commentary will miss him for the next couple of weeks as Balaji is on leave. He does not reveal the reason for his absence, but sources say it is to finalise release plans for his upcoming film, Mookuthi Amman , starring Nayanthara. So, how is that coming along? “The film is complete, but even if theatres open, I’m not sure how families will visit cinema halls. My film is a family entertainer, and we are waiting for the right time to make announcements,” he says, adding “For now, there’s cricket to enjoy.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/when-humour-meets-cricket/article32799150.ece

But in the undertaking of this project lies a sacrificed dream. In December last year, Vivek moved into his new boutique on Rutland Gate, a glitzy 1,500 square feet space. “I held on to the space for a long time. But after five months of uncertainty, I had to take a tough call and close it,” says Vivek. However, the situation pushed him to reinvent. Now, his boutique is at the Hyatt Regency, in a cosy 500-square-feet hotel room. The bed has been moved, a little space has been converted into a changing room, and racks bearing his collections occupy much of the room. Given the times, Vivek says his new retail set-up at the Hyatt is operationally more convenient than a standalone store, as “the hotel in its trademark manner handles the nitty gritties like maintenance and generator, among others.” Says Vivek, “The idea came up in conversation with Tarun Sethi, general manager of the hotel, and we are excited about exploring this option.” For now, he is meeting customers by appointment only. “We sanitise the space after each appointment,” he states. With a studio in Neelankarai, Vivek says that he requires a space in the city to meet clients. “In this new generation, this is how we roll... We are trying to figure out if luxury can be reinvented.” His clients have been trickling in every other day. Some have specific needs like wedding garments, some visit to show support, and the rest are people who are restless after months of lockdown, and just want to shop. “The whole process of them billing helps keep us and our artisans alive,” says Vivek Vivek has built his eponymous brand over 14 years, and is determined to keep going. Given the scenario, the designer believes it is important to be be practical rather than emotional about business decisions. “I feel like today, surviving is the most important,” he says. “If we survive now we will sustain, if we sustain we will thrive.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/seams-like-luxury/article32799142.ece
08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||Lake on the coast||Against a sea of ink blue stands Caernarfon Castle, built by Edward I in 1283, in Gwynedd county, Wales. In another frozen moment, shades of pink, purple and warm orange caress the serene shores of Snettisham Beach in Norfolk as the sun sets. For British photographer Quintin Lake, these sights sum up the diversity of Britain’s coast, along which he had been walking for 455 days, since 2015. Four hundred and fifty five days on the trail; 268 days of photo editing; and many months of planning led to Quintin’s project The Perimeter: a collection of photographs that capture the landscapes that together make Britain’s coast. On April 17, 2015, he started in London, walking clockwise for 445 days: of which, 200 days were spent in Scotland, 60 in Wales and the rest in England. Lake, who started off as a commercial landscape photographer almost 20 years back, says he loves being outside.” In an email interview, the photographer — who is now at his home in London — says “To be in the landscape, rather than inside, feels connected to the cosmos... and it’s this connection to things bigger than ourselves that fascinates and satisfies me.” The inspiration for The Perimeter came from earlier projects, in which Lake walked along rivers Thames and Severn from the source to the sea. “When I got to the coastal sections, I was really inspired by the diversity of what I was seeing. I felt this was the key to see Britain with fresh eyes,” he recalls. The British coast, he adds, juxtaposes so many different things in quick succession. Though Britain is a small island, it has a vast coastline: one-fourth of the circumference of the globe. Its varied geology and history give rise to varied landforms, vegetation, dialects and this difference also seeps into their appearances. “Walking the British coast felt like a beautifully choreographed piece of music – one or two weeks had a particular flavour and then that flavour would change and the topography changes at a walking pace.” But, why did he choose to walk? A lot of Scotland that comprised 200 days of his trail had no defined path, thanks to its mountainous terrain. “If I felt the storm in my face for a few days, and I felt the soil because I was sleeping on it, then I could also feel the pictures better. I find that if I drive somewhere to take pictures, then I end up taking postcard views,” says Lake. Lake’s journey along the Knoydart Peninsula in Scotland was the toughest but also, the most beautiful. As the mountains fall steeply into the sea, the easiest route in this pathless terrain is through mountain ridges and passes. “As it was winter, four hours of everyday involved night hiking with a head torch and each evening, I poured water out of my boots and peeled off wet clothes before entering the sleeping bag,” he recalls. On the other hand, Scotland in summer was swarmed by midges, which made cooking and resting a great challenge, he says. Another unforgettable experience was in Broomway, on a nine kilometre tidal path connecting the mainland to Foulness Island, which is known as England’s most dangerous path. “The tide comes in faster than a man can run and is affected by wind and air pressure.” he says, explaining that the path (which is invisible on the ground) must be followed very precisely as on one side there is sinking mud and on the other, there is unexploded ordnance. “When I walked it alone, the clouds were reflected in the wet mud like a mirror, so it felt like walking on water.” After a split tendon in his foot that took seven weeks to heal, shin splints and countless blisters he reached the track to Cape Wrath, Scotland’s remote Northwest location — the point of completion. It was midnight of Sepetember 15. An excerpt from his diary entry of the day reads, “I am overcome by relief and emotion and collapse to my knees to kiss the road in the pouring rain. Exhausted, I pitch the tent below the lighthouse as the beam swings diffused through the dense rain above. The gentle rumble of a generator blends with the rain as I fall asleep.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/lake-on-the-coast/article32799139.ece

This poop is high in nitrogen, thus providing the nutrient for the plant, Prajay adds. The collectors note that the world of carnivorous plants is mysterious. They argue that there is more to them than what our science classes in school have taught us. “I consider them intelligent and sophisticated. Even humans and animals have to go in search of food, but they get it delivered directly. Their morphological features are bizarre in the most beautiful way, and some of them have the loveliest flowers,” says N. Nirmal Kumar, a gardening enthusiast from Kochi, Kerala, who owns a terrarium of carnivorous plants, and runs the YouTube channel, Nandanam Exotics, which is dedicated to gardening. These plants are grown from seeds, from cuttings and by tissue culture. Seeds or plants are imported from Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Americas and Europe. Rates differ as per variety. Sundews are priced at Rs. 250 onwards; Nepenthes start at Rs. 600 and can go up to several thousands. Venus flytraps and Sarracenia cost upwards of Rs. 700. Meanwhile, a pack of seeds costs around Rs. 300. “Refrain from buying seeds from unknown or unverified sellers on e-commerce platforms, as there can be fake or old seeds in the consignment,” adds Prajay. Hooked to the hobby The plants require good sunlight and the soil should be nutrient-free. Coco peat and sphagnum moss are preferred options. No fertiliser should be applied. The water used should be devoid of dissolved solids or minerals. Experienced growers even create new varieties by crossing breeds through manual pollination, but it is not easy. “Female plants are few when compared to their male counterparts and you can only differentiate them when they flower. However, flowering doesn’t happen often, and the flowers are so small that you have to use a paint brush to handle the pollen,” says Wilson. There are varieties that require cold winters to enter dormancy stage. Creating artificial conditions, then, is the solution. While certain collectors have their own incubators, keeping them in the fridge (for at least two months) is another option. However, the tedious process involved in nurturing the plant has not affected its demand. For instance, Lakshmi Ashok Kumar, facilitator with a learning community in Kochi, cultivated Utricularia in the small pond at her home without knowing what it was. “Now I look forward to collecting more varieties and studying about the species,” she says. And once you get hooked, you tend to become greedy. Partha and Nirmal look forward to adding the Australian pitcher plant to their collection, even though they are expensive and need extremely cold conditions to thrive. “For me, having a carnivorous plant is the closest I can get to owning a pet,” says Prajay, adding, “Since these plants are rare and some are getting extinct, having them gives me a sense of satisfaction.”  It’s a trap! Since they thrive in less fertile and marshy lands, carnivorous plants have adapted themselves to gain nutrients by capturing and digesting their prey. Pitcher plants have pitfall traps, while sundews capture prey with beads of sticky glue. Venus flytrap has hinged leaves like tiny jaws that snap shut around its prey. Bladderworts, primarily aquatic, have underwater traps and use a vacuum action to suck insects into the trap. India is home to only one Nepenthes species, Nepenthes khasiana , which is endangered. 99% of carnivorous plants fall into the endangered category. Some have gone extinct because their beauty and trapping mechanisms have led to large scale poaching. Shrinking habitats, due to human intervention, also destroy them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/fatal-attraction/article32798823.ece
08 October 2020||October 08 2020 00:00 IST,||Arabian delight||“A photograph is a poem about time,” says photographer Hasnain Ahmed, who will be exhibiting a collection of his photos titled ‘Colours Of Arabia’ in Chennai on October 9. “Photographs can capture a moment in time that is gone forever, or capture a moment in history for future generations. They can also change behaviour and stimulate understanding between people,” he adds. He holds up a photograph he has taken of Al Jahili Fort, which he explains is one of the largest forts in the United Arab Emirates. It was built in the late 19th century by Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa (1835-1909) as a royal summer residence. There are also vivid, colourful images of an old Iranian carpet shop, the Dubai Souk and the Creek Side market, where exotic spices, oud and perfumes are sold. “ Oud is sourced from the wood of the agar tree, which when infected with a particular type of mould, produces a warm, woody, smoky fragrance that is highly sought after. The Arabs call it ‘liquid gold’,” he says. Connecting cultures ‘Colours Of Arabia’ is a collection that shows the different faces of the UAE and its swank cities, a few miles from which lie large swathes of empty desert where the Bedouins live, like they have for centuries. “My intention was to bring to the people of India various images from the Middle East, and also do a ‘Colours Of India’ photo exhibition in the Middle East. My hope is that these images will bring the people of the two regions together, as I feel that there are a lot of similarities between us in terms of food, family values, the hospitality we extend to our guests...” says Hasnain, who is the nephew of the current Nawab of Arcot. He grew up in Chennai at the Amir Mahal Palace in Royapettah, and is a descendant of the second Prince of Arcot, Nawab Zaheer-ud-Daulah Bahadur. “Growing up in Chennai and visiting my grandparents in Saudi, and my extended family in UAE, I felt at home in all these places. I think there is more that we have in common than what separates us,” says Hasnain The turning point in his life was when his father gifted him a Panasonic digital camera when he was in Class X. He says, “I was an average student, and not too interested in academics. The camera opened up a new world for me — a world of light, shadows, colours and stories.” He learnt photography from the Mind School Film Institute, Chennai, founded by filmmaker Rajiv Menon. “I subsequently did advanced professional photography and film-making courses from IFTA, Mumbai, and the Gulf Photo Plus Institute in Dubai,” Hasnain adds. He started his own production house, Hasnain Ahmed Productions, in 2018, and now does corporate and documentary films, music videos and short films for clients in India, the UAE and the U.K.  Colours Of Arabiais open to the public from 5 p.m. on October 9 at Hotel GRT in T Nagar, Chennai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/arabian-delight/article32798817.ece
08 October 2020||Chandigarh,||Farmer groups reject Centre’s invite for ‘talks’ on agri laws||Farmer outfits in Punjab on Wednesday collectively turned down the invitation of the Central government to attend a meeting, slated for October 8, “to address the concerns” surrounding the three agriculture sector laws.  Meeting of 30 outfits Members of as many as 30 farmer outfits held a meeting here, in which it was decided that farmers would not participate in any meeting as the government’s approach seems to be “non-serious” towards addressing farmers’ concerns. “We have rejected the invitation extended by Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agarwal to several members of different outfits for the conference. The language of the letter sent to us indicated that the meeting was not for any conversation or discussion on the farm laws. But it seems a call from the Agriculture Secretary to explain the benefits of these laws to the farmers,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bhartaiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda). “It shows the non-serious approach of the government,” he added. Mr. Singh said farmer outfits had also decided to continue their ‘rail-roko’ agitation across the State. “It was also decided that if the Punjab government did not convene an Assembly session by October 15 to repeal the agriculture sector laws, we will start boycotting Congress leaders in the same way as the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) leaders are being boycotted,” he said.  Impact, implementation The Secretary, Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, government of India, had written to representatives of different farmer organisations, inviting them for a meeting in New Delhi on October 8, to address the concerns regarding the impact and implementation of new farm laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/farmer-groups-reject-centres-invite-for-talks-on-agri-laws/article32798841.ece
08 October 2020||New Delhi,||‘Reply to plea challenging classification of law offices’||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought response of the three municipal corporations of the national capital on a petition by the Delhi High Court Bar Association (DHCBA) challenging classification of law offices as “commercial activity” for the purposes of calculation of property tax under the Delhi Municipal Act. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan asked the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, East Delhi Municipal Corporation and North Delhi Municipal Corporation for their stand on the petition. The DHCBA’s petition stated, “A professional activity like an advocate is not a business and cannot be deemed as a commercial activity and as such, the non-residential rates would not apply in the case of an advocate using premises for an office”. It explained that the municipal corporation of Delhi attributes a use factor to a building depending upon its purpose. The use factor varies from, 1 (for residential purpose and public purpose) to 10 for star hotels (3 stars and above). The use factor for industry, entertainment, recreation and clubs has been specified as 3 and that of utilities and business as 2 and 4 respectively. The Bar Council of Delhi had sent a representation on July 21, 2020 to the civic corporations for reduction of use factor 4 to 1 for levy of property tax in respect of offices of advocates in Delhi. “The respondents [civic corporations] being the assessing authority has conveniently ignored the law laid down by the apex court regarding profession of advocates which by no stretch of imagination comes in the category of commercial enterprise, industrial, mercantile, shop or business venture,” the petition stated. “A lawyer does not render services, conduct business or commercial activities,” the plea said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/reply-to-plea-challenging-classification-of-law-offices/article32798961.ece
08 October 2020||Guwahati,||Ex-Assam DIG in CID custody||A court in Guwahati on Wednesday gave the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) custody of former Deputy Inspector General of Assam police Prasanta Kumar Dutta for six days. The retired DIG, one of the prime accused in the leaking of question papers for appointing 597 unarmed sub inspectors, was arrested by the West Bengal police from Kakarbhitta on the India-Nepal border on Tuesday. The CID had sought a week’s custody but the court of the chief judicial magistrate prescribed six days. The court also directed the CID to check Mr. Dutta’s health at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital before interrogation. The former DIG had tested negative for COVID-19 hours after a police team that fetched him from northern West Bengal on Tuesday night. The police, however, told the court that he was suffering from high blood pressure, diabetes and cardiac problem.  Jobs for cash Mr. Dutta and suspended Bharatiya Janata Party leader Diban Deka had allegedly assured jobs to many candidates for cash. Handwritten copies of the leaked question paper were given to 50 job aspirants who sat for the “written test” at a guesthouse in Guwahati on September 19, a day ahead of schedule. Some 66,000 candidates had started answering the questions on the scheduled date when the exam was questioned following a social media upload of the leaked question paper. The “recruitment scam” saw retired IPS officer Deepak Kumar quit as the chairman of the State Level Police Recruitment Board, which later rescheduled the date for the written test to November 22. At least 24 people, including the former DIG and the BJP leader have been arrested for the question paper leak.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ex-assam-dig-in-cid-custody/article32798839.ece
08 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||U.P. govt. inks agreement with Swiss firm for Jewar airport||The Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday signed a concession agreement with representatives of Zurich Airport International for designing, building and operating the Noida International Airport at Jewar for a period of 40 years. The airport will be developed on Public-Private Partnership (PPP) basis and is scheduled to open in 2024. It will be located at a distance of 70 kms from Delhi, 40 kms from Noida and 130 kms from Agra. “We are targeting the first six months for financial closures and the next 36 months for completion of the first phase of airport with a capacity of 1.2 crore passengers per annum. The project will be constructed with an initial investment of Rs. 4,588 crore for the first phase,” Daniel Bircher, Chief Executive Officer, Zurich Airport International Asia, told The Hindu in an e-mail. The airport will open with a single runway, but once it is fully developed by 2040, it will have two runways and will have a capacity of 7 crore passengers per annum. Land for expansion The airport will be developed on 1,334 hectares of land and the U.P. government has reserved an additional 5,000 hectares for airport expansion, Mr. Bircher added. Zurich Airport International AG (ZAIA) won the contract to build and operate the airport for a period of 40 years last November. ZAIA received the security clearance from the Ministry of Home Affairs in May this year. To a question on whether another international airport so close to one in the national capital will be viable, Mr Bircher replied, “The Noida international airport will be a visionary airport for Delhi NCR, Noida and Western U.P., which will activate the catchment area and connect it to other metropolitan areas in India and the world. We see Noida International airport as complementary and an efficient alternative to Indira Gandhi International Airport which is set to reach its peak capacity of 11 crore in the next six or seven years”. The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority has also shared plans to link the airport with Yamuna Expressway, Metro and Western Peripheral Expressway.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/up-govt-inks-agreement-with-swiss-firm-for-jewar-airport/article32798842.ece
08 October 2020||JAIPUR,||‘Road map ready for National Education Policy in Rajasthan’||The road map for the National Education Policy-2020 was ready in the universities in Rajasthan, where the implementation would be done in a phased manner, Governor Kalraj Mishra, who is Chancellor of the State-funded universities, said here on Tuesday.

08 October 2020||Guwahati,||Christian group flays pastor’s arrest in Arunachal||A Christian organisation in Arunachal Pradesh has slammed the authorities of Buddhist-dominated Tawang for the arrest of a pastor on charges of illegally constructing a church. Joseph Singhi was arrested on October 6 and released on bail hours later. The local police had also detained and recorded the statements of eight of his associates. Tawang’s Additional Deputy Commissioner Lobsang Tsering said the arrest was made on the basis of a first information report lodged by the district Land Revenue and Survey officer. The action followed complaints by two groups — the Indigenous Faith and Cultural Society of Arunachal Pradesh and Monpa (dominant Buddhist community) Mimang Tsogpa — against the pastor and others for allegedly constructing a Revival Church illegally. The church is located behind the district planning officer’s quarters in Tawang’s AIR Colony. The minuscule Christian community in the district claimed the church has stood there since they occupied the plot in 1999 with the department concerned “ignoring their application for land allotment initiated in 2003”. “We were assured allotment of the piece of land after we met Chief Minister Pema Khandu and Chief Secretary [Naresh Kumar] in August. We started construction of the church out of frustration,” said Sonara Degio, vice-president of the Arunachal Pradesh Christian Revival Church Council (APCRCC). “Pastor Singhi and the Christian community here are under stress,” Mr. Degio told The Hindu from Tawang, about 450 km northwest of capital Itanagar. A district official said the pastor had been served several notices to stop the construction of the church and dismantle the structures. The last such issue on the basis of a Supreme Court directive was served in 2017. The apex court had on September 29, 2009 said no unauthorised construction shall be permitted in the name of temple, church, mosque, gurudwara or any other place of worship on public facilities. The APCRCC said the district authorities invoked the Arunachal Pradesh Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupant) Act, 2003, after Mr. Singhi had allegedly failed to comply with the order to stop construction. Work on the church had started in 2015. APCRCC president Tai Ete said the police action was ‘unjust’ since public spaces have been used in the State for structures associated with other faiths. The district authorities denied targeting any particular community. Officials said land allotments issued to many private and public parties have been cancelled in more than a decade.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/christian-group-flays-pastors-arrest-in-arunachal/article32798846.ece

08 October 2020||CHANDIGARH,||Police detain, later release farmers in Sirsa||The police in Haryana’s Sirsa on Wednesday morning detained around 70 people, most of them farmers, who were squatting on a road leading to Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala’s residence, demanding his resignation from the post against the Centre’s agriculture sector laws. The protesters were released late in the evening. The agitating farmers announced to resume their sit-in close to Mr. Chautala’s residence. “Finally, after 10 hours, everyone was released unconditionally. Farmers to resume their dharna. A small step for farmer activists, a big leap for farmers’ movement. Congratulations!,” said Swaraj India’s national president Yogendra Yadav, who was also detained. Sirsa DSP Aryan Chaudhary confirmed that the protesters have been released. Earlier, Sirsa SP Bhupender Singh said, “We had detained around 70 people who were squatting on a road since Tuesday night, close to Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala’s residence, causing inconvenience to the public. Most farmers had left after yesterday’s protest. We are investigating if any ‘anti-social’ elements are among the group.” Mr. Yadav said the State government was rattled by the farmers’ agitation and was using force against them. “I have been detained by the Haryana police for joining peaceful dharna at Sirsa. About 100 farmers and leaders were arrested.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/police-detain-later-release-farmers-in-sirsa/article32798849.ece
