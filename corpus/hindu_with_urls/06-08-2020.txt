06 August 2020||AYODHYA,||Modern symbol of Indian culture: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday formally launched the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, saying it would serve as a “modern symbol of Indian culture” and with it, the country was creating a golden chapter for itself. Ram Janmabhoomi, the birthplace of Lord Ram as believed by Hindus, had been liberated from the cycle of “breaking and rising up again” that had been going on for centuries, Mr. Modi said, terming it a “historic” moment. “The centuries of wait is getting over today,” he said after performing thebhoomi pujanfor the temple here in a tightly-arranged event held amid COVID-19 pandemic. A grand temple would be built for “our Ram Lalla”, who had to live under a tent for years, the Prime Minister said, stressing that crores of people could hardly believe this was happening during their lifetime. ‘Eternal faith’ Mr. Modi emphasised the word “modern,” and said the Ram temple would become a symbol of “our eternal faith,” national sentiments and collective willpower of crores of people. “This temple will inspire the coming generations about faith, reverence and resolve,” he said, adding that the temple would not only augment the grandeur of Ayodhya but also change the economy of the entire region. New opportunities would emerge as people would come for a darshan of Lord Ram and Mata Janaki from around the world, the Prime Minister said. The formal start of the temple’s construction comes almost 28 years after Babri Masjid was demolished by a mob of ‘kar sevaks’ on December 6, 1992.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/modern-symbol-of-indian-culture-modi/article32281312.ece
06 August 2020||PARAMAKUDI,||Man faints at police station, dies; probe reveals he was assaulted by neighbours||A man fainted at a police station in Paramakudi and died at nearby hospital on Wednesday triggering tension for a while. However, Ramanthapuram Superintendent of Police V. Varun Kumar, who conducted a probe, said the man had suffered internal injuries in an assault by his neighbours and died as a result. According to the SP, D. Koodalingam, 29, of Patel Street, had come to the station in the afternoon seeking to file a complaint against his neighbour. Sub-Inspector Kumaresan asked him to wait as he was inquiring into another case. In the meantime, Koodalingam fainted and the police personnel at the station took him to a nearby hospital where doctors declared him dead, Mr. Varun Kumar said.  Civil dispute Following this, the police visited his house where they learnt that he had a civil dispute with one of his neighbours, Palkarasu, over sharing of a pathway. About three months ago, a court had given judgement in favour of Koodalingam’s father Dorairaj. They had started cleaning up the pathway on Wednesday when Palkarasu and his relatives allegedly assaulted him with bricks and stones. A police officer said Koodalingam had suffered multiple internal injuries. The SP said a video clip of the incident made by a neighbour and subsequent inquiry with the accused enabled in solving the case. Paramakudi Town Police have registered a case of murder and arrested Palkarasu (52) and four others – Dharmar (36), Sureshkumar (33), Kanthimathi (45) and Murugan (48). They were produced before a judicial magistrate court and remanded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/man-faints-at-police-station-dies-probe-reveals-he-was-assaulted-by-neighbours/article32281722.ece

06 August 2020||HYDERABAD,||New policy to encourage jobs for locals||The design of the new Secretariat complex was among several decisions taken at a marathon Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Wednesday. The Cabinet cleared a new policy to encourage a larger share of employment for locals in industries by giving the units additional incentives. The meeting which was still going on when a few decisions were released to media after eight hours of sitting observed that a number of industrial units were set up in the State in the wake of its industrial policy — TS-iPASS (Telangana State Industrial Project Approval and Self-Certification Systems) — implemented after formation of Telangana State with a view to speeding up clearances. Mr. Rao had recently instructed authorities to frame a draft policy ensuring that the youth of Telangana got more employment opportunities in such industries. The Cabinet discussed the draft in detail and approved it, a release said. The meeting also passed Growth in Dispersion (GID) policy aimed to give additional incentives to IT industries that were set up in areas other than the western parts of Hyderabad comprising the Hi-Tech city. The Cabinet felt IT sector should not be concentrated in one part of the city but expand in four directions. The Cabinet resolved to encourage use of electric vehicles to check air pollution caused by growth in vehicle population. It was decided to encourage setting up of electric vehicles manufacturing industries by giving them additional incentives. In this context, a policy ‘Telangana State Electric Vehicle and Energy Storage Solution’ was passed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/new-policy-to-encourage-jobs-for-locals/article32281592.ece
06 August 2020||Srinagar,||Kashmir under security blanket||Security was tightened across the Kashmir Valley on Wednesday to foil a scheduled meeting and protest marches by the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on the first anniversary of the withdrawal of J&K’s special status. NC president and Member of Parliament Farooq Abdullah had called a meeting of all regional parties on Wednesday at his residence on Gupkar Road “to chalk out the future course of action”. The move apparently was to carry forward the Gupkar Declaration signed on August 4, 2019, by the regional parties, which called for “a joint front to defend J&K’s special status”. However, security was beefed up on the Gupkar Road, housing Dr. Abdullah’s residence, and barricades put up. “Police vehicles are opposite our gates, concertina wire strung across the road at regular intervals and no vehicles allowed. My father had called a meeting of leaders of mainstream parties to deliberate on the current situation,” said NC vice-president Omar Abdullah. He said the scheduled meeting was not allowed to go ahead. “The BJP gets to announce a 15-day celebration to mark 5th Aug and a handful of us aren’t allowed to meet on my father’s lawn. So much for BJP national leaders wondering why there is no political activity,” Mr. Abdullah tweeted. Sources said all those who were supposed to attend the meeting had been placed under house arrest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kashmir-under-security-blanket/article32281314.ece
06 August 2020||Bengaluru,||Night counselling may become permanent||Counsellors on the night shift of Parihar counselling centre in the Police Commissioner’s office recently received a call from a woman who was residing in the U.S. Forced to take a pay cut and work from home, her husband had become cranky and she was undergoing mental harassment, she said. She was unable to reach out to the local police there. In addition, her in-laws in Bengaluru were giving her a hard time and blaming her for their son sending them lesser money than usual. The counsellors reached out to her in-laws and helped resolve the situation. Ever since the counselling centre started night counselling two months ago - a first in its 27-year-old history - Parihar has been witnessing a steady rise in the number of calls, prompting it to think about making this a permanent feature. Rani Shetty, Parihar in-charge, told The Hindu that in June, there were 252 cases that came in at night. The number went up to 326 in July. “A majority of complaints, around 257, were from women, while 24 were from children and six were related to COVID-19. Most complaints were of domestic violence, followed by economic issues, cyber crime, alcoholic abuse, pre-marital issues, etc. There have been some POCSO complaints and some related to the child custody as well,” she said. Calls from other States There have been calls from other States as well. Recently, a woman caller had gone to her home State while relations were strained with her husband. Once the lockdown was lifted, she returned to Bengaluru. But her husband refused to take her in, citing COVID-19 as an excuse. The woman completed her quarantine period in a hotel and returned, but he again did not let her in saying there was a COVID-19 case in the family. Left with nowhere to go, she approached the night counsellors who got the police to intervene. After her husband refused to cooperate, she is now being housed in a shelter. “We are getting calls from other States also, mostly from relatives who can’t come here to help their family memberss in distress and call us for help. Night counselling has also proven to be mainly for crisis intervention where we have even successfully prevented a suicide attempt. A woman whose husband fought with her left, taking their child with him. The woman called us and our counsellors were able to intervene in time and prevent her from doing anything drastic. They also patched up the family,” said Ms. Shetty. The night counselling team consists of three counsellors working in each of the three shifts between 5 p.m. and 10 a.m. Going by the demand, the new feature is here to stay beyond the pandemic, especially given that there are not many options available for those in distress to reach out to at night, she added. Parihar family counselling centre/Vanitha Sahayavani can be reached at 22943224/5.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/night-counselling-may-become-permanent/article32281347.ece
06 August 2020||Kolkata,||Back home, migrant workers write to CM seeking new jobs||Sekh Suraj Ali, 25, a resident of Howrah's Udaynaraynpur block, used to earn Rs 15,000 a month working as a tailor in Kerala. Days before the nationwide lockdown was announced, with COVID-19 cases rising in Kerala, he returned to West Bengal. “I have had no work in West Bengal. So I have decided to write to the Chief Minister seeking some employment,” Mr. Ali told The Hindu . So far, around 300 migrant workers, who have returned to West Bengal amid the COVID-19 pandemic, have written to the State government seeking reemployment, social security and healthcare facilities. The initiative is backed by the West Bengal committee of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU). In just two weeks, the labour arm of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has set up a helpline number for migrant workers to reach out to the State government. CPI(M) worker Jaydeep Mukherjee, who is closely working with the CITU on the initiative, said an average of 50 people call every day. “A dedicated set of volunteers is engaged in collecting the details of each migrant worker. Personal details and nature of skills are recorded. Based on their immediate requirement, a petition is sent to the State government after taking their consent,” Mr. Mukherjee said. The committee sends the petition along with the details of each migrant worker to the Chief Minister's Office, the Chief Secretary and the Labour Department. CPI(M) leaders behind the initiative said the issue of migrant workers returning to the State amid the lockdown had dominated the political discourse in the month of May and June, but the government has not been taking stock of the situation. Mr. Mukherjee, who had served as confidential assistant to former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee during the Left Front regime, said the idea is also to make migrant workers aware of their rights and remind the State about its responsibility to provide them with social security and alternative employment. “Every worker is sending a separate petition, we are not aware whether any other organisation in the country has conducted such an elaborate exercise to help migrant workers,” Mr. Mukherjee said. According to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, over 10.5 lakh migrant workers have returned by the first week of June.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/back-home-migrant-workers-write-to-cm-seeking-new-jobs/article32281698.ece
06 August 2020||New Delhi,||Delhi HC asks lower court to decide on Brinda’s plea on hate speeches||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked a local court to decide CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat’s petition seeking lodging of FIRs against BJP leaders Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma for their alleged hate speeches in connection with the anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan issued the direction after Ms. Karat’s counsel sou-ght permission to contest her case before the local court. The counsel said the magisterial court had reserved its order on her plea on February 26, but did not pronounce it as similar issues were pending in the High Court. ‘Decide expeditiously’ The High Court asked the magisterial court to decide on Ms. Karat’s application “in accordance with law, rules and government policy applicable to the case, and as expeditiously as possible and practicable”. The court, whi-ch was hearing a bunch of petitions in connection with the north-east Delhi riots, posted the other petitions for hearing on August 24. Earlier, the Delhi police had stated that during their probe, “no actionable evidence has surfaced” against political leaders “instigating or participating in the riots”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/delhi-hc-asks-lower-court-to-decide-on-brindas-plea-on-hate-speeches/article32281511.ece

06 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Ministry dithers on decision to close LG Polymers||The Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) decided against closing down operations of the LG Polymers plant in Vishakapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, from where styrene gas leaked, killing at least 12 and causing 4,000 to take ill on May 7. This, even though a senior official in the Ministry recommended that the plant be closed citing Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act that allows the Centre to shut down industrial units that grossly violate the law. After the disaster, documents accessed via the Right to Information Act (RTI) show the MoEFCC convened a National Crisis Group with members from several Ministries and sought responses from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) and State authorities. The Environment Ministry also noted the previous history of the company. The chemical factory had been working since 1997 without appropriate clearances and had applied for clearance, in 2018, under rules made by the MoEFCC itself. These rules allow industrial projects in violation of environmental laws to apply to a special panel of experts called the ‘Violations Committee’ of the MoEFCC and — provided they meet certain criteria and make appropriate modifications — become compliant operations. LG Polymers had applied to this committee and its case was under consideration. On May 18, according to the records accessed by environmental activist Vikrant Tongad and viewed by The Hindu , Geeta Menon, Joint Secretary, MoEFCC, issued two drafts. One, that sought updated information from multiple agencies such as the Central Pollution Control Board, APPCB and the Chief Inspector of Factories on actions taken and whether the company had abided by the MoEFCC’s Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals (MSIHC) Rules, 1989. The second draft was ostensibly to shut the unit down in lieu of its violations and the damage it had caused. The Hindu could not access the full text of this draft but a note by Ms. Menon says: “The Company’s case is at present being considered by the Violation EAC in the ministry. In view of the magnitude of the accident and the clear responsibility of the company, directions to the company for closure under Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act is placed alongside for approval.” A decision on the matter was to be taken by the Secretary C.K. Mishra. He was due to retire on May 31 and left the decision to “his successor”, records of the meeting show. The matter then landed on the table of R.P. Gupta, the incumbent. However, on June 18, another officer of the Ministry noted that the matter was “discussed” with the Secretary (Mr. Gupta) and the final decision was to only seek a status report on the compliance with the MSIHC Rules. The reason proferred was that the APPCB had withdrawn the unit’s “consent to operate” and that the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which had imposed a Rs. 50 crore fine, was overseeing the process. “In view of the above, it is noted that the objectives desired through the set of proposed directions under Section 5 are already addressed by the actions initiated by APPCB and Hon’ble NGT. Therefore, Ministry may proceed only with the aspect of seeking status of compliance of MSIHC Rules,” according to the file-notings. “It’s clear that the Environment Ministry, even though it has the necessary powers, doesn’t want to involve itself in shutting down the company,” Mr. Tongad told The Hindu . On May 19, the MoEFCC-appointed ‘Violations Committee’ had deferred a decision on the company’s application on the grounds it would wait for final decisions by the NGT and other expert committees monitoring the aftermath of the industrial disaster.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/environment-ministry-dithered-on-decision-to-close-lg-plant/article32281243.ece

06 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Centre nod to CBI probe in Sushant case||The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on Wednesday issued a notification allowing the transfer of Sushant Singh Rajput death case to the CBI on a reference from the Bihar government. “The CBI has received the DoPT notification. Accordingly, the agency will take up the investigation,” said an agency official. The Bihar government had recommended the CBI probe amid allegations that a State police officer who had gone to Mumbai to supervise the investigation was deliberately quarantined there.  Rhea summoned by ED Bollywood actor Rhea Chakraborty, who is the main accused in the case alleging abetment to suicide, criminal conspiracy and cheating, has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate to record her statement in Mumbai on Friday. Her chartered accountant is expected to appear again before the probe team on Thursday. The ED on Wednesday recorded the statement of Samuel Miranda, the house manager for Sushant. It is alleged that Mr. Miranda was hired at the instance of Ms. Chakraborty. Earlier in the day, the Centre informed the Supre-me Court that it has agreed to accept the Bihar government’s recommendation for CBI probe. The Maharashtra government countered the Centre before a Single Bench of Justice Hrishikesh Roy, saying the case is being used to score political brownie points. Justice Roy told Maharashtra that quarantining the Bihar police team in Mumbai when all eyes are on the case “does not send a good message”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-nod-to-cbi-probe-in-sushant-case/article32281510.ece
06 August 2020||COIMBATORE,||‘Digital devices of Sri Lankan gangster missing’||The digital devices of the man suspected to be Sri Lankan underworld operative Angoda Lokka, who died early this July in Coimbatore, are missing, according to police. Before the CB-CID took over the investigation on Monday, Coimbatore city police had recovered the digital devices of Amani Thanji, the Sri Lankan woman who was staying with the suspect, and two others who allegedly helped them -- D. Sivakamasundari from Madurai and her friend S. Dyaneswaran from Erode. Police have strong reasons to believe that the suspect who lived as Pradeep Singh in Coimbatore could have used at least a mobile phone. However, no digital device was found from the rented house at Cheran Ma Nagar in Coimbatore during searches. “We were keen to investigate this aspect as digital devices used by a suspect will have large size of information. No such device was found until the CB-CID took over the investigation,” said a senior officer of the Coimbatore city police. Local police had seized a mobile phone from Thanji, two mobile phones and a tablet from Dyaneswaran and a mobile phone and laptop from Sivakamasundari.  Police suspect that the devices possibly used by the deceased could have be hidden somewhere or destroyed by the accused. The CB-CID is learnt to have examined the call data records of the three accused for possible leads in the investigation. The agency is now waiting to get the accused in custody for detailed interrogation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/digital-devices-of-sri-lankan-gangster-missing/article32281446.ece

Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam chaired a meeting with senior officials and representatives from various organisations in the Secretariat on Wednesday, and discussed various aspects of the celebrations. A senior officer told The Hindu , “All of them [representatives from various organisations] requested to allow the Vinayaka idol puja at least for a day with five persons, duly following social distancing norms.” While the discussion was over pujas and immersions, the procession aspect is almost ruled out this year. “They have all realised that procession is not possible but requested arrangements for immersion,” he said. A top official said, “We asked for their views. It will be discussed with the Chief Minister and decided. Mostly they all agreed to follow the government’s instructions.” Another officer said the meeting was only a preliminary one and there may be more meetings to finalise the decision. “No decision as such was taken,” he said.

06 August 2020||AYODHYA,||At ground zero, a spectrum of emotions||Iqbal Ansari, a litigant in the Ayodhya land dispute case, on Wednesday hoped the Ram temple construction would mark the end of any dispute. “I believe in the Constitution and the law. Muslims all over accepted the verdict. There is no more dispute,” he said. While he says he felt honoured being invited to attend the bhoomi pujan , Mr. Ansari is reluctant to offer a glorified picture of Ayodhya once the temple is built. When asked if the temple would accelerate development, he said: “Ayodhya has 10,000 temples, Sarayu river and Hanumanji’s mandir. Now another big temple will come up. It’s a good thing. What objection will Muslims have.” No celebrations here In contrast to the main road which was decorated with yellow paint on building facades, triangular saffron flags and floral designs, amid a commentary on the bhoomi pujan event played out through loudspeakers, Mr. Ansari’s locality in Ayodhya was quiet. Mumtaz Ali, who runs a furniture shop, was among those ambling out of a bylane. He had little to comment on the event. But when pushed, he said, “The final outcome is not just.” While he has reconciled with the decision, he says the issue triggers anything but calm. “Both mosque and temple should have been built, given the circumstances,” he said. However, Hindus in the town rejoiced over the event. Some distributed sweets to bystanders, while others shouted slogans. Many watched the event, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi’spujasand speech, on their televisions, cramped up inside homes or small shops. Many youngsters like Ram Avtar and Shiv Karan, both carpenters in their twenties, followed it on their smartphones. “The temple should be built swiftly. It is our prabhu Ram’s birthplace. So it is apt a temple is being built there,” said Mr. Avtar. The two men were not born when the Babri Masjid was demolished. They say they know nothing about it and see the temple construction as “restoration” of an earlier temple. Long wait for temple Ram Shankar Gupta, who sells puja items near the Hanumangarhi temple, said he had lost hope that a temple would be built in his lifetime. Mr. Gupta was born in 1951, two years after the idol of an infant Lord Ram was placed inside the mosque, changing the course of the dispute. “If the Lord keeps me alive, I will see it [Ram Temple] with these eyes,” said Mr. Gupta in tears. Ajay Kumar Tiwari, who is posted in the armed forces, arrived in Ayodhya on Tuesday during his leave for darshan of the temple. Before leaving for his home district Gonda, Mr. Tiwari was buying a saffron flag to fix onto his motorcycle. “It is a festival,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/at-ground-zero-a-spectrum-of-emotions/article32281269.ece
06 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||COVID-19 hits medical tech firms||The medical technology industry has suffered a 50-85% drop in revenue during April-June which saw a surge in COVID-19 pandemic across the world with suppliers to the cardiology, orthopaedic, ophthalmology and critical care sectors being the worst hit, noted an internal assessment by the Medical Technology Association of India (MTaI), representing leading research-based medical technology companies. Revenue loss It said the industry suffered an estimated revenue downfall in the cardiology category of up to 60% in the first quarter of the financial year, while the orthopaedic industry devices encountered an even bigger fall up to 85% and the ophthalmology sector 75%. Even the critical care device segment fell to nearly half. “Numerous financial and operational challenges in the wake of the pandemic has hit the industry hard,’’ it said. The Association said as India started recording surge in the infection, elective procedures were postponed. “Elective surgeries drive a large part of the demand for medical devices and the postponement has severely impacted the revenue streams of the medtech industry. The COVID-19 has accentuated the problems of the sector that was already reeling with the impact of price control. The pandemic disrupted the global supply chains, while the cost of freight movement increased by 5-7 folds. These challenges have been compounded by the falling rupee value, high basic customs duty rate and the health cess on imported medical devices which has been imposed since February 2020,’’ said Pavan Choudary, chairman MTaI. The sector is now seeking immediate intervention of the Central government to help them recover.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covid-19-hits-medical-tech-firms/article32281297.ece
06 August 2020||New Delhi,||Follow Lord Ram’s path during pandemic: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi used his speech at the temple town of Ayodhya on Wednesday to underscore the importance of following protocol in times of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quoting a Sanskrit verse from scriptures, Mr. Modi said, “Lord Ram’s direction is that elders, children and medical healers should always be protected. Corona has taught this very well to us.” The bhoomi pujan [ground breaking] ceremony for a grand Ram temple at Ayodhya saw a limited number of invitees because of the COVID-19 pandemic and was restricted to 175 official guests. According to the Prime Minister, Lord Ram speaks and acts according to the place, time and circumstances and teaches one how to move with time. “It is even more essential to follow Lord Ram’s path in times of corona and the situation one is in. Currently, the need is to have ‘ do gaz ki doori, mask hain zaroori ’ [maintain six feet physical distance and a face mask is essential],” said Mr. Modi. Earlier, soon after landing at a makeshift helipad at Ayodhya, Mr. Modi was seen wearing his face mask as he came out of a special helicopter of the Indian Air Force. Dignitaries who were waiting to receive the Prime Minister, including Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Governor Anandiben Patel were waiting in designated circles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/follow-lord-rams-path-during-pandemic-modi/article32281262.ece

06 August 2020||Guwahati,||Brus reject resettlement site offer||Three organisations representing the Bru community displaced from Mizoram have rejected the sites proposed by the Joint Movement Committee (JMC), an umbrella group of non-Brus in Tripura, for their resettlement. The Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples’ Forum, Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples’ Coordination Committee and Bru Displaced Welfare Committee have also trashed the demand for inclusion of four JMC members in the monitoring team for the resettlement of the Brus. The JMC comprising the Bengali, Mizo, Buddhist Barua and other communities had on July 21 submitted a memorandum to the Tripura government specifying six places in Kanchanpur and Panisagar subdivisions of North Tripura district for the resettlement of the Brus who fled ethnic violence in Mizoram since 1997. The JMC also proposed settling 500 families at most in these places. “The interference of the Kanchanpur Nagarik Suraksha Mancha and Mizo Convention [prime constituents of JMC] in site selection is completely unjustified as they are not a part of either the quadrilateral agreement or signatory,” the three Bru organisations said in a letter to North Tripura district’s Superintendent of Police on August 3. “Inclusion of four JMC members in the monitoring team for the settlement of Bru internally-displaced people is also not applicable since they are not having no connection or involvement in the issue of either repatriation to Mizoram or resettlement in Tripura during the last 23 years,” the Bru organisations said. The three refugee groups insisted on resettling some 6,500 families in clusters of at least 500 families at each of the sites of their choice — seven in North Tripura district and five in the adjoining Dhalai district. The sites proposed by the JMC, they said, are unconnected by road and electricity and too far from hospitals, schools and other facilities. The Bru groups also demanded the arrest of the JMC leaders for “abusive, derogatory and inflammatory statements” against the Bru community. The JMC leaders denied any slanderous statements against the Brus and said their choice of sites for the resettlement of the refugees from Mizoram would be a win-win situation for both groups.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/brus-reject-resettlement-site-offer/article32281291.ece
06 August 2020||Ayodhya,||RSS chief hails role of Advani, Singhal||The ground-breaking ceremony for the Ram temple in Ayodhya has spread joy across the country and will provide the self confidence needed for making India self-reliant, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said on Wednesday. Recalling the three-decade-long struggle of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its ideological family members for the temple, Mr. Bhagwat hailed the contributions of veteran BJP leader L.K. Advani, the late VHP president Ashok Singhal and Mahant Ramchandra Das Paramhans. There were many people who worked hard and some even sacrificed their lives for the temple and many might not be here physically, he said, remembering Singhal and the spiritual face of the temple movement, the late Paramhans. “While there are some like Advaniji who led therath yatrabut could not come due to the current situation [COVID-19 pandemic], he must be watching this from his home on TV,” he said. Mr. Bhagwat, who was the guest of honour for the ceremony, said, “there is a wave of happiness in the country.” “There is a pleasure of fulfilment of a dream for years. But the greatest joy is that establishment of the self-confidence and self-sufficiency needed for making India self-reliant is realised today,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rss-chief-hails-role-of-advani-singhal/article32281256.ece
06 August 2020||New Delhi,||President, Venkaiah lay stress on unity||The foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Ram temple in Ayodhya defines India’s spirit of social harmony and people’s zeal, President Ram Nath Kovind said on Wednesday. “Felicitations to all for the foundation laying of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Being built in tune with law, it defines India’s spirit of social harmony and people’s zeal. It will be a testimony to ideals of Ram Rajya and a symbol of modern India,” President Kovind tweeted. Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu said the construction of the temple was much more than a religious affair and the structure would stand as a tribute to the best of timeless human values. Lord Ram’s conduct and values constitute the core of the consciousness of India, cutting across all kinds of divisions and barriers, and they are still relevant today, he tweeted. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla expressed hope that the temple construction will lead to unity and harmony. “It is a matter of great pleasure that the construction of the temple will be achieved with the support of people of all religions and classes,” Mr. Birla said in a statement. Home Minister Amit Shah, who is in hospital after testing positive for COVID-19, called the event “historic”. In a series of tweets, he asserted that temple construction is now a reality because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “strong and decisive leadership”. ‘Historic day’ “Today is a historic and proud day for India. The consecration of the grand Ram temple by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Lord Ram’s birthplace has written a golden chapter in the history of the great Indian culture and civilisation and heralded the beginning of a new era,” he said. “The construction of the grand Ram temple demonstrates the strong and decisive leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. My heartiest congratulations to all Indians on this unforgettable day. The Modi government will always remain committed to the preservation of Indian culture and its values.” BJP president J.P. Nadda complimented the citizens for accepting the Supreme Court verdict. “After a long struggle of 500 years, the Supreme Court paved the way for the construction of the temple and it is a matter of pride that all sections of society happily accepted this decision. The entire country set a unique example by following the ideals of Lord Ram,” Mr. Nadda said. Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who had once represented the deity in court as a lawyer, tweeted: “The grand Ram temple is also the temple of the country. It is also a celebration of India’s pride, self respect and our spiritual inheritance.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/president-venkaiah-lay-stress-on-unity/article32281264.ece
06 August 2020||New Delhi,||Congress walks a tightrope on temple||Moments after Prime Minister Narendra Modi completed the bhoomi pujan in Ayodhya on Wednesday, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi tweeted about Lord Ram embodying the finest human values, and who would never stand with “hate, cruelty and injustice”. But unlike his sister and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Mr. Gandhi, who is a Lok Sabha member from Wayanad in Kerala, did not refer to the bhoomi pujan.  The tweet reflected a tricky path some in the Congress are walking on temple politics. In Kerala, where the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) is an ally of the Congress, the party wants to make a distinction between an inclusive Hindu philosophy and the strident Hindutva identified with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). But in North India, most leaders have openly and visibly embraced the temple construction event and it is being seen more as a matter of “course correction”. Following the 2014 poll debacle, when the Congress was reduced to 44 seats, senior leader A. K. Antony had submitted an internal report where he is learnt to have talked about a “public perception” in which Congress was seen as a party for minorities. The party never made the report public but its impact was clearly seen in how the party handled Assembly election campaigns. On Tuesday, former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister, Kamal Nath, held a Hanuman Chalisa recitation and announced that the Congress would offer 11 silver bricks for the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya.  Some Congress leaders like Shashi Tharoor and Salman Khurshid, however, did make a fine point with their tweets. Referring to the court order on the temple-mosque dispute, Mr. Khurshid tweeted, “The temple is welcome but one should remember the court also ordered the mosque to be built. The Prime Minister should support both as it is the heritage of secularism. Faith in religion and faith in the Constitution.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-walks-a-tightrope-on-temple/article32281266.ece
06 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Amnesty urges NHRC, NCW to open J&K offices||An Amnesty International India report on Wednesday urged the National Human Rights Commission and the National Commission for Women to set up offices in Jammu and Kashmir, saying the people there had not had any redressal of their rights violations after the closure of the State Commissions a year ago. Marking the first anniversary of the revocation of J&K’s special status under Article 370 and splitting the State into two Union Territories on August 5, 2019, the organisation also called on the government to release all political leaders, journalists and activists from detention; restore 4G mobile Internet; de-congest prisons and start an independent investigation into attacks on journalists. Panels wrapped up In a report on the situation a year after Article 370 was read down, Amnesty noted that seven State-level Commissions, including the human rights panel, had been wrapped up. “Given the chronic history of human rights abuses in the past in the region, Amnesty International India recommends that the NHRC set up a branch office for Jammu and Kashmir to facilitate easy access to the complaint filing process for the local people,” the report said. Amnesty also asked the NHRC to appoint a special monitor for the region and to take up cases pending with the erstwhile State Commission. It also recommended that the NCW set up a J&K cell for addressing problems faced by women. In a statement, Amnesty International India executive director Avinash Kumar said: “Over the last one year, the Government of India has been systematically dismantling all avenues for justice for the people of Jammu and Kashmir. With zero representation, protracted Internet restrictions, arbitrary use of some of India’s most stringent laws, verbal orders of detention and crippling of the local media — most of this disproportionately higher in Kashmir — it’s been a complete year since we have heard the people of Jammu and Kashmir speak.” It said while it acknowledged that there may be security concerns that merit restrictions on the right to freedom of expression, the curbs should be for a limited timeframe and as per the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights “to which India is a state party”.“However, in an absolute violation of India’s international obligations, the entire population of Kashmir has been deprived of their right to freedom of expression and opinion through protracted communication restrictions since the last one year. This has been compounded by a censored media, continuing detention of political leaders, arbitrary restrictions due to the pandemic with little to no redressal,” the Amnesty statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amnesty-urges-nhrc-ncw-to-open-jk-offices/article32281299.ece
06 August 2020||MALAPPURAM,||IUML treads cautiously on Ayodhya||The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) has responded cautiously to Congress leaders’ stand on the beginning of Ram Temple construction at the disputed site at Ayodhya. Even when expressing disagreement with Congress general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s statement welcoming the Ram Temple construction, the IUML has said it does not want to raise a discussion on the matter. Disagreement A national leadership meeting of the party anchored from Panakkad, near here, on Wednesday adopted a resolution terming Ms. Vadra’s statement out of place. “We express our disagreement on the statement issued by Priyanka Gandhi on the construction of a temple at Ayodhya and her statement is very much out of place,” said the one-sentence resolution. However, the party leadership decided not to create an issue out of it considering the sensitivity of the matter. “Babri Masjid dispute was closed with the judgment by the Supreme Court. We don’t want to open any further discussion on it because it will not be good for the country,” IUML organising secretary E.T Mohammed Basheer, MP, told The Hindu. The party leadership shared the opinion that the “constructive stand” it took in the wake of the demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992 had immensely benefited Kerala society. “Many had tried to provoke us in the wake of the razing of the Babri Masjid. But we stood by our constructive and responsible stand. And time proved that the party stance benefited our society,” said Mr. Basheer.

They told IUML leaders that Ms. Gandhi’s had merely articulated the position adopted by the Congress after the Supreme Court settled the Babri Masjib dispute. However, the IUML reportedly told Congress leaders that several influential Muslim organisations and scholars had viewed Ms Gandhi’s statement as supportive of the stance of the BJP.

06 August 2020||Mumbai,||Rs. 42 lakh loss as some trains ran empty: Maharashtra||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday told the Bombay High Court that it incurred a loss of nearly Rs. 42 lakh due to the under utilisation of Shramik Special trains which were arranged to ferry migrant workers to their respective States following the lockdown induced by COVID-19. Advocate General (AG) Ashutosh Kumbhakoni told a Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice A.S. Gadkari that this loss was because not enough workers availed the trains to return home. He said in fact now workers want to either stay in Maharashtra or return. Last month, the State government arranged trains to ferry thousands of migrant workers, but only 3,551 people used the trains, he added. Mr. Kumbhakoni said a train was arranged from Pune to ferry 383 people to their native State, but on the day of the departure, only 49 people boarded the 24-coach train. The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) and raised issues related to migrant workers stranded due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Advocate Ronita Bhattacharya Bector, representing CITU, told the court that there were several migrant workers waiting to return to their homes in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. The Bench directed the AG to file an affidavit on the number of trains run and expenditure incurred by the State. It also directed the petitioner to file a rejoinder on how many workers were waiting to go back and to which State. In the previous hearing, Ms. Bector had told the court that in June there were 52,000 migrant workers in the State, 30,000 of whom were ready to return to their native places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rs-42-lakh-loss-as-some-trains-ran-empty-maharashtra/article32281303.ece
06 August 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Cong. paved way for Ram temple: Pinarayi||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday said the Congress had paved the way for the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya by forsaking the cardinal principle of secularism enshrined in the Constitution. The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) had played second fiddle to the Congress leadership. Mr. Vijayan veered away from the pandemic situation at his daily press conference to blame the Congress for the rise of right-wing majoritarian forces and Hindu identity politics in the country. He said he was not surprised that Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had welcomed the laying of the foundation stone for the temple. She had merely espoused the soft Hindutva line of the Congress. Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders had echoed the true sentiments of the Congress. “Are you surprised? I am not,” he told journalists. (Madhya Pradesh Congress president and former Chief Minister Kamal Nath had offered puja to a Ram idol in the run-up to the ceremony). The CM said the Congress had brought the current “predicament” upon the country and itself by unabashedly towing a political line that brazenly appeased Hindu right-wing forces. The Rajiv Gandhi government had opened the disputed site for Ram worship. The Congress in power at the Centre allowed ‘shilanyas’ at the contested spot later. Violation of law The Narasimha Rao government had turned a blind eye when Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) karsevaks stormed the Babri Masjid. The Congress leadership remained unmoved when the RSS demolished the structure in wanton violation of the law. The Congress had scorned secular forces, which warned it repeatedly against succouring forces that embraced the politics of division, by stoking sectarian sentiments in the traditionally plural and culturally heterogeneous society. Now the party was paying the price for its follies, he said. An editorial in the IUML newspaper Chandrika on Wednesday reminded the Congress that secular forces should prevent the BJP from using the might of governance to construct the temple. “Do not reopen the wounds of Babri Masjid,” the opinion piece read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-paved-way-for-ram-temple-pinarayi/article32281649.ece

Abdul Rahim and Kemal Pasha, have lashed out at reports linking their names to the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case. Mr. Rahim, who according to some media reports was under the observation of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), said he decided to take a legal recourse against the vilification campaign. “It must be my nomination as head of the Kerala Administrative Tribunal that might have triggered the smear campaign. The Kerala government has nothing to do with the nomination as it has been cleared by the Chief Justice of the Kerala High Court after considering eligibility criteria. It is the discretion of the Kerala Governor and not the State government to forward the name to the Centre for appointment,” Mr. Rahim said. On the reported instruction of NIA that he shall not leave the town, Mr. Rahim said he was not under the observation of any agency. “On the day in which the news appeared, I was at Thrissur on an official assignment. I don't have any relatives in Chennai or Kolkata as alleged in some reports,” he said. Mr. Rahim said some sections of society, who wanted the religious minorities to be kept away from the mainstay of the society, were behind the campaign. At the same time, Mr. Pasha said his name too was dragged in.  A sound clip of Mr. Pasha explaining that it was Mr. Rahim’s name that was being discussed in connection with the case deepened the controversy. Mr. Pasha, while conceding that it was his voice, clarified that the audio clip was part of a personal conversation, which was leaked out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/smuggling-case-ex-hc-judges-lash-out-at-moves-to-link-them/article32281652.ece
06 August 2020||HYDERABAD,||Ten lakh home isolation kits to be kept ready in Telangana||The Cabinet at its meeting on Wednesday decided to supply kits to enable home isolation as soon as people tested positive for corona virus. It was decided to keep in readiness 10 lakh kits, a release said. The Cabinet also decided to empower Collectors to appoint health staff on temporary basis if there was shortage in government hospitals. As many as 10,000 beds equipped with oxygen will be kept ready in hospitals to meet the virus spread. The government will act tough on hospitals which resorted to irregularities in treatment of COVID 19 patients. In addition to Rs. 100 crore already released to meet COVID expenditure, the Cabinet sanctioned a further Rs. 100 crore for the purpose. The fund will be released by Health department on a monthly basis. The government will bear the expenditure on drugs, injections and food at private medical colleges which extended free service to virus patients. More tests Mr. Rao asked the health authorities to ramp up corona tests to 40,000 a day. Lakhs of drugs, injections and personal protection equipment should be kept at the disposal of hospitals. The discussion on corona, lasting nearly two-and-a-half hours, noted that the virus was on the decline in major cities across the world. The same was the situation in Hyderabad. The mortality rate was low and recovery high in Telangana. Therefore, there was no need for panic, the Cabinet appealed to public. People need not rush to private hospitals for treatment as it was available in ample measure in governement hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ten-lakh-home-isolation-kits-to-be-kept-ready-in-telangana/article32281594.ece
06 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||It is criticism, not contempt: Bhushan||Noted civil rights lawyer Prashant Bhushan maintained in the Supreme Court that his tweets in June of a photograph showing Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde astride a motorbike and the court’s role in the past six years amounted to “criticism” and not contempt. “This is criticism... Why don’t you take it objectively?” senior advocate Dushyant Dave, for Mr. Bhushan, asked a three-judge Bench, led by Justice Arun Mishra, on Wednesday. Mr. Dave said a sitting judge, who went on to become a CJI, had “criticised” the functioning of the Supreme Court in a press meetin January 2018. Justice Ranjan Gogoi, one of the four judges who had met the media, went on to become the 46th Chief Justice and was Justice Bobde’s immediate predecessor. Justice Mishra asked whether Mr. Dave was justifying the press conference or what was said in it. “The holding of January 2018 press conference was fully justified. If the then CJI was not listening to their points, what could they do? If citizens stand up and criticise the system, say everything is not hunky-dory, how can it be contempt?” the senior lawyer asked. He said hundreds of people had tweeted the photograph of Chief Justice Bobde on the motorbike. “There are many amusing tweets by others... Is the court going to call them all in?” Mr. Dave asked. ‘Driven by anguish’ He said Mr. Bhushan’s tweets were driven by anguish. He referred to how some sections of the media generated hate against the members of the Tablighi Jamaat who got sick. He submitted that some recent cases required a timely healing touch from the Supreme Court. “You are both mother and father to a 100 crore people! You are their parents... You alone can do something for the people,” Mr. Dave submitted in court. He referred to the judgments in the Rafale and Ayodhya title dispute cases. He recalled how a Supreme Court judge had sat in his own cause on a Saturday. He wondered when the Justice A.K. Patnaik report on the “larger conspiracy” against judiciary would come out. “These are serious issues striking at the core of the judiciary. Anyone would be anguished,” Mr. Dave said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/it-is-criticism-not-contempt-bhushan/article32281282.ece

The department under the ‘Humara Ghar, Humara Vidyalaya’ programme planned to reach 22 lakh students from classes 9 to 12, but just around 6,60,000 — 20% through TV and 10% through WhatsApp — were reached from July 18, when the programme began, to July 25. Families of 30% of the students don’t possess TVs or smartphones having Internet connection to avail of the study material, said Kamna Acharya, Additional Director, Directorate of Public Instruction. “The remaining students didn’t avail themselves of modules regularly,” she said. “When smartphones with internet connections are there, parents often take them to work. It is a huge challenge to continue the regular curriculum,” added Ms. Acharya. Reaching to students in the 89 tribal dominated blocks in districts such as Alirajpur, Barwani and Jhabua was a task. After teachers’ workshop, said an order issued by the Directorate’s Commissioner Jayshree Kiyawat on July 13, students had to be divided into various groups. The one having mobile phones, wherein if a family has one phone it could be used by all its children. Those having TV, who must watch the telecast during fixed time slots on Doordarshan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mps-online-classes-not-reaching-majority-of-students/article32281300.ece
06 August 2020||HYDERABAD,||Telangana moves SC to stop A.P.’s RLIP tender process||The Telangana government has moved the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Andhra Pradesh government to stop the process of tenders for Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Project (RLIP), one of the two components to divert about 8 tmc ft Krishna water a day from Srisailam reservoir, in violation of the riparian rights of Telangana. Officials of the Irrigation Department stated on Wednesday that a Special Leave Petition (SLP) was filed through the e-filing system on the issue by a team of counsel on behalf of the Telangana government. They said that it was expected to be listed and come up for hearing in a couple of days. The SLP has been filed as decided at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on July 30 to discuss the situation arising out of AP’s water diversion plans and Krishna River Management Board’s (KRMB) directions to AP to stop the process of tenders of RLIP. It was decided at the meeting that the government would continue its “relentless fight, including legal recourse, to stop the project under any circumstances”. The Telangana government has brought to the Supreme Court’s notice that the AP government had set in motion its Krishna water diversion plans without seeking any approval from the KRMB and the Apex Council, as provisioned for under the AP Reorganisation Act in the matter of utilising river water by Telangana and AP, or getting the nod from the Central Water Commission to begin with. The AP government had issued a GO 203 on May 5 this year specifying its plans to take up RLIP and to expand Pothireddypadu to increase its water drawal capacity to 80,000 cusecs. Further, Telangana has pointed out that the two plans of AP would enable it to draw over 8 tmc ft of Krishna water every day. “As it is the Pothireddypaddu head regulator system has the capacity to draw over 5 tmc ft of water every day and it is proved during the flood season last year. Practically, the water drawal capacity of Pothireddypadu is 60,150 cusecs although it is 44,000 cusecs officially,” a senior Irrigation official of Telangana told The Hindu . The water drawal capacity of Pothireddypadu was increased to 44,000 cusecs in 2007 from the previous 11,150 cusecs undermining the riparian rights of Telangana during united AP itself. AP’s plans are in gross violation of the existing tribunal award, according to which, the State has already utilised its entire quota of allocation by tying it up with various irrigation systems, Telangana said in its petition. It has requested the SC to stop the RLIP tender process as also implementation of GO 203 as they amounted to violation of provisions of AP Reorganisation Act, besides the existing tribunal award and riparian rights of Telangana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ts-moves-supreme-court-to-stop-aps-rlip-tender-process/article32281353.ece
06 August 2020||HYDERABAD,||‘A.P. plan detrimental for riparian states like TS’||The Telangana government has explained in its Special Leave Petition (SLP) filed in the Supreme Court that Krishna water diversion from Srisailam reservoir, a common water storage facility for the two Telugu states after bifurcation of united AP, as being planned by the AP government would allow it to take away over 11.3 tmc ft of water out of the basin. Both the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Project (RLIP) and expansion of Pothireddypadu head regulator (PHR) to increase the water drawal capacity would be detrimental to the interest of the riparian states, particularly Telangana, since both the dependable and surplus water in Krishna has already been tied up by the State for its ongoing project, which also enable taking Krishna water to Penna basin. Telangana has brought to the notice of the SC that no riparian State has been utilising the additional quantity of water apportioned by the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT)-II or the Brijesh Kumar Tribunal following an interim order passed by the apex court. “The AP government cannot conduct its affairs to the detriment of the riparian states,” the Telangana government submitted to the court in its petition. It has also drawn the court’s attention to the fact that the Pothireddypadu head regulator, the source contemplated to divert drinking water to Chennai, was to be confined to diversion capacity of 1,500 cusecs with lined canal, was built to draw 11,150 cusecs with unlined canal to allow drawal of water anywhere in between in violation of the inter-state agreement. Violation The violation was also contested by the upper riparian states of Karnataka and Maharashtra before the KWDT-II. “While the legality of enhancing the diversion capacity to 11,150 cusecs was being adjudicated before KWDT-II, the erstwhile AP had created an additional diversion capacity at PHR by creating new vents with a capacity of 44,000 cusecs and a power channel of 5,000 cusecs, taking the total diversion capacity outside the basin to 60,150 cusecs,” Telangana pointed out in the petition. The AP government’s unilateral decision in violation of AP Reorganisation Act, KWDT-I and KWDT-II, to construct the RLIP with a capacity to draw 3 tmc ft water a day from the bottom of the reservoir at 797 ft water level against the full reservoir level of 885 ft and further increase in the drawal capacity of PHR to 80,000 cusecs (from 841 ft level) would allow it to divert huge quantity of water (3 tmc ft from the RLIP and 8.31 tmc ft from PHR per day). “This project (RLIP and PHR expansion) will have an adverse impact on the in-basin utilisation in Telangana depriving water to the projects already in operation and would cause prejudice to it under Section 89 of the AP Reorganisation Act,” Telangana said in the SLP and requested the Supreme Court to restrain AP from taking any action under GO 203 (RLIP) and GO 388 (PHR expansion).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ap-plan-detrimental-to-riparian-states-like-ts/article32281626.ece
06 August 2020||HYDERABAD,||Krishna river board approves fresh water indents||The Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) has approved fresh indents for water utilisation by Telangana and Andhra Pradesh till the end of August. A total of 54.67 tmc ft water has been approved to be utilised till the month-end. However, it includes the quantity of water already availed (drawn) by the two States from the two common sources – Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar reservoirs – from June 1 this year. Member Secretary of the river board Harikesh Meena issued the water release order on Wednesday after his telephonic discussions with the Engineers-in-Chief (ENCs) of the two States on August 4 and also considering the request letters of AP written to the board on July 20 and 23 and of Telangana written on July 30 to meet the drinking water and irrigation needs. The river board has assessed the availability of water above the minimum draw down level (MDDL) in the two common reservoirs as on August 3 as 110.44 tmc ft., including 29.68 tmc ft. in Srisailam and 80.76 tmc ft. in Nagarjunasagar. As per the fresh approval of the indents, Telangana is entitled to draw 7.746 tmc from Srisailam for Kalwakurthy lift and 22.19 tmc ft for Left Canal and Alimineti Madhava Reddy Project and 7.74 tmc ft for Mission Bhagiratha and Hyderabad city from Nagarjunasagar. Similarly, AP is entitled to draw 9 tmc ft for Pothireddypadu and Chennai drinking water and 8 tmc ft for Handri-Neeva lift from Srisailam. The quantities approved for the two States include the water already availed from June 1. The ENC of AP did not agree for the request of Telangana ENC to consider the savings and carry over storages in the water share allocated to it in the previous (2019-20) water year while approving the fresh indents stating that any of the two States can not carry forward its savings and un-utilised share of water allocated in the previous year. The Member Secretary suggested the two ENCs to take up discussion on the issue at a separate meeting or in the three-member committee meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/krishna-river-board-approves-fresh-water-indents/article32281635.ece
06 August 2020||Bengaluru,||EIA: Centre restrained from publishing final notification||The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday restrained the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change from publishing the final notification based on the draft notification of the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA)-2020 till the next date of hearing on a PIL petition. The court, however, clarified that the Ministry can take all further steps based on the draft EIA-2020 except issuing final notification, and the Ministry could move the court for vacating the order against publishing the final notification if reasonable time to file objections and suggestions were provided after publicising draft EIA-2020 in Kannada language. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the interim order on the petition filed by United Conservation Movement Charitable and Welfare Trust, Bengaluru, seeking a stay on the draft EIA-2020 complaining that notification was not published in Kannada language. The draft EIA-2020, dated March 23, 2020, gave 60 days as per the law for public and other stakeholders to submit objections and suggestions. Later, taking note of COVID-19 lockdown, the last date to respond was initially extended till June 30, and again extended till August 11. The Bench, however, noted that Ministry’s counsel could not give a positive assurance on behalf of the Ministry that a reasonable time would be given to submit objections and suggestions after publicising the notification in Kannada. The Bench noted that many people, not knowing English and Hindi languages, could not have responded in view of the lockdown and non-availability of notification in Kannada. Earlier, the Ministry’s counsel said that a proposal to extend the August 11 deadline to submit objections and suggestions is being considered and a decision is expected shortly and clarified that the Ministry was committed to giving wide publicity for the draft EIA-2020. It was also contended on behalf of the Ministry that the draft notification was required to be published in the official gazette only in English and Hindi languages, and the Ministry had already directed all the State Environment Impact Assessment Authorities to publicise the draft EIA-2020 in local languages, including in Kannada, which could not be done so far owing to constraints of COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/eia-centre-restrained-from-publishing-final-notification/article32281234.ece

A team of plainclothes officers dramatically arrested the suspect, M.R. Bijulal, senior accountant, government sub-treasury, Vanchiyoor, when he was interacting with television channel reporters at the office of his lawyer Poonthura Soman. The officers in mufti entered the office, detained Bijulal and hustled him away to the nearby police station in an unmarked van at 11.20 a.m.  Mr. Bijulal had protested his innocence earlier and claimed that some persons had framed him. He had also moved the District Court here for anticipatory bail. The police had been on the stakeout near Mr. Soman’s office anticipating Bijulal’s arrival. Mr. Soman later said the police had infringed on lawyer-client privilege. The prosecution case was that Bijulal had logged into the treasury online banking network using his user name and password and electronically moved Rs. 2 crore from the Tribal Welfare Fund account operated by the District Collector to the treasury account he held in his name. Financial transactions The police were verifying Bijulal’s financial transactions. An officer said the suspect appeared to have won large amounts of money playing online card games. They have booked him on the charge of conspiracy, cheating, impersonation and theft. The government might also order a Vigilance inquiry against the official on suspicion of having defrauded the exchequer and amassed wealth illegally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/police-arrest-treasury-scam-accused-from-lawyers-office/article32281241.ece
06 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||EWS quota challenge referred to Constitution Bench||The Supreme Court on Wednesday referred to a five-judge Bench the “substantial question of law” whether grant of 10% reservation to economically weaker sections of the society is unconstitutional and violates the 50% ceiling cap on quota declared by the court itself. A three-judge Bench, led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde, said the primary question for the Constitution Bench to decide is whether “economic backwardness” can be the sole criterion for granting quota in government jobs and educational institutions for those who would otherwise have to compete in the general category. The three-judge Bench had refused to stay the implementation of the Constitution (103rd Amendment) Act, which provides the 10% quota, when it had reserved for orders a year ago. Several petitions led by Janhit Abhiyan had challenged the validity of the Constitutional Amendment, saying the 50% quota limit was part of the Basic Structure of the Constitution. The Kerala Munnoka Samudaya Aikya Munnani, the latter represented by advocate V.K. Biju, had supported the quota law. The economic reservation was introduced in the Constitution by amending Articles 15 and 16 and adding clauses empowering the State governments to provide reservation on the basis of economic backwardness “It is the case of the petitioners that the very amendments run contrary to the Constitutional scheme, and no segment of available seats/posts can be reserved only on the basis of economic criterion. As such, we are of the view that such questions do constitute substantial questions of law to be considered by a Bench of five judges,” the judgment said. The Centre had argued that it was every State’s prerogative to provide 10% economic reservation in State government jobs and admissions in State-run education institutions. “Whether or not to provide reservation to the economically weaker section (EWS) of the society for appointment in State government jobs and for admission to State government educational institutions, as per provisions of the newly inserted Articles 15(6) and 16(6) of the Constitution, is to be decided by the State government concerned,” a seven-page affidavit filed by the Central government had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ews-quota-challenge-referred-to-constitution-bench/article32281280.ece
06 August 2020||CHANDIGARH,||‘M.P. should not get GI tag for basmati rice’||Amid Madhya Pradesh government’s push for the Geographical Indication (GI) tag for basmati rice, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his personal intervention against allowing this in the larger interest of Punjab and other States which are already basmati GI tagged. Apart from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Western Uttar Pradesh and select districts of Jammu and Kashmir have GI tagging for basmati. The Chief Minister said India exported basmati to the tune of Rs. 33,000 crore every year. Any dilution in registration may give advantage to Pakistan (which also produces basmati as per GI tagging) in the international market in terms of basmati characteristics, quality parameters. The Chief Minister, in his letter, has said GI tagging of Madhya Pradesh basmati would negatively impact the State’s agriculture and India’s basmati exports. Madhya Pradesh has sought inclusion of its 13 districts for GI tagging for basmati. Urging Mr. Modi to direct the authorities not to disturb the status quo in this matter, the Chief Minister said this was essential for safeguarding the interests of farmers and basmati exporters of India. Place of origin “As per the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999 a geographical indication tag can be issued for agricultural goods that are originating in the territory of a country, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristics of such goods is essentially attributable to its geographical origin. GI tag for basmati has been given on the basis of the traditionally grown areas of basmati due to special aroma, quality and taste of the grain, which is indigenous to the region below the foothills of Himalayas in the Indo-Gangetic Plains and basmati of this area has distinct recognition across the world,” the Chief Minister has pointed out. Capt. Singh said Madhya Pradesh did not fall under the specialised zone for basmati cultivation. “It was for this reason that the State was not included in the indigenous area of basmati cultivation in India.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mp-should-not-get-gi-tag-for-basmati-rice/article32281293.ece

06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Modern symbol of Indian Culture: Modi||The formal start of the temple’s construction comes almost 28 years after Babri Masjid was demolished by a mob of ‘kar sevaks’ on December 6, 1992. Following a protracted legal dispute and aggressive Hindutva politics over it in the last three decades, the Supreme Court last November permitted the construction of a Ram temple at the site, where the Mughal-era mosque stood for four centuries and where Hindus believe Lord Ram was born. The Ram temple has long been a poll promise of the BJP which claimed power in Uttar Pradesh and at the Centre following the temple agitation since mid-1980s. “With this temple, not only is new history being scripted, history is repeating itself,” Mr. Modi said. Mr. Modi, who visited Ayodhya town for the first time since becoming Prime Minister, started his speech with the chants of ‘Jai Siyaram’ and ‘Siyavar Ram Chandra ki Jai’, in sync with the local tradition and departure from the ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans popularised by advocates of the Ram temple movement, including the Vishwa Hindu Parishad since the 1990s. Just like August 15 was commemorated as the day of sacrifice and the will to be free displayed by many generations of Indians during the Independence struggle, the start of the Ram temple construction on August 5, 2020 was a “symbol of penance, sacrifice and resolve” of many generations that struggled for it for centuries, he said. Mr. Modi said Lord Ram was “embedded in our hearts” despite attempts to wipe out his legacy. “Buildings were destroyed. What not happened. All attempts were made to wipe out the existence. But Ram is still in our hearts. Ram is the basis of our culture,” the Prime Minister said. After landing in Ayodhya, Mr. Modi first offered prayers at the Hanumangarhi temple before paying his obeisance and offering aarti before the idol of Ram Lalla at the Ram Janmabhoomi site, the first Prime Minister to do so. He also planted a ‘Parijat’ tree at the site and released a postage stamp on the temple. “This day is testimony to the truth of the crores of Ram bhakts,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modern-symbol-of-indian-culture-modi/article32281249.ece

When Mr. Mulakkal’s lawyer and senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi persisted with the plea, Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde drily asked, “Are you exercising your spiritual power over us?” “There is no case of discharge in your favour. We have seen your case. We are dismissing your case,” Chief Justice Bobde said. The Bench listened to Mr. Rohatgi make a few more submissions before the CJI again intervened, this time with a finality to say, “Mr. Rohatgi, the one minute you asked for (to make submissions) is long over.” Mr. Mulakkal had approached the top court shortly after a local court in Kerala cancelled his bail. Both the trial court and the Kerala High Court had refused to quash the rape case against the former bishop.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-refuses-to-quash-case-against-franco-mulakkal/article32281245.ece

The ED is probing the money laundering angle to the case, whereas the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has been pursuing the criminal aspect of the conspiracy to smuggle gold into the country from the UAE in large quantities. It is suspected that the syndicate had smuggled in about 250 kg of gold since July 2019. The alleged kingpin has been identified by the NIA as K.T. Ramees, who was first arrested by the Customs Department. The scam came to light on July 5 when 30 kg of gold was seized at the airport in Thiruvananthapuram. Accused Sarith P.S. and Ms. Suresh were former employees in the consulate.

06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Symbolic quest||Beyond the narratives in the Bhagavata Purana, there are many useful pointers for those keen on spiritual quest. First of all, these instil bhakti as most of them talk of the lives of devoted saints, rishis, and people who seek God through devotion. There are also many echoes of the Upanishad teachings that reiterate the importance of realising the Supreme Brahman in one’s own inner self. For instance, the section that deals with the way in which Brahma tries to understand his own self and presence when he finds himself on the lotus bud is symbolic of the quest for realisation, pointed out Sri R. Krishnamurthy Sastrigal in a discourse. It is said that at the time when Srishti takes place according to the Lord’s Divine Will, Brahma is the first created being. He is called the Swayambu, the self-born, who is the embodiment of the Vedas. When he appears in the lotus bud that emerges from the Lord’s navel, the Lord Himself enters the lotus. But then Brahma is unable to understand who he is. He enters the hollow of the lotus stalk and it seems to have no end at all. He comes back to the lotus and begins to meditate for a hundred years. After such arduous meditation, the truth of the Lord, who is the indwelling spirit of all, dawns on him. This only shows that no amount of looking for the truth in the external world can have any bearing. The analogy of the two birds living together in a tree quoted in the Upanishads also teaches the important truth that the Lord is the abiding spirit and soul in each and every aspect of creation. He dwells in each being as a witness of all what each one does. It is for us to understand His presence and seek His grace instead of chasing the attractions of the world.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/symbolic-quest/article32281275.ece

06 August 2020||GUWAHATI,||Protests in Assam over ‘lack of care’||The Congress and local organisations have been protesting the deaths of COVID-19 positive and negative patients due to alleged non-treatment in eastern Assam’s Jorhat. The protests peaked on Tuesday when the State recorded 2,886 cases of infection, the most in a day. Former Congress MLA Rana Goswami led a team that protested at the Jorhat Medical College and Hospital (JMCH) for alleged mismanagement of the medical system. Organisations such as the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chhatra Parishad had staged protests against the “medical negligence in the name of COVID-19” earlier. “At least four persons who were taken to the JMCH in serious condition died because doctors reportedly did not attend to them in time. They waited two-three days for COVID-19 test results to come by which time the patients have expired,” said Mr. Goswami, also secretary of the All India Congress Committee. Officials deny charge Health officials denied any negligence on the part of the doctors or paramedical staff. Till Wednesday, Assam had recorded 48,161 positive cases with 115 of them having died and 33,428 discharged.

06 August 2020||Pune,||Former Maharashtra CM Shivajirao Patil Nilangekar passes away||Senior Congressman and former Chief Minister Shivajirao Patil Nilangekar passed away early Wednesday at a private hospital in Pune following a brief illness, said sources. He was 88. According to hospital sources, the condition of the veteran Congressman, who had recently tested positive for COVID-19 and had apparently recovered, deteriorated on Tuesday. “Mr. Patil Nilangekar passed away sometime around 2 a.m. today. The cause of death was kidney failure,” said a medical official. Mr. Patil Nilangekar, who hailed from Nilanga city in Latur district in the State’s Marathwada region, had the briefest run as Chief Minister of Maharashtra, serving in that capacity for less than a year between June1985 and March 1986 after controversial circumstances forced him to resign. The senior Congressman, who had been suffering from a number of comorbidities, including diabetes and high blood pressure, had tested positive for the novel coronavirus on July 16. He was later moved from Latur to Pune for further treatment. Condolences flowed in across the political spectrum, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Kohsyari and Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray along with senior Congress leaders paying tributes. “Shri Shivajirao Patil Nilangekar Ji was a stalwart of Maharashtra politics. He served the state diligently, especially working for the welfare of farmers and the poor. Anguished by his demise. My thoughts are with his family and supporters,” tweeted the Prime Minister. Mr. Thackeray said Mr. Nilangekar Patil was a freedom fighter with “commitment and firm views, who was at the forefront of the State’s development and progress of the Marathwada region”. Mr. Koshyari said that Mr. Patil Nilangekar had remained a popular man of the masses. “As a distinguished member of Maharashtra State Legislature for several terms and later as Chief Minister, he made invaluable contributions to the progress and development of the State,” the Governor said. Mr. Patil Nilangekar was the second politician from Latur to test positive for the virus. Earlier, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Ausau, Abhimanyu Pawar, had tested positive as well. A powerful cooperative leader from Marathwada who was active in the field of education, Nilanga was the stalwart Congressman’s virtual fiefdom with the Nilankegar family a dominant force in the politics of Latur and the Marathwada region. Before its delimitation in 2008, Mr. Patil Nilangekar won the Nilanga Assembly constituency in consecutive Assembly elections from 1962 to 1980, and then held the ‘pocket borough’ again in the 1990, 1999 and 2004 Assembly polls. His daughter-in-law Rupatai Patil Nilangekar, who is with the BJP, was Latur MP between 2004 and 2009 while his grandson Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar was a minister in the former Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government in Maharashtra. He is survived by his wife, three sons, a daughter and grandchildren. His last rites were performed in Nilanga.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/former-maharashtra-cm-shivajirao-patil-nilangekar-passes-away/article32281286.ece

06 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Over 3 lakh guest workers set to return to the city||The city looks set to witness a massive influx of guest workers from other States. The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) is gearing up for the return of these workers, who had earlier left for their native places amid the COVID-19 outbreak, by taking preventive steps to keep the spread of the virus in check. At least three lakh guest workers left the city and suburbs for their native villages amid the pandemic. In line with the standard operating procedure proposed by the State Labour and Employment Department for bringing guest workers back to facilitate a revival of industries, the government had granted permission to the district administration and GCC to issue e-passes to such workers. GCC Deputy Commissioner (Revenue and Finance) Meghanatha Reddy said e-passes for 98 applications from companies and manpower agencies had been approved in Chennai for transporting 1,025 guest workers. More e-pass applications are expected from industries and manpower agencies this month. The manpower agencies have been directed to bring the guest workers in their own vehicles at the company’s cost, and provide accommodation to them during the pandemic. The agencies have been advised to subject the workers to RT-PCR tests using their own funds and keep them under quarantine for 14 days on their premises before asking them to work. Officials of various line agencies would inspect the facilities before granting approval. Corporation officials would be responsible for transporting guest workers to hospitals in the event of an infection. Companies and manpower agencies have been asked to provide details of guest workers, including name, residential address, Aadhaar number, mobile number, workplace address, vehicle details and the proposed place of quarantine. The Corporation has advised officials to visit the quarantine sites for guest workers in areas registering a rise in cases. According to data provided by GCC, the case counts in other zones have reduced. The number of containment zones in the city has also reduced to 24, from over 1,000 in May. The percentage of positive cases reported among those with influenza-like illnesses at fever camps in the city has been 19 during the May-August period. The case fatality rate has crossed 3% in a few zones.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-3-lakh-guest-workers-set-to-return-to-the-city/article32281393.ece
06 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Mettur dam may soon witness a steep increase in inflow||The Mettur dam, the primary storage point of Cauvery water in the State, is likely to soon witness a steep rise in its inflow, with the authorities in Karnataka beginning to release huge quantities of water from the Kabini dam. At 4 p.m. on Wednesday, the Kabini dam, which recorded an inflow of 35,000 cubic feet per second (cusecs), saw an outflow of around 40,000 cusecs. On Tuesday, the outflow from the dam was around 30,000 cusecs. As of now, the Mettur dam has recorded an inflow of 3,600 cusecs. Heavy rain in the last few days over the Kabini’s catchment area at Waynad in Kerala has led to a huge inflow into the dam in Karnataka. Another development that comes as a relief to water managers of Tamil Nadu is that parts of the Cauvery’s catchment area in south interior Karnataka have also been recording substantial amounts of rain. Unlike the Kabini dam, which has reached around 90% of its capacity, the Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) dam’s figure is around 60% and, as such, the chances of the release of excess water from the dam are remote for the next few days. The inflow into the KRS dam was around 20,000 cusecs. As of Wednesday, the Mettur dam’s storage stood at 27.88 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft), as against a capacity of 93.47 tmc ft.

06 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||3,374 pregnant women have contracted infection: Minister||A total of 3,374 pregnant women have tested positive for COVID-19 so far and have been treated at COVID-19 maternity facilities, according to Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar. “These pregnant women had normal deliveries and caesarean sections at exclusive COVID-19 facilities,” he said. The Minister was taking part in a programme at the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital on Wednesday, during which the Rotary Club of Guindy donated a vehicle, a portable ECG and a cell counter. To a question on the State reporting over 100 fatalities in the last two days, he said that of them, the cause was COVID-19 in less than 10 deceased. Among these persons, the lungs were affected, leading to cytokine storm and hypoxia. “The others died of underlying diseases. Many had co-morbidities, such as obesity, uncontrollable diabetes, uncontrollable hypertension, tuberculosis, asthma and cardiac ailments. This is why we are stressing on the need to seek treatment early,” he said. He said that persons should not ignore symptoms of fever, cough, body ache, fatigue, loss of smell and taste. “A person’s condition turns critical when he/she ignores fever for two to three days and the lungs get affected. This becomes a challenge for doctors. Do not ignore early symptoms and delay treatment,” he said. ICU beds The Minister also inspected the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), where 150 beds have been readied for the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on the first floor of tower-3. “The unit is for emergency patients and those referred from other hospitals in a critical condition. The unit is well-equipped with high-flow nasal cannulas and ventilators,” he said. The hospital already has 1,000 beds for COVID-19 patients. Another 1,000 beds have been arranged to meet any needs in the future. He added that nearly 15,000 COVID-19 patients had been treated so far at the RGGGH. “The hospital has set up a zero-delay ward for COVID-19 patients and has also established a pre-arrival intimation system,” he said. The death reconciliation committee continues to analyse deaths and report them, the Minister added. “For instance, the Government Royapettah Hospital is not a COVID-19 hospital. So, if a person dies there, we conduct a test and if the sample returns positive for COVID-19, we include them in the COVID-19 toll,” he said, replying to a question on why some deaths were reported late in the bulletin. He added that 25,000 persons had utilised the tele-consultation platform, e-sanjeevini, in Tamil Nadu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/3374-pregnant-women-have-contracted-infection-minister/article32281430.ece
06 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||This villupattu artiste now sells cassava||In the Tamil month of Aadi ,  Thangamani, a villupattu artiste from Kanniyakumari district, would usually be singing songs in praise of folk deities on Tuesdays and Fridays. But the lockdown has forced him to take up a job, which he would not have otherwise. He now sells cassava ( maravallikizhangu ) on the roadside to earn a livelihood. “Normally, I will have programmes in the southern districts, except on Sundays and Wednesdays. My troupe has seven members and we would have programmes for 20 days. The pandemic has turned my life upside down,” said Mr. Thangamani, whose troupe Subaragam is popular in the southern districts. As he has to take care of his ailing parents, Mr. Thangamani decided to sell tapioca. He buys cassava roots from Kottar market and sells them on the roadside in Pattasalianvilai. His troupe members are eking out a livelihood as daily wagers. “I regularly buy 30 kg of cassava roots. If I am able to sell all of it, I earn Rs. 400 and get Rs. 300 as my share. The income is nothing when compared to the remuneration I get from villupattu singing. But I am left with no option,” said Mr. Thangamani, who performed 24 hours at a college in Tiruchi and got the title Kalamamani .

06 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Compliance with mask norm still lacking in city’s northern parts||The number of new COVID-19 cases have dipped in north Chennai but compliance with mask wearing and physical distancing norms is still lacking in a number of areas. Many residents and shopkeepers, who do use masks, tend to pull them below their chins, defeating the purpose of wearing one. When compared to previous months, usage of masks has improved across many parts of north Chennai. Nevertheless, it is common to see people in areas including Pulianthope, Vyasarpadi, Mint and Walltax Road without masks or wearing them improperly. According to officials of the Greater Chennai Corporation, the number of new cases has dipped drastically in Tondiarpet and Royapuram, zones that once accounted for a large portion of cases. “North Chennai now accounts for roughly less than 20% of new cases reported in the city every day. Tondiarpet has approximately 40 to 60 cases a day, while Royapuram reports 60 to 80,” an official said. ‘Yet to become a habit’ A resident of Vyasarpadi, Raghuraman (name changed on request), said many residents of his locality do not wear masks. “The awareness that masks should be worn has definitely reached people but it is yet to become a habit. Many do not wear them if they move around within their locality. Some find it difficult to wear masks continuously. A majority of office-goers do wear them when they start from their homes,” he said. Prabhdeep Kaur, scientist E/deputy director, Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Epidemiology, said overall, the compliance with wearing masks has improved. “We see good adherence in places such as shops. Everyone has a mask but many tend to pull it down. This is something that needs to be focused on as mobility has increased in the city and people should wear masks properly.” However, the practice of wearing masks as well as maintaining physical distancing should improve, she said, adding, “There is no spike in cases in north Chennai and the GCC has been testing a lot. Awareness is being created through NGOs, and what is required is behavioural change, which will take time. Proper use of masks should be implemented at the workplace level.” Ms. Kaur added that physical distancing norms were still not being followed in many public places. Focus on market areas An official of the GCC said the use of masks had definitely improved by leaps and bounds in north Chennai. “While travelling, we can see eight to nine persons out of 10 wearing a mask. This could be one of the reasons for the number of cases plateauing in parts of north Chennai,” a Corporation official said. “We have roped in staff of the Revenue Department to enforce mask wearing in market areas,” he added. The Corporation has distributed 40 to 50 lakh masks to residents in city slums, he said. “Certain areas in zone 4 — Tondiarpet — are still a challenge. We are continuing to create awareness. There should be no false sense of security or complacency if there are no new cases in the neighbourhood,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/compliance-with-mask-norm-still-lacking-in-citys-northern-parts/article32281398.ece
06 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||NGT directive to oil companies||The southern bench of the National Green Tribunal has directed oil companies to file a status report on the implementation of Vapour Recovery System (VRS) in fuel retail outlets in Tamil Nadu. It also ordered notice to the State government and the Central Pollution Control Board. The bench directed the oil companies to file a report on the volume of daily sales at retail outlets. The applicant, V.B.R. Menon, an advocate, moved the Tribunal stating that a large number of petroleum retail outlets in the State are situated and operating in close proximity to residential buildings and public places, such as schools, playgrounds and parks, thereby, endangering public safety, health and security. He submitted that as per various orders of the Principal Bench of the NGT, CPCB and the Supreme Court, installation of VRS Stage 1 and 2 was mandatory and binding on the oil companies, subject to the population around the outlets. “Hence, it has become necessary to put on hold any further opening/commissioning of petroleum retail outlets in Tamil Nadu without installing VRS, Stage 1 and 2 and until vapour recovery systems are installed in all the existing outlets within a prescribed time limit,” he said. Mr. Menon, further alleged that oil companies such as IOCL, BPCL, HPCL, Shell India and Nayara Energy Ltd are currently engaged in an expansion spree without complying with the orders on the installation of VRS, and sought a stay. Counsel for the oil companies Abdul Saleem objected to this. The counsel said that as per the directions of the Principal Bench, VRS must be functional by the time the sale of Motor Spirit touches 300 KL (kilo litre) in outlets in cities where the population is more than one lakh and within a period of three months in new retail outlets where the population is more than 10 lakh, and having a sale potential of 100 KL per month. In case of failure to implement this, environmental compensation can be levied, he submitted. So, the bench directed the oil companies to file a report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ngt-directive-to-oil-companies/article32281407.ece
06 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Case against holding govt. events with over 20 people closed||The Madras High Court on Wednesday closed a public interest litigation petition filed by activist ‘Traffic’ K.R. Ramaswamy to restrain the State government from conducting functions with the participation of more than 20 people until the threat of COVID-19 subsides. Justices M.M. Sundresh and R. Hemalatha closed the case at the admission stage itself after Advocate-General Vijay Narayan objected to the litigant’s plea and said that he could not complain about the Chief Minister, who was leading the fight against the pandemic. The judges, however, observed that all norms aimed at preventing COVID-19 should be followed when public functionaries attend private events. The A-G told the court that of late, Mr. Ramaswamy was filing cases loaded with political overtones than with public interest. He said the petitioner appeared to have objections to the Chief Minister travelling about freely when restrictions imposed under Section 144 of the CrPC were in place.  ‘At the forefront’ “The honourable Chief Minister is working for almost 16 hours a day. He is at the forefront in the fight against COVID-19. How can Mr. Ramaswamy say that the Chief Minister should not travel? It is very unfortunate,” Mr. Narayan said and urged the court to dismiss the case. He also pointed out that the High Court had imposed costs on the activist in at least three cases in 2011, 2014 and 2018, but he had not discharged those obligations. As per rules, such people should not be allowed to file PIL petitions in the future, he added. On his part, arguing the PIL through videoconferencing, Mr. Ramaswamy said that a law should be equal to all, including the Chief Minister, and hence he could not be seen travelling across the State and attending public functions with large gatherings. When the judges sought to know how else the Chief Minister could function, he said official work could be performed online.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/case-against-holding-govt-events-with-over-20-people-closed/article32281427.ece
06 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Medicos reach home, thanks to Sonu Sood||Hundred medical students, mostly graduates belonging to Tamil Nadu who arrived in Chennai on Wednesday, are full of gratitude towards Bollywood actor Sonu Sood. They were stranded in Moscow for the past several weeks. They had finished their course and were to return home in July, but got stuck there due to the COVID-19 lockdown. A graduate from Chennai said, “Our course ended on July 6. The Indian government’s Vande Bharat Mission was operating flights, but we were waiting to complete our course. We were hoping that the government would operate more flights. But no Vande Bharat flights were operated to Russia after July 6. We were trying to find out which airports were open. Unfortunately, all airports were shut and tickets were not available,” she said. The students began communicating with Ministers, the Prime Minister’s office and the Chief Minister. They also tried to organise a chartered flight, but couldn’t get permission for the same. “One of our friends mailed 15 officials and Sonu Sood, who was helping a lot of people reach home. We found on social media that he had arranged a chartered flight from Kyrgyzstan to Tamil Nadu. We only got a reply from Mr. Sood. We mailed him on July 23, and he responded the next day. He gave us his manager’s number for coordination. Within two to three days, he said he had arranged a flight from Moscow to Chennai. There was a slight delay in getting the required permission,” the student said. Initially, the plan was to airlift 200 students, but the number fell to 100. On July 31, Mr. Sood tweeted that he had arranged the airlift. He spoke with the students and assured them that the flight won’t be cancelled even if the number of students was low, the student said. Mr. Sood said, “I have been helping migrant labourers and students stranded in Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Cyprus and Manila. It has been hectic, talking to embassies and ambassadors day and night and connecting with students through Zoom. It’s not about money. When you are on a mission, you want to complete it. I haven’t been trained to do this, but I thought I must help these people out.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/medicos-reach-home-thanks-to-sonu-sood/article32281432.ece
06 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Madhavaram fruit market will function during Aug. 10 strike||The fruit market in Madhavaram will function on August 10 to avoid inconvenience to retailers. Wholesale fruit merchants said they would not down shutters but would extend their support for the strike proposed by other merchants. The Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peramaippu, along with various federations of Koyambedu merchants’ associations, had recently announced that vegetables, fruits and flower shops across the State would remain closed on Monday. They demanded that the traditional markets that have been closed in Tamil Nadu, including the Koyambedu Wholesale Market complex, be reopened. However, fruit merchants in Madhavaram decided to keep the nearly 300 shops open since it could affect customers and sales ahead of the festival season. Pamphlets on the decision were distributed to the traders on Wednesday. S. Srinivasan, president of the Chennai Fruits Commission Agents’ Association, said the market now received up to 1,500 tonnes of fruits daily and would receive an additional 100 tonnes next week. “We will extend our support to the traders who are taking efforts to reopen the Koyambedu market. We will also represent to the government on the issue,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/madhavaram-fruit-market-will-function-during-aug-10-strike/article32281395.ece
06 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chembarambakkam, Cholavaram lakes to get extra storage||With the Water Resources Department desilting the Chembarambakkam and Cholavaram lakes for over a month, the two reservoirs, which cater to Chennai’s drinking water needs, may gain additional capacity ahead of the northeast monsoon. Though the project began in September 2019, it was not consistent due to reasons such as getting environmental clearance, weather conditions and the lockdown. Spread over 2,552 hectares, the Chembarambakkam lake has been able to store 10-20% less than its original capacity of 3,645 million cubic feet (mcft) due to silt deposits. The waterbody currently has a storage of only 1,824 mcft. Officials said nearly 56,160 cubic metres of silt have been removed from the lake so far. This will also help in reducing flooding in the neighbourhood, they added. As the project has been devised on a revenue generation model, the contractor will pay for desilting and later sell the excavated earth. A revenue of nearly Rs. 1.13 crore has been generated so far. The department has planned to remove 151.80 lakh cubic metres of silt from Chembarambakkam and the process has been estimated to generate a revenue of Rs. 150 crore. Once the project is completed, the lake will have an additional storage of 536 mcft. Similarly, of the 38 lakh cubic metres of silt proposed to be cleared from the almost dry Cholavaram lake, nearly 97,428 cubic metres has been removed. Officials said these two lakes would have an additional storage capacity of a minimum of 50 mcft by October. Legal hurdles However, projects in the Poondi and Red Hills reservoirs have been stalled due to pending court cases and steady inflow. The lake in Red Hills is brimming with water this season. If the desilting project is completed, the four lakes will have an additional storage capacity of about 1,900 mcft. The department is hesitant to propose new projects based on the revenue model due to issues such as pending court cases, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chembarambakkam-cholavaram-lakes-to-get-extra-storage/article32281400.ece
06 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Folk artistes now make a living through awareness programmes||For the past four months, folk artists Merlin Singh and team mates from Kalappai Kalaikuzhu did not have any income. But now, with many NGOS roping them in for Community Intervention Programmes (CIP) of the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC), they are managing to run their households. The GCC along with NGOs, has been conducting CIPs to create awareness about COVID-19 in slums and other densely-populated areas. Recently, the team, in association with the Uravugal Social Welfare Trust, staged a performance to create awareness among homeless people in Chetpet and Mylapore. “Prior to the lockdown, we used to earn around Rs. 15,000 per month. This is because apart from programmes, we also impart folk art training in schools. Now, all the revenue has stopped,” Mr. Singh said. K. Jayakrishnan, a 37-year-old folk and theatre artiste, said many young folk artists have started looking for other jobs. “Many have become delivery boys. Luckily some NGOs have requested my team to be part of awareness programmes. So, I am able to make some money,” he said. S. Prabhakaran, a member of Uravugal Trust, said they pay the troupe for each programme. “We conduct at least three CIPs per week. When people see traditional arts being performed, they stop and watch. This helps us create awareness about the disease,” he explained. A GCC official said the awareness created by outreach workers and NGOs has helped control the spread of the virus. “They have been mainly asked to work in slums and densely-populated areas. They create awareness on hand-washing, wearing masks and physical distancing through various programmes,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/folk-artistes-now-make-a-living-through-awareness-programmes/article32281404.ece

06 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC orders notices to YouTube, Facebook||The Madras High Court on Wednesday ordered notices to the Centre, the State government and a host of private video streaming platforms on a public interest litigation petition seeking establishment of a body to censor videos uploaded on YouTube and those that were shared on social networking platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram. Justices M.M. Sundresh and R. Hemalatha directed State Government Pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan to take notice on behalf of the State government and permitted the petitioner’s counsel to issue private notices even to video streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Disney Hotstar, Voot, Sony Liv, MX Player and Zee5. The litigant, K. Suthan, a lawyer, had also sought censoring of web series, reality shows, short films and other such content telecast by Over The Top (OTT) media service platforms using the Internet. Notices were ordered to websites such as Behindwoods, Galatta, Cine Ulagam and India Glitz which have their own YouTube channels. The petitioner wanted interviews of film personalities and other video content created by these cinema-based portals to be subjected to censorship. He wondered why such content being available freely should not be censored, when such a requirement was mandatory for feature films. He said that videos circulated recently regarding the marriage of an actress and the reaction to it by others contained “intolerable and abusive words”. It was watched by more than 10 lakh viewers, he said. Further, referring to a video criticising devotional song Kandha Sashti Kavasam uploaded on the YouTube channel of Karuppar Koottam and other such content, the petitioner said that there was a dire necessity to censor such content, especially after the COVID-19 situation because of increased use of electronic gadgets by all, particularly school students. Concurring with the petitioner, the judges ordered notices, returnable by three weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-orders-notices-to-youtube-facebook/article32281413.ece
06 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC advances hearing of case filed by Deputy Speaker against Stalin, others||The Madras High Court on Tuesday advanced the hearing on an application preferred by Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly Deputy Speaker Pollachi V. Jayaraman to restrain DMK president M.K. Stalin, the latter’s son-in-law V. Sabareesan, Kalaignar TV as well as editors of Tamil journals Nakheeran and Junior Vikatan from making or publishing false or defamatory statements against him.  Defamatory articles Justice P.T. Asha advanced the date from August 18 to 13, after Mr. Jayaraman filed yet another application seeking an interim injunction urgently on the ground that Nakheeran reportedly continued to publish defamatory articles against him despite its counsel having accepted notice on the previous injunction application on July 20 and taken time till August 18 for filing a detailed counter affidavit. When the second injunction application was listed for deciding its maintainability, the judge ordered that it would instead be treated as an application for early hearing of the previous plea. She also expressed her displeasure over the alleged articles published after issuance of notices. “How can you take time for counter and continue the defamatory publication? Some discipline must be followed,” the judge said. The Deputy Speaker had filed the applications as part of a civil suit preferred by him seeking damages of Rs. 1 crore from Mr. Stalin and others for having reportedly linked his name with the Pollachi serial sexual assault and blackmailing issue. He claimed that speeches delivered by the leader of the Opposition were telecast on the television channel and that the two journals had also carried “false and defamatory” articles against him. While the plaintiff was represented by his counsel B. Arvind Srevatsa, advocates Manuraj Shunmugasundaram, P.T. Perumal and N. Ramesh — representing Mr. Stalin, R. Nakheeran Gopal and the Editor of Junior Vikatan respectively — agreed to get along with the case as ordered by the court and make their submissions on the injunction application on August 13. They also assured the court that the pleadings would be completed before the hearing. In his plaint, Mr. Jayaraman, 67, said, he was a member of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) for long and that he had been elected to the Legislative Assembly from Pollachi constituency for four consecutive terms, since 2001. He was also a former Minister for Industries, Environment, Pollution Control, Food, Civil Supplies and Cooperatives. He had assumed charge as Deputy Speaker in 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-advances-hearing-of-case-filed-by-deputy-speaker-against-stalin-others/article32281479.ece
06 August 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Bowser accident brings safety issues to the fore||An accident involving a fuel bowser (tanker) that took place in Cuddalore on Tuesday has once again brought into focus concerns regarding the safety of bulk supply. Sources said the tanker overturned on a main road while trying to avoid hitting a cyclist. The diesel that got spilt on the road was cleaned up by fire service personnel using foam. “Luckily, there was no fire or death due to the accident. There have been similar incidents elsewhere in the country as well,” said K. P. Murali, president, Tamil Petroleum Dealers’ Association. Consortium of Indian Petroleum Dealers general secretary K. Sureshkumar said, “We are very worried about the safety of the public and users.” “The Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation is only a licensing authority. The responsibility of regulation lies with district authorities, who already have enough on their plate. Fuel outlets only have licences to sell petrol and diesel at their locations. But these bowsers tank up at the bunks and carry them without following any safety measures. At times, one can see them unloading fuel by the roadside,” he said. Estimates show that there are around 800-1,000 bowsers of varying capacities in the State. They do not have the requisite licences, and hence, are considered illegal. Meanwhile, tenders have been invited from startups wanting to get into the business of door delivery of diesel to large volume users.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bowser-accident-brings-safety-issues-to-the-fore/article32281441.ece

While the stretch from Washermenpet to AG-DMS started operation last year, the one between AG-DMS and Saidapet was opened in 2018. The track needs special repairs like renewal of track fitting, fastening and other minor fixes, sources said. Chennai Metro Rail Limited officials said there was no cause for concern as the repairs were precautionary measures. However, sources said the need for repairs arose because the contractor had done a poor job. “The quality was unsatisfactory. We have noticed flaking on the surface of rails. It can happen after a lot of wear and tear but not this early,” they said.

In a statement, party founder S. Ramadoss said that the National Education Policy (NEP 2020) stated that all classical language institutes would be allowed to function autonomously, but under a university. “The Central government has said that would enable students in classical language institutes conduct multi-disciplinary research. This is not believable and it is unacceptable,” he said. According to him, the Centre has been taking several steps to shutdown the institute over the last few years. He felt that developing technology to improve use of Tamil only needed Tamil centric, multi-disciplinary approach. There are only seven classical languages and Tamil is the only classical language still spoken in India, he added. “Therefore, the Central government should take steps to honour the Tamil language. It should not insult the language by merging it with a university,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pmk-against-merger-of-institute-of-classical-tamil-with-university/article32281414.ece

06 August 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Issue of storage resurfaces as water level rises in Siruvani reservoir||As the water level rose up by another 4.39 feet to touch 28.5 feet mark in Siruvani reservoir in the 24 hours that ended 8 a.m. Wednesday, the question of how much storage will the Kerala Government allow has resurfaced. In the 24 hours, the Reservoir’s catchment received 200mm rainfall and the Siruvani foothills 98mm. Tuesday's 8 a.m. reading for the preceding 24 hours showed that the catchment had received 300mm rainfall, taking the water level to 24.11 feet. The full reservoir level is 49.50 feet. The water level rising drastically in two days has led the question – will the Kerala Government allow the water level to touch the full reservoir level or will it, as it did in 2019, restrict the water level to 44.50 feet. Following floods in the State a couple of years ago, the Government decided to reduce the water storage level all its reservoirs and the decision led to a reduction of around five feet in storage level in the Siruvani Reservoir. As a result, the water level did not surpass the 44.50 feet mark in 2019 even though the South West Monsoon was good in the catchment. The reduction in water storage level saw the Coimbatore city teeter on the brink in April-May this year as the water level almost touched the dead storage level. The city’s water managers said had the Government let the water level touch the full reservoir level, they would have had water to cater to the city's needs till June or perhaps the first week of July. The Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board draws water from the reservoir and gives it to the Coimbatore Corporation that distributes the water to around 25 of the 100 wards. Now, given the rise in water level, there were formal and informal talks going on to ask the Kerala Government to let the water level touch the full reservoir level, the sources said. The Tamil Nadu government had written to the Kerala government seeking restoration of the water storage level. And, the informal talk too was going on to prevail upon the government there. Sources familiar with the development said given the fact that Chief Ministers of the States had said that the inter-state differences would be resolved in friendly and cordial manner, a few persons from Tamil Nadu were in talks with Kerala politicians in this regard. They said that the talk was on and that it would be premature and detrimental to reveal the details or progress as that could jeopardize the effort.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/issue-of-storage-resurfaces-as-water-level-rises-in-siruvani-reservoir/article32281466.ece
06 August 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Association seeks steps for revival of micro units||Micro units in Coimbatore have appealed to the State government, seeking measures for their revival in the current COVID-19 situation. The Federation of Coimbatore Industrial Associations has written to the Chief Minister and the District Collector in this regard. It sought relaxations in lockdown restrictions, exemption from e-passes and 2% interest subvention for MSMEs. The federation said the government should permit inter-district travel for MSME owners without e-passes. Industries were unable to take up machinery maintenance and collect dues, it said. Further, as bus and rail services were suspended, workers were unable to return to Coimbatore for work from other districts and States. The government should exempt micro units from e-pass for inter-district travel. It should also issue business e-passes to suppliers who want to visit Tamil Nadu from other States and exempt them from mandatory quarantine. Bus and rail services should be resumed and MSME units exempted from total lockdowns on Sundays. In the memorandum to the District Collector, the federation said that the Prime Minister had announced a 2% interest subvention scheme for MSMEs in February 2018. The banks are reimbursed by SIDBI. However, several banks have not passed on the benefit to MSMEs. The micro units urged the Collector to intervene and ensure that MSMEs get the benefit. Every bank should assign an officer for the scheme, the federation said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/association-seeks-steps-for-revival-of-micro-units/article32281423.ece

06 August 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||RTE Act admissions in schools hazy||Education rights activists say that with big private schools in Madurai having unofficially completed the admission process and started online classes, there is no clarity on the status of 25% of seats to be allotted under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act. Documents obtained through Right to Information Act by Veronica Mary, a child rights activist, reveal that from 2014-15 to 2019-20, only 70.31% of the allotted seats have been filled in private schools across the State. Implementation of the RTE Act this year, may be further weakened, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is feared. According to the RTE Act, 25% of entry-level seats must be set aside for students from economically weaker sections of the society. Enquiries made to a number of big schools in the city revealed that many schools had completed the admission process, especially for kindergarten, and online classes were going on since June. “Children from underprivileged sections, whose parents are usually daily wage workers, depend on RTE seats to enter private schools. But, due to lack of clarity this year, these students will lose this opportunity,” says C. Perarivalan, State general secretary of Tamil Puligal Katchi, who has been working for admitting underprivileged students from Karumbalai area under the RTE Act. Mo. Pandiarajan, a member of Global Nursery and Primary Schools Association, says most private schools try not to admit students under the RTE Act due to non-disbursal of funds by the State government. ‘Government must act’ While this is the case under normal circumstances, the pandemic situation may worsen the implementation of the Act, says Ms. Mary. Pandemic, no excuse “The government must either take action against schools admitting students or announce online admission of seats under the RTE Act. Since the RTE admission process was held online for the past two years, COVID-19 pandemic could not be used as an excuse,” Ms. Mary adds. A Devaneyan, founder-director of Thozhamai, a non-governmental organisation, says the government must immediately issue guidelines regarding admissions under RTE Act. “The government may say the schools have officially not commenced the admission process. But it is the underprivileged students who stand to lose in the end,” he says. District Chief Educational Officer R. Swaminathan says there is no official order from the government permitting admissions for this academic year. “But, when admissions through RTE begins, all schools would have to compulsorily allocate seats for it,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rte-act-admissions-hazy/article32281410.ece

The order was issued to constitute a committee for suggesting measures for effective implementation of the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006, and the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Teachers’ Cadre) Act, 2019. The committee must look into the implementation of reservation in admission of students to undergraduate, postgraduate and Ph.D programmes, and recruitment of teaching and non-teaching staff. According to the order, the committee would be headed by the Director of IIT-New Delhi, with the Registrar of IIT-Madras being the convenor. Mr. Venkatesan said the committee was given one month’s time for submission of the report.  100 days since issuance “However, it has been more than 100 days since the issuance of the order. Hence, I have asked the Minister whether the committee has submitted the report,” he said. Such a report was necessitated due to the failure of the Central educational institutions in ensuring social justice to the deprived sections in admission and recruitment process. “The representation of SC/ST candidates in teaching and non-teaching posts was disproportionately low,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mp-enquires-about-status-of-report-on-iit-admissions-and-recruitment/article32281735.ece

06 August 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Sarabanga project will not affect Delta region’||The State government on Monday submitted before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court that Sarabanga Lift Irrigation Project, which would see excess water from Mettur reservoir diverted to dry tanks in Sarabanga basin in Salem district, would not have any adverse effect on Delta irrigation. The Public Works Department, in its counter affidavit, said that the government was considering the proposal to provide water to the region as early as 2012. The scheme on completion would benefit farmers and people in Edappadi, Sankagiri, Omalur and Mettur, and meet their agricultural and drinking water needs. The government constructed Kattalai Barrage across the Cauvery at Mayanur in Karur district in 2014 for the benefit of Delta irrigation. Also, work on a new barrage across the Kollidam between Adhanur and Kumaramangalam was under way. Surplus water could be saved there and utilised for the farmers of the region. Apart from this, a project named ‘Climate change adaptation programme in Cauvery Delta’, assisted by Asian Development Bank at a cost of Rs. 1,560 crore, was under implementation for improving irrigation in tail-end areas of the Delta region. Therefore, diverting 0.555 TMC water from Mettur reservoir, that too when it was surplus, would not have an effect on the Delta region, the counter affidavit said. Further, the State government submitted that since the diversion scheme was not for developing a new ayacut, and it was only for filling 100 dry tanks to sustain agricultural operations and address drinking water issues in Sarabanga basin, the question of consulting Cauvery Water Management Authority did not arise. Also, the contention that there had never been excess water in Mettur reservoir in the last few decades was not true. As per data available from 1936 to 2019, Mettur reservoir had had surplus water of more than 555 mcft in 43 years out of the 84 years, at the dependability of 51%. All norms and procedures were followed by the government towards the implementation of the project, the counter said. A Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and P. Rajamanickam adjourned the hearing in the public interest litigation petition filed by a group of Delta farmers who challenged the implementation of the Rs. 565-crore project. The petitioners said the Delta region was already suffering due to the lack of adequate water.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sarabanga-project-will-not-affect-delta-region/article32281734.ece

06 August 2020||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||1.18 lakh beds ready to treat patients||The number of beds in government hospitals and government medical college hospitals in the State had been increased to 1.18 lakh for treating COVID-19 patients, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan has said. After chairing a review meeting here on Wednesday to examine the ongoing anti-COVID-19 operations in the district and inspecting the Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital and a fever clinic, he said the number of beds had been increased to 1.18 lakh from 70,000 even as patients had been treated at several stages like hospitals, care centres and home isolation based on symptoms. Since some positive patients have other health issues and need oxygen support, the medical facility was being created additionally in hospitals at a cost of Rs. 150 crore. This work would be completed soon. He warned that hospitals charging exorbitantly for treating COVID-19 patients would have to face music as the government had started taking stringent action against those hospitals on receiving complaints from affected patients.“The affected patients or their relatives may register their complaints in this connection by calling 104,” he said. Medical waste generated during the pandemic should be handled with extreme care as per the protocol formulated by the World Health Organisation. When asked about the COVID-19 related deaths (58 deaths till August 4) in Thoothukudi, he said the district’s death rate was only 0.70% even as the State’s average stood at 1.62%, which is also significantly low.

Jayaseelan, Sub-Collector, Thoothukudi, Simranjeet Singh, City Health Officer Arunkumar, Dean, Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital Revathi Balan, and senior health department officials accompanied the Secretary during his visit to the Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital and the fever clinic at KVK Nagar. Later, the Health Secretary visited a containment zone at Armed Reserve Line in Palayamkottai along with Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish and Corporation Commissioner G. Kannan. He said the number of COVID-19 positive cases per day in Tamil Nadu had fallen from 7,000 to 5,000 which was a good sign. The government, which had so far conducted 28 lakh RT–PCR tests and is conducting 60,000 tests a day now, had instructed officials to increase the tests to identify patients at the earliest. Even though death rate in Tamil Nadu was just 1.62%, the government was working overtime to reduce it further. The Health Secretary said the number of containment zones in Tirunelveli City had come down from 500 to 160.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/118-lakh-beds-ready-to-treat-patients/article32281731.ece

06 August 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||At last, shops open at Kallikudi market||A handful of farmers’ groups took baby steps towards entering the retail market by setting up shop at the Central Market for Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers at Kallikudi on the outskirts of the city on Wednesday. The market, established on 9.79 acres with 830 shops and formally opened in September 2017, was originally intended to accommodate wholesale traders of the famous Gandhi Market in Tiruchi. However, with the wholesale traders resisting the move to shift them to the new venue, the complex built at a cost of Rs. 77 crore with NABARD funding lay in disuse. Following a stalemate, the Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business decided to allot some of the shops in the complex to Farmers Interest Groups (FIGs), Farmers Producers Groups (FPGs) and Farmers Producers Organisations (FPOs) so as to provide them a marketing outlet. The District Market Committee, functioning under the department, allotted 104 shops to 52 FIGs, FPGs and FPOs. Each group was allotted two shops at nominal rent. The shops were allotted only to active groups and the allotment was done by a district-level selection committee, sources in the Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business said. On Wednesday, some of the FIGs, FPGs and FPOs opened their shops by bringing in farm produce procured from their members. Although some of the groups were already into retail business, this is the first time that many of them were entering direct retail sales by opening shops at a market. Some of the groups brought in vegetables and fruits and a few others value-added products. The Tamil Nadu Banana Growers Farmers Producers Company in Namakkal district and WEFSA Farmers Producers Company of Perambalur were among those to set up shop. Though business was dull on the first day in the absence of “adequate publicity and absence of bus services,” the groups expressed confidence that they would succeed in their venture in the long run once the market became fully functional. “We brought in vegetables such as onions, brinjal and snake gourds in small quantities. But not many customers came in today as people are not aware of the market becoming functional. Our members had to take back their produce but we hope the situation will improve with better publicity and resumption of public transport,” said A. Arockiasamy, president, Manikandam-B FPG, which has farmers from Navalarkuttapattu, Thayanur and Punganur villages in Tiruchi as members. A. Subramanian, treasurer, Tamil Nadu Banana Growers Farmers Producers Company, which had brought in bananas and banana figs for sale, said sales could pick up in the long run once the market became fully functional. “We hear that the shops are in good demand from traders at the market,” he said. “We are confident that with public support, we can succeed in our venture. Public can get quality produce at cheaper rate at our shops here,” said M. Thangavel, president, Manikandam-A FPG. Although only a few of its members had brought in vegetables such as ladies finger and brinjal, more were planning to bring their produce in the days to come, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/at-last-shops-open-at-kallikudi-market/article32281782.ece

Maniyarasan appealed to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to intervene in the issue and take it up with the Centre to stop the recruitment and make necessary arrangement for employment of eligible candidates from Tamil Nadu in the railway workshop. Mr. Maniyarasan pointed out that the exercise of verification of certificates of 540 candidates selected through the Railway Recruitment Board for the post of Grade-III technicians at the workshop was currently underway. Barring very few candidates from Tamil Nadu, a vast majority of them were from north Indian States besides Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. He said even during the COVID-19 pandemic period candidates from north Indian states were given employment, ignoring eligible candidates from Tamil Nadu. The Railway Act Apprentices of the State were not given employment in the railways and many of them remained unemployed. The Periyakkam had been consistently fighting for providing 90% of jobs in railways and Central government-owned undertakings and offices functioning in Tamil Nadu to the candidates from the State. The outfit demanded that the railway administration completely withdraw the orders issued for recruitment of north Indian candidates at the workshop and wanted the selection of eligible candidates from Tamil Nadu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/recruitment-of-north-indians-at-railway-workshop-flayed/article32281790.ece

06 August 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||No takers for Vinayagar idols||Idol makers from Rajasthan, who would usually sell 1,500 Vinayaka idols during Vinayaka Chathurthi every year, are struggling to find customers for selling even 350 idols which they have made and stocked in the makeshift godowns. For the three families from Rajasthan, who are living in roadside tents in Palayamkottai, Vinayagar is everything as He feeds these families that sell His idols for Vinayaga Chathurthi celebrations. The sculptors, who used to start making the idols after Deepavali every year, would make a minimum of 1,500 idols in various heights ranging from 1 feet to 10 feet with chalk powder. These strikingly beautiful idols would be sold anywhere between Rs. 200 and Rs. 8,000. Mottaram, 48, and his friends, on returning from their native place in Rajasthan after celebrating Deepavali, started making idols for ‘Vinayaka Chathurthi 2020.’ However, COVID-19 outbreak crippled their work in March last. Even as successive lockdowns casting shadow over their business, the sculptors made 350 idols in the size ranging from 1 feet to 5 feet. “Our idols, known for its beauty and innovation, would sell like hotcakes every year. With a lot of expectations, we started the season’s work after last Deepavali celebrations. However, the pandemic, after seriously affecting our production, is forcing us to wait indefinitely for our customers from five southern districts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala,” says Mr. Mottaram. With the pandemic threat looming large, the sculptors stopped their production at just 350 instead of going in for the usual number of 1,500. Without any business queries and sale, Mr. Mottaram, who has taken loan from moneylenders here, is paying Rs. 18,000 a month as rent for the godown where he has kept the 350 idols. He expects that the buyers would start coming to his roadside shop from this week onwards as the festival falls on August 22. “After selling the idols here, we’d go back to our native place and return here only after Deepavali to start making idols for the next season. If we cannot sell the idols this year, we may not go to Rajasthan for Deepavali as we would not have money for the travel and celebrations there. With the ration rice we can buy here with the help of a few locals, we’re making gruel to feed our children now. We pin our hope on the God and wait with smaller number of idols for buyers,” says Mr. Mottaram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-takers-for-vinayagar-idols/article32281726.ece

Police officials confirmed that two people – in Sholur near Udhagamandalam and RC Colony in Udhagamandalam, died after being crushed by falling trees on Wednesday. They were identified as K. Ravi from Kakkanji Nagar in Sholur and Sadiq Ali from RC Colony. Officials said that Ravi was on his way to his farm when the incident occurred, while it was reported that Sadiq Ali was on his way to collect firewood. Meanwhile, wall collapses were also reported in numerous places, including at the Government Headquarters Hospital in Udhagamandalam. No injuries were reported in any of these instances. Rain continued to batter the district for the third consecutive day on Wednesday, with an average of 77.29 mm. of rain recorded throughout the Nilgiris. Avalanche recorded the highest rainfall till Wednesday morning with 390 mm., while Upper Bhavani received 306 mm. Gudalur and Devala received more than 125 mm.of rain over a 24-hour-period till Wednesday morning. District Fire Officer T. Immanuel said that over a 100 trees had become uprooted across the district, with Ooty-Gudalur Road among the areas most impacted. More than 200 personnel from the fire and rescue services from the Nilgiris and surrounding districts, who were dispatched to help with relief efforts worked throughout the clock to clear the roads. “We are facing a very difficult task, as the heavy winds are bringing down trees faster than we can clear them,” said Mr. Immanuel. The threat facing the tribal hamlet of Thenvayal, which was evacuated on Tuesday due to the rising waters from a nearby stream, has somewhat abated, officials said. More than 30 families from Thenvayal, Iruvayal and surrounding hamlets continue to be housed in the temporary relief camps. “More than the rain, heavy winds are bringing down trees, which are the biggest risk factor at the moment,” an official from the district administration said. Nilgiris District Collector J. Innocent Divya appealed to residents to stay indoors and not venture out unless absolutely necessary. The Collector also called on residents living near heavily wooded areas to move to the temporary relief shelters established across the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-crushed-to-death-after-trees-uproot-in-the-nilgiris/article32281475.ece

Revenue officials were in a fix as locals dug pits and parked a tractor on the approach road leading to the village, forcing them to bury the body in Periyakayntha Kulam village. According to sources, the victim, hailing from N.R. Pettai in Meledayalam, tested positive for COVID-19 a few days ago and was referred from the Tiruvannamalai Government Hospital to a private hospital in Vellore. He died on Tuesday evening and his body was brought in an ambulance to Meledayalam the same day. However, when the ambulance reached the entry point of the village around midnight, residents refused it entry to the village. Despite persuasion by Revenue officials, the locals refused to budge. The residents also contended that the victim owned houses in Vellore and Gingee but his family chose to perform the last rites at Meledayalam since it was their ancestral village. With the residents refusing to budge, the family waited for over seven hours with the ambulance in Gingee. The body was later taken to a graveyard in Periyakayntha Kulam village. A Revenue official said that the body was buried in Periyakayntha Kulam village following pleas by local residents. “The family also owned a house in Gingee and they accepted their request. The body was buried following safety protocols,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-obstruct-burial/article32281425.ece

06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||COVID-19 data suppressed deliberately, says MLA||Reiterating his allegation of deliberate suppression of COVID-19 data, DMK MLA P.T.R. Palanivel Thiagarajan said district-wise data on number of tests, beds, positivity and discharges would prove the daily State media bulletins false. “By providing inadequate, inconsistent and reduced data, the State government acts in a irresponsible manner and is betraying the people,” Mr. Thiagarajan told the media here on Wednesday. Stating that, world-wide, average daily deaths in any State and district will increase during the pandemic, he wondered how the numbers in Tamil Nadu shrink. “The State government is fudging the numbers as data collated from crematoriums in Madurai shows the deaths are much higher than official figures. The Health Minister proudly says there is 70% discharge of COVID-19 patients in the State, while the world-wide recovery rate is 95%,” he said. He also flayed the State Government’s reasoning for inclusion of 444 deaths to COVID-19 fatalities recently. “If the inclusion was due to May 8 guidelines of Indian Council of Medical Research, why was there an inordinate delay in implementing the guidelines till June 29,” he said. Mr. Thiagarajan, who himself is a data analyst, said that the huge variation in the positivity rate in a short span of time in different districts could not be relied upon at all. “While the government claims that spike in number of positive cases was due to increased number of testing, how is that the positivity rate increases manifold with increased number of tests. Then, why does the government reduces the number of testing from 63,000 a day to 52,000. This data is inexplicable and has no logic,” he said. Only a fair and district-wise data on testing, positivity and deaths will help people to understand the gravity of the pandemic situation and take due precautionary measures. “Playing politics with data is only suicidal and will in no way prevent the spread of infection,” he added. The MLA has filed a public interest litigation petition with the Madras High Court seeking district-wise COVID-19 data. Mr. Thiagarajan was also sceptical about sudden dip in number of positive cases (40) reported in Madurai district on Tuesday ahead of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s visit on Thursday.  There is nothing to be proud of 70% discharge when world-wide recovery rate is 95%  P.T.R.

Gandhirajan, an art historian. Mr. Gandhirajan said one can find several references in the Sangam literature about the practice of erecting hero stones in memory of leaders and chieftains. Both the hero stones found at the site could be around 500 years old. Mr. Gandhirajan said one of the stone was 8.8 feet tall and 4.5 feet wide. The lower portion of the stone depicts a man fighting a tiger. The upper portion shows a man riding a horse with a person beside him holding an umbrella. “This region comes under Mullai (forest) landscape. One can infer from the stone that cattle herders tried to protect their cattle from tigers in those days. Due to people encroaching on tiger habitat, there were many instances of human-animal conflict in this region,” he said. Such hero stones could also found in many northern districts. “However, this one is huge. Usually, they measure only up to five feet. Also, the sculpture has intricate details,” he added.  The second stone was found around 50 metres away. It was four feet tall and 2.5 feet wide. The lower portion of the stone depicted a woman holding a pot and the upper portion showed a man riding a horse, with a person holding an umbrella standing next to him. Mr. Gandhirajan said stones belonging to the microlithic period, dating back to 3,000 to 4,000 years, were found at the site. Iron age remains, including iron slags, were also found.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-hero-stones-found/article32281749.ece

In a memorandum to the Chief Minister, federation general secretary Arupathy P. Kalyanam said the kuruvai crop cultivated in April and May was ready for harvest, which would take place in full swing in areas where it was cultivated using filter point irrigation facilities. Since the monsoon had become active over the delta it would be difficult for ryots to comply with the moisture-level criterion for measuring the kuruvai crop at direct purchase centres (DPCs). Hence, the federation demanded that portable dryers be made available to farmers to get their produce dried up to meet the moisture-level norm while measuring paddy at DPCs. Further, setting up temporary sheds with minimum expenditure at open space DPCs would help farmers save their produce from getting drenched in the rain. It also demanded that additional DPCs be opened in areas where kuruvai crop harvesting would be taken up in full swing in August and September. Requesting the State government to offer the minimum support price announced by the Union government for 2020 kharif season for paddy procured at DPCs from August 1, the federation also sought incentives on a par with the amount announced by States such as Chhattisgarh  and Kerala. Stating that around 50,000 tonnes of TKM 9 variety (red rice) were likely to be harvested in the delta region, the federation urged the Tamil Nadu government to procure the produce and transport it to other States such as Kerala through Food Corporation of India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/delta-ryots-demand-portable-dryers-for-kuruvai-crop/article32281786.ece

In October last, the Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department received a loan of Rs. 3.3 crore from Asian Development Bank as part of a group tender to give a facelift to major monuments in the State. Constructed in 1636 A.D., the Tirumalai Nayak Palace is spread over 20 acres. Stability improvement, weatherproof, whitewash and carpentry work will form the renovation work, says R. Sivanandam, Deputy Director, Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department. Once completed, visitors can enjoy an enhanced experience of the sound and light shows held inside the palace every evening. Around 75% of the renovation works have been completed, he said. Assistant Executive Engineer K. Olimalik says whitewashing and weatherproofing are yet to be completed. “The unique part of the project is non-use of cement till date. We are heavily reliant on river sand from the Cauvery delta and limestone from Sattur and Kazhugumalai as we want to maintain the quality of the age-old structure.” Since the materials have to be transported and labourers are from north India, there is a delay in completing the project. Also, mixture of limestone and other compounds needs to be preserved for two days before being used. It is yet another reason for the delay, a source points out. “Cracks were found on domes while whitewashing. We will work on them and paint over the graffiti. So the works will go on till September,” Mr. Olimalik says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mahal-renovation-to-be-completed-by-september/article32281724.ece

Making a different drink each day, she travels across the city to distribute them at various locations. B. Sudha started off as a domestic help and then turned to catering meals after she lost the job. While supplying meals to customers, she noticed that sections of the public required health supplements and decided to distribute them, especially to frontline workers, free of cost. Since April, Ms. Sudha, who lives near Main Guard Gate, stocks two pots filled to the brim with different varieties of porridge, including broken wheat and millets, each morning and health drinks made of tulsi, ginger, pepper and other concoctions in the evening. “My trip usually begins near Fort Station Road, and I go through East Boulevard Road, G-corner, Gandhi Market and back home,” she says. While preparing the concoctions, she ensures that all natural ingredients are used. “Despite being a single mother with two children, I find the need to give back to society,” she says. Her husband died of ill-health seven years ago and she has been the sole breadwinner of the family since then. “Wealth is not permanent but health is. If I am able to help keep someone healthy, then my work is worthwhile,” she says. Police personnel, sanitary workers of Tiruchi Corporation, load men at Gandhi Market and even passers-by consume the health drinks. Ms. Sudha’s friends and relatives contribute for purchase of ingredients for the health drinks, while two of them help her in making them. Dstribution, however, is her job. “Initially we considered dividing it, but I would have to depend on others for that,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fighting-the-pandemic-woman-pitches-in-with-free-health-drinks/article32281788.ece

A Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and P. Rajamanickam directed the Collector to file the status report and asked if the sand quarried was used for construction activities of government projects or sold to private parties. In his petition, V. Jeevakumar from Budalur said the government had issued environment clearance to operate a sand quarry in Thiruchenampoondi in Budalur. But the clearance was issued in violation of norms. The quarry site was not demarcated by boundary stones and the exact quantity of sand to be quarried was not scientifically assessed. Illegal sand quarrying was rampant in the area, he said. The government had proposed to declare the Cauvery delta a protected agriculture zone. Therefore, the court must direct the State Government not to carry out sand quarrying operations in the delta region, he said. The court adjourned the hearing to September 2.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-seeks-status-report-on-sand-quarrying/article32281727.ece

Other taluks, including Gokak, Nippani, Hukkeri and Athani, received intermittent rain. The District Statistics Office said said that the first five days of August saw 650 mm of rain as against an average 46 mm for the period. Of this, 253 mm was received on Tuesday and Wednesday. Heavy rain in South Maharashtra led to the release of water into the Krishna and its tributaries, with the neighbouring State releasing 48,500 cusecs of water into the river course. This increased the water levels in seven rivers and their tributaries in Belagavi and Bagalkot districts. Bridges in Jatrat, Akkol, Bhoj , Karadaga and Kunnoor were under water by Wednesday morning. However, traffic was not affected as people used alternative routes. The bridge at Inamhongal village was submerged, affecting the movement of vehicles between Dharwad and Saundatti. Residents of some areas in the city were inconvenienced by water-logging. Water entered houses in Maratha Colony, Mandoli Road, MG Colony in Tilakwadi, Bandhur Galli, Hindalga and Ganeshpur and surrounding areas. Home-makers were busy throwing out water from their houses. “June and July were dry months compared to the average rainfall in earlier years. The rainfall in August seems to have over-compensated our rainfall,” said Uday Kinjawadkar, a resident of Mandoli Road, one of the areas that was hit by water-logging. Officers said that water supply to Belagavi city could be affected as the reservoir at Rakkaskoppa village was nearing the full reservoir level. If it overflows, water supply to the city could be affected, said a city corporation officer The Markandeya is overflowing near the waste weir near Kadoli village. But there was no damage reported, officers said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/heavy-rain-hits-life-in-belagavi/article32281559.ece

06 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Facing a surge in cases, BBMP struggling to hire paramedics||With the number of COVID-19 cases in Bengaluru on the rise, the civic body is desperately looking for medics and paramedics. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has been advertising almost every day and has organised six walk-in interviews at Town Hall over the last 10 days, the most recent being on Tuesday. The response has been lukewarm prompting the BBMP to come up with different strategies to incentivise health professionals. In its effort to fight the pandemic, the BBMP has roped in not only allopathic doctors, who have completed their MBBS, but also dentists and those from other streams, such as homeopathy, unani and ayurveda. They have been able to recruit 253 doctors, of whom only 21 are MBBS graduates. But the biggest shortage is that of paramedical professionals, including nurses and lab assistants. “As per our estimates, we may need nearly 1,000 paramedical professionals in the weeks ahead if we are to ramp up testing in the city,” said civic Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad. At the walk-in interviews, BBMP has been able to recruit only 154 so far. “At present, we have 151 mobile testing units, which we want to ramp up to at least 500, to reach a target of 20,000 tests a day. Each mobile unit needs at least one paramedic, if not two,” said Mr. Prasad. BBMP wants to deploy a trained paramedic in all ambulances transporting COVID-19 patients to hospitals. Right now, there is only a helper accompanying the driver. “The civic body is also planning to introduce beds with oxygen supply at 85 Primary Health Care Centres in the core city, for which we will need paramedic staff to work in shifts,” said D. Randeep, Special Commissioner, Health, BBMP, adding the Medical Education Department had deputed over a 100 staff nurses to the civic body on Wednesday. “The lukewarm response is definitely because of the fear of contracting COVID-19. We want to assure people that we will provide for Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits and all other safety gear. This is a public health crisis when we need health professionals to serve people. We appeal to them to come forward and work with us,” said Mr. Prasad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/facing-a-surge-in-cases-bbmp-struggling-to-hire-paramedics/article32281358.ece

However, people have been advised to wear masks when they are not exercising. The guidelines issued by the Department of Youth Empowerment and Sports have also asked gyms to provide pulse oximeters to help users know the blood oxygen saturation level before commencing activities. Those having less than 95% of blood oxygen will not to be allowed go ahead. It is also mandatory for gyms to ensure availability of disinfectant wipes and paper towels. The gyms are supposed to check the temperature level of all the users before allowing them inside and those having fever or any infection are not to be allowed. It is mandatory for gyms to maintain a record of various details, including mobile numbers, age and residential address of the users. While the gyms in containment zones are not allowed to function, those above 65 years of age and those below 10 years besides pregnant women are not allowed to enter gyms. Gyms are scheduled to restrict the number of users by allocating a minimum space of about 4 square metres per person. To ensure this, they have been advised to operate in shifts so that the users could be spread over. Similarly, they are supposed to ensure respiratory hygiene inside the gym and shift the equipment to open areas as far as possible. The guidelines have advised gyms to take up group activities online as far as possible and strictly avoid activities that involve making noise or laughing such “laughter yoga.” The instructors have to maintain a distance of six feet from the users and the staff from containment zones are barred from attending to duty.

06 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State shows signs of recovery in some areas of economy||With Karnataka stepping out of the lockdown, signs of recovery were witnessed in some areas of the State economy such as registration of vehicles, e-way bills and consumption of electricity. In the State, vehicle registration rose sharply from 37,831 in May to 92,196 in June. The strongest pick-up in registrations in June over May was witnessed in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Delhi, the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) of the Centre said in its report for July. At the national level, vehicle registrations rose to 9.9 lakh in June from 2.1 lakh in May, though it is still lower than previous year levels. The year-on-year (YoY) contraction eased from 88.6% in May to 41.6% in June, the report noted. In Karnataka, e-way bill generation improved significantly at Rs. 86,437 crore in June as against Rs. 63,698 crore in May. Value of e-way bills suggestive of intra and inter-State movements of goods, also picked up strongly in June over May, across all States. At the national level, e-way bills improved from Rs. 8,98,714 crore in May to Rs. 12,40,092 crore in June. There was a recovery in GST collections in the unlocking phase. The State GST collection stood at Rs. 6,710 crore in June, as opposed to Rs. 2,028.54 crore in April and Rs. 4,508.64 crore in May. However, it was Rs. 7,144 crore in the pre-lockdown March. At the national level, GST collections stood at Rs. 87,422 crore during this July, 86% of the figure during last July. The revenues for June (Rs. 90,917 crore) were higher than in July. However, it is to note that during June, a large number of taxpayers paid taxes pertaining to February, March and April, 2020, on account of the relief provided due to COVID-19. Electricity consumption altered in June as compared to May, with strongest recoveries in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, and Chhattisgarh. Electricity consumption in Karnataka stood at 5,293 mega units (MU) in June as against 6,046 MU in May, the Centre said. With regard to job creation under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme, the State created 245 lakh person days in June against 209 lakh person days in May. The DEA report said, “As the Indian economy stepped out of the nationwide lockdown in phases since May, economic activity picked up.” It further said the future economic recovery of India was crucially linked to how the COVID-19 infection curve evolved across States. “With the forecast of a normal monsoon at 102% of long-period average, agriculture, which contributes about 15% of total gross value added, is set to cushion the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Indian economy in 2020-21,” the report noted. “Though the country is well on the path to a recovery from a trough in April… the increase in COVID-19 cases and subsequent intermittent lockdowns make the recovery prospects fragile,” the DEA said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-shows-signs-of-recovery-in-some-areas-of-economy/article32281387.ece
06 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Teleconsultation causing a delay’||With complaints of hospital admission denials and treatment delays continuing to pour in following the rise in COVID-19 numbers, hospital authorities have said that staff shortage is one of the major causes. The shortage of doctors has also been attributed to a sizeable number of doctors sticking to teleconsultation without opening their clinics, which, according to hospital authorities, is leading to a pile-up of non-COVID-19 cases at hospitals. In some other cases, hospital authorities have also alleged that the underplaying of symptoms by patients and doctors over teleconsultation had resulted in delayed admission in COVID-19 cases. Prasanna H.M., president-elect, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANHA), told The Hindu that doctors over the age of 60 were justified in sticking to teleconsultation, but the others continuing to consult only online was leading to a shortage of doctors. “They need to start working, taking adequate protection. It is up to the individual doctor’s conscience,” he said. He also alleged that severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) cases were being reported late because of misreading of symptoms. “Under normal circumstances, people would see a heart specialist for mild gastritis. Now, people are underplaying symptoms. They have to be honest with their symptoms. Of late, SARI and ILI cases are coming late and most of them are COVID-19 patients and we are not able to save them. Doctors too may miss out on the warning signs over teleconsultation,” Dr. Prasanna said. Healthcare tech company Practo released a report last month revealing that five crore Indians accessed healthcare online in the last three months, recording a 500% increase in online doctor consultations since March, 80% of them were first-time users. The insights report also claimed that in-person doctor visits dropped 67%. Who are in demand Gynaecologists, general practitioners, and dermatologists were the most consulted specialists, accounting for 51% of the overall consultations, while tele-ENT specialists witnessed a 600% growth as seasonal allergies were confused with COVID-19 symptoms, the report stated. In March, the Karnataka Medical Council (KMC) released a set of guidelines for teleconsultation, which included permission to consult online for “straightforward simple ailments” such as short-duration fever, cough, headache, and loose motion as a part of primary healthcare. It specified that the practitioner should have the previous medical record of the patient seeking e-consultation. It also mentioned that such virtual consultations were allowed if the practitioner did not need to examine the patient and if the patient was able to understand the prescription and could get clarity from the conversation. H. Veerabhadrappa, president, KMC, said communication problems were also possible in teleconsultation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/teleconsultation-causing-a-delay/article32281355.ece
06 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||ICMR-approved mobile lab to cut down testing time||To ramp up diagnostic capabilities and cut down the turnaround time from sample collection to issuing the test report, which usually takes up to three days, faculty from IISc. have developed one set of ICMR-approved RT-PCR mobile testing labs. Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar, who inaugurated the labs in the city on Wednesday, said the Mobile Infection Testing and Reporting (MITR) Labs is an end-to-end solution for COVID-19 testing. India’s first “This is India’s first and only ICMR approved BSL-2+ compliant mobile diagnostic lab wherein sample collection, processing and test using RT-PCR can be done on site and the results can be uploaded to ICMR portal,” he said. Sai Siva Gorthi, associate professor, Optics and Microfluidics Instrumentation Lab, Department of Instrumentation and Applied Physics, who led the team that developed the mobile lab, told The Hindu that one set of the mobile labs comprises three vehicles. While one van is for sample collection, another replicating the BSL-2 lab is for sample processing. The third van is used for molecular testing analysis and to prepare reports. “Processing and testing of the samples cannot be done in the same vehicle as the RNA of the virus has to be isolated. These mobile labs enable significant reduction in turnaround time from 2-4 days to 4-12 hours for the confirmatory test of COVID-19 using RT-PCR. We can process over 100 samples per shift and around 4,500 a month,” he said. MITR Labs can be used for testing of other viral and bacterial infections such as H1N1, HCV, HBC, TB, etc., prof. Gorthi pointed out. Designed and developed by IISc. along with a faculty startup ShanMukha Innovations Pvt. Ltd., the first set of MITR labs have been successfully tested with the BSL-3 central lab operational at the Center for Infectious Disease Research (CIDR), IISc. First set The first set of the mobile labs have been handed over to Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences and will be operated through Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute. The labs have been developed with CSR support from SBI Foundation and Tata Motors. Additional funding was received from Collins Aerospace through United Way Bengaluru and Borqs software solutions, the professor added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/icmr-approved-mobile-lab-to-cut-down-testing-time/article32281362.ece
06 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Dispute over years of govt. service keeps retirement benefits away||A section of government officials who have retired post 2012 have been at loggerheads with the government over qualifying for full pension benefits. For, those who have not put in 30 years of service have not been receiving full pension despite rulings from courts, including the Supreme Court. The matter came to a head again recently with the PWD in June this year denying full pension benefits to four employees despite the September 2019 KAT award which they say is in their favour. Over the years, as many as 2,000 employees have been denied full pension over the contention of service years. The issue pertains to Rule 247 A of the Karnataka Civil Services Rules (KCSR) of July, 1978, that entailed full pension benefits to those who have not completed full service of 30 years. While 33 years of service in government was considered for full pension earlier, it was brought down to 30 years in 2019. This has particularly affected stipendiary graduates, daily wage workers and many others who would be absorbed in the department after certain years of work. Their work done prior to absorption is not counted at the end of total service. While up to eight years of additional service could be added to this period earlier, in 2012, it was reduced to two years. “Net result has been apart from reduced pension, including family pension, this category of government employees have been losing out while the death-cum-retirement grant is fixed and leave is encashed,” a retired PWD official said. The KAT had pointed out in its order in 2019 that the matter had been settled by the tribunal, Karnataka High Court, and the Supreme Court in the past, and observed that the government does not have the Constitutional right to discriminate among employees by changing law or issuing notification from time to time. KAT had ordered extension of benefit of qualifying service of eight years under Rule 247-A of KCSR rules. The PWD employees ask how they could lose out on benefit despite such a direction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dispute-over-years-of-govt-service-keeps-retirement-benefits-away/article32281381.ece

The union has sought a direction to the State government to issue necessary SOP for factories and other establishment to protect health of the workmen in view of the pandemic. Pointing out that managements of establishments follow different procedure and the trade unions find it difficult to deal with the case of workmen, the petitioner has pointed out that it has already gave representations to the Chief Minister and the Principal Secretary, Labour Department for issuing a SOP for factories and other establishments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/high-court-asks-state-govts-response-on-petition-seeking-paid-quarantine-leave-for-workers/article32281383.ece
06 August 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||EIA: HC restrains Centre||The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday restrained the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change from publishing the final notification based on the draft notification of the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA)-2020 till the next date of hearing on a PIL petition. The court, however, clarified that the Ministry can take all further steps based on the draft EIA-2020 except issuing final notification, and the Ministry could move the court for vacating the order against publishing the final notification if reasonable time to file objections and suggestions were provided after publicising draft EIA-2020 in Kannada language. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the interim order on the petition filed by United Conservation Movement Charitable and Welfare Trust, Bengaluru, seeking a stay on the draft EIA-2020 complaining that notification was not published in Kannada language. The draft EIA-2020, dated March 23, 2020, gave 60 days as per the law for public and other stakeholders to submit objections and suggestions. Later, taking note of COVID-19 lockdown, the last date to respond was initially extended till June 30, and again extended till August 11. The Bench, however, noted that Ministry’s counsel could not give a positive assurance on behalf of the Ministry that a reasonable time would be given to submit objections and suggestions after publicising the notification in Kannada. The Bench noted that many people, not knowing English and Hindi languages, could not have responded in view of the lockdown and non-availability of notification in Kannada. Earlier, the Ministry’s counsel said that a proposal to extend the August 11 deadline to submit objections and suggestions is being considered and a decision is expected shortly and clarified that the Ministry was committed to giving wide publicity for the draft EIA-2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/eia-hc-restrains-centre/article32281385.ece

06 August 2020||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Rain severs road connectivity||With incessant rainfall lashing Dharwad district since Tuesday evening, life was thrown out of gear on Wednesday. Several streams were in spate, severing road connectivity at a few locations. The overflowing Tuppari Halla has severed road connectivity between villages on Saundatti Road near Harobelavadi. As the bridge across the stream was washed away during the floods in 2019, the administration had taken up construction of a new bridge, work on which is in progress. As a temporary road constructed to facilitate the bridge construction is inundated, road connectivity between Inam Hongal and Harobelavadi has been severed. With good rainfall in the Kalghatgi and Alnavar region, the Davagi Nala in Alnavar is overflowing. Since the nala is the main water supply source, people of the town are happy. Meanwhile, residents in low-lying areas in the twin cities faced hardships as rainwater inundated various residential localities. Bhavikatti Plot and Vijayanand Nagar and other areas in Dharwad were inundated and there were reports of rainwater entering houses. In Dharwad roads, near Murugha Mutt and Toll Naka remained water-logged. In Hubballi too, several low-lying areas in Old Hubballi were inundated. Due to heavy inflow, the Unkal Lake in Hubballi is overflowing causing apprehensions among residents of the localities downstream. In the rural areas of the district, the overflowing Bennihalla, the Tuppari Halla and other streams have entered farmland leading to apprehensions of crop loss among farmers.  Rescued At Morab village in Navalgund taluk, a man, who faced the threat of being washed away in the overflowing Tuppari Halla, was rescued by locals.

He has named it ‘Kargil Vana’, as a mark of respect for his admiration for armed forces personnel. Sachin Bhide, 47, from Thambettu in Mundaje was keen on joining the Army, but could not succeed. My cousin Nithin Bhide is a colonel with the Indian Army, Mr. Bhide told The Hindu . His admiration for the armed forces only increased after doing the Amarnath Yatra and subsequently, visiting Dras in Kargil. An active member of Sahyadri Sanchaya, a group of environmentalists in the region, Mr. Bhide decided to give back to nature and at the same time show his respect to the armed forces. Last year, he got about 800 to 900 fully grown, milk-yielding rubber trees removed from his plot and planted about 800 saplings. When he was thinking of inaugurating the Kargil Vana, torrential rain and landslips in the region upset his plan. This year again, Mr. Bhide replanted the saplings, all native to the Western Ghat region and many of them fruit-bearing. He got the vana inaugurated by ex-servicemen from Belthangady. On Monday, when everyone was celebrating Raksha Bandhan, Mr. Bhide celebrated ‘Vruksha Bandhana’ where he along with four ASHAs — Chandravathi, Jayanthi, Gayathri, and Shashi — tied rakhis made of coconut fronds. “We tied rakhis to 527 saplings in memory of 527 Kargil martyrs,” he said. Sahyadri Sanchaya’s leading force Dinesh Holla said ‘Vruksha Bandhana’ was a true gesture towards restoring the lost bond with nature. Mr. Bhide said he would offer free boarding and lodging to members of Kargil war martyrs’ families if they wish to visit ‘Kargil Vana’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/agriculturist-removes-rubber-trees-to-plant-fruit-bearing-ones/article32281572.ece

06 August 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||How about making turmeric Ganesha idols?||This festival season, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) is promoting “health-friendly and eco-friendly” Ganesha idols made of turmeric. While KSPC every year takes up a campaign to dissuade people from buying PoP idols, this is a novel initiative in times of the COVID-19 pandemic. “People need not have to go searching for the clay idols in the market. They can make the idol from turmeric, which is also believed to have many medical values,” said a KSPCB official. The board has released videos on YouTube as part of its campaign to demonstrate idol making from turmeric. “The idols made from turmeric and dough can be immersed at home and the water can be used to sanitise homes. The idols made from Plaster of Paris and the painted ones are not eco-friendly. Tiny turmeric idols can help save waterbodies,” said the board. The campaign has set a target of one million home-made turmeric idols this festival. B.M. Prakash, Senior Environment Officer, KSPCB, Mysuru, said the response to the campaign was overwhelming with many volunteering to support the cause and make it successful as the benefits are manifold in view of the pandemic. The Karnataka Milk Federation, popular ready-to-eat food and snack makers, and others have launched the campaign with printing messages on packets for eco-friendly festivals with home-made idols. The messages are prominently printed on the ‘Nandini’ milk sachets. A public sector oil company too has joined the campaign and vehicles transporting petroleum products have pasted stickers supplied by the board for celebrations with turmeric idols. Agarbatti brands are also promoting the cause with messages on incense stick packets. Electricity supply companies are also printing messages on the monthly bills promoting eco-friendly celebrations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/how-about-making-turmeric-ganesha-idols/article32281365.ece

Kodagu has been on the edge with incessant rain battering the district since the last few days. This is the third year in a row that the district is receiving heavy rainfall in August after a weak spell of monsoon in June and July. Kodagu district received 269 mm of rainfall since August 1 as against a normal of 120 mm for the same period, which is 124% above the long term average, as per the KSNDMC report. Heavy to extreme heavy The India Meteorological Department has issued red alert in Kodagu, Shivamogga, Hassan, Chikkamagaluru, Uttara Kannada, Udupi, and Dakshina Kannada and has forecast very heavy to extreme heavy rain over coastal and Malnad districts of the State. Interior parts of Kodagu have been disconnected due to disruption in transportation caused by overflowing rivers and rivulets, while uprooted trees and electricity poles have blocked the roads in many parts of the district. Around 20 families have been evacuated to a relief centre in Virajpet. The Cauvery was overflowing at Triveni Sangama and road connectivity linking Bhagamandala with Madikeri and Napoklu was disrupted. The outflow from the Harangi reservoir was stepped up and discharge was at the rate of 10,689 cusecs, which will augment the inflow into the KRS dam that is located in the downstream. The outflow from the Kabini reservoir at H.D. Kote in Mysuru district was increased from nearly 20,000 cusecs on Tuesday to over 50,600 cusecs on Wednesday. The authorities said the water level in the dam was 2,280 feet against the full reservoir level of 2,284 feet. Malnad region Normal life in many parts of Hassan, Chikkamagaluru and Shivamogga has been badly hit following incessant rain since the last four days. Many villages have lost road connectivity after hundreds of trees have been uprooted. The rivers are in spate and inflow to the reservoir has been on the rise, while other waterbodies are overflowing. Some of the worst affected regions include parts of Hosanagara, Thirthahalli, Sagar, Soraba, Sringeri, Mudigere, Koppa, N.R. Pura, Sakleshpur, and Alur taluks. Travellers on the Charmadi Ghat had a tough time as trees that had fallen on the road obstructed their movement. Landslips have been reported on the road connecting Kalasa and Kudremukh in Mudigere taluk. Shivamogga district registered an average rainfall of 73 mm against the normal of 22 mm on the day. In Hassan, the average rainfall was 39 mm, while the normal was 8 mm. Chikkamagaluru district registered 66 mm of rainfall against the normal of 17 mm.

Maharashtra impact In north Karnataka, Belagavi district on the first five days of August received 650 mm rainfall against the average of 46 mm for the period. Of this, 253 mm was received on Tuesday and Wednesday. Making matters worse, heavy rain in south Maharashtra led to release of water into the Krishna and its tributaries. Maharashtra released around 48,500 cusecs of water into the Krishna and tributaries. This increased water level in the seven rivers and tributaries in Belagavi and Bagalkot districts, resulting in several bridges being inundated. The water levels in Almatti dam has been increasing steadily.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rain-intensifies-imd-issues-red-alert/article32281380.ece

Due to prevailing pandemic conditions, festival organiser Atta Galatta will release all content, including readings, videos, performances, talks and interviews, on the Bengaluru Poetry Festival site and social media on August 9. This year, the festival revolves around poets whose work reflects an Indian ethos. One of the highlights will be a reading of the works of Telugu poet Varavara Rao, who was arrested in connection with the Bhima Koregaon case. Kannada poet Pratibha Nandakumar has curated a selection of his poems that have been translated into other languages and these will be presented at BPF. “Pratibha and other poets will be reading Varavara Rao’s poems at the festival. The community of poets all over are raising their voice in protest over his unjust detention,” said Subodh Sankar, who conceptualised the annual festival with Lakshmi Subodh. While the lockdown has played spoilsport to many events, the organisers of the Bengaluru Poetry Festival have used it as an opportunity to represent poets from around the world who may have been unable to attend under normal circumstances. Mr. Sankar cited the example of Meera Dasgupta, a 16-year-old girl born and raised in America, who is the 2020 Youth Poet Laureate of the United States. Rajiv Mohabir, a powerful voice in America’s LGBTQ community, will be doing a reading of his work this year. “Of Guyanese Indian descent, Mohabir’s poetry is essentially trilingual. Though he writes in English, his mother tongue is Bhojpuri and having grown up as a Guyanese Indian, he speaks Guyanese Creole and his poetry reflects an Indian ethos,” he said. The Bengaluru Poetry Festival will be held on August 9 and can be viewed atwww.bengalurupoetry festival.org||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pandemic-prompts-bengaluru-poetry-festival-to-go-online/article32281361.ece

After her husband refused to cooperate, she is now being housed in a shelter. “We are getting calls from other States also, mostly from relatives who can’t come here to help their family memberss in distress and call us for help. Night counselling has also proven to be mainly for crisis intervention where we have even successfully prevented a suicide attempt. A woman whose husband fought with her left, taking their child with him. The woman called us and our counsellors were able to intervene in time and prevent her from doing anything drastic. They also patched up the family,” said Ms. Shetty. The night counselling team consists of three counsellors working in each of the three shifts between 5 p.m. and 10 a.m. Going by the demand, the new feature is here to stay beyond the pandemic, especially given that there are not many options available for those in distress to reach out to at night, she added.

06 August 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Pvt. hospitals asked to set aside 900 beds for COVID treatment||After consultations with private hospitals, the district administration hopes to set aside about 900 beds in the private sector for COVID treatment, while staff from the private sector is also likely to be roped in for COVID hospitals managed by the government. About 205 patients are admitted at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kalamassery, the only functioning COVID hospital in the district for tertiary care, which has the capacity to treat 300 patients. Of them, 184 patients remain positive, while most others are awaiting negative test results. While the number of patients requiring hospital care looks set to climb with the district recording over a 100 positive cases for four consecutive days, PVS Hospital, that can accommodate about 200 critically-ill patients, is still under maintenance, although work on making it operational began a few months ago. “About 800 to 900 beds will be set aside at around 10 private hospitals for seriously-ill patients. Private hospitals will have to support the system, and the COVID patient load will have to be spread out across a number of these hospitals, rather than converting just one or two into COVID facilities,” said Sub Collector Snehil Kumar Singh. The district programme management and supporting unit (DPMSU) set up to coordinate hospital, ambulance and FLTC related work, has decided that if a patient admitted at a private hospital tests positive for the virus, the hospital would have to treat them and not shift them to the MCH unless the patient is unable to afford treatment at a private hospital, he said. ‘Not legally binding’ “The strategy is that once the MCH and PVS Hospital reach 50% of their capacity, private hospitals will have to step in to ease the load. This has been communicated to all hospitals and the number of beds set aside at private hospitals is a dynamic number that could increase later,” he said. “We are negotiating with private hospitals and trying to prep them on the requirement that could arise. It is not legally binding on them to set aside a specific number of beds,” he said. Retaining a balance between COVID and non-COVID treatment facilities is crucial, he added. In an online briefing on Tuesday, District Collector S. Suhas had said that around 81 patients were currently being treated at private facilities. Official’s stance To convert PVS Hospital into a COVID hospital, staff was being sought from the private sector as well, a Health Department official associated with the process said. “Having designated COVID hospitals rather than taking COVID patients to private hospitals is necessary to prevent the infection from spreading to these other hospitals. Such a spread could cause a collapse of the healthcare system,” he said. “At PVS hospital, we are hoping to set up a system where private hospitals can spare a few nurses, attenders, and doctors, and continue to pay them, while the government offers some incentive,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pvt-hospitals-asked-to-set-aside-900-beds-for-covid-treatment/article32281670.ece

One person succumbed to the disease. The deceased was a 60-year-old native of Elamakkara who was being treated at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kalamassery. Suffering from diabetes and an infection, he had been admitted to the Ernakulam Medical Centre for treatment. When he showed symptoms of COVID-19, he was shifted to the MCH on July 29. His swab has been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Alappuzha, to confirm that it was a COVID-related death. The West Kochi area accounted for a bulk of the cases with 33 persons testing positive from Fort Kochi, Mattancherry and Palluruthy. Ten positive cases were recorded from the Nellikuzhi panchayat, besides four from Vengola and three persons from Eloor. Chellanam recorded only one positive case on Wednesday. Other positive patients were from Kothamangalam, Njarakkal, Nayarambalam, Perumbavoor, Kavalangad, Edathala, Thammanam and Cheranalloor. Three Navy personnel have also tested positive. A 27-year-old health worker at a private hospital in the district has been infected. The test result of an 87-year-old from Chellanam who had died of the disease earlier has returned positive, said a release. As many as 32 persons who arrived from outside the State, including 12 persons from West Bengal and 10 from Tamil Nadu, have tested positive. A total of 35 persons tested negative on Wednesday and 1,219 are being treated for the disease. For testing, 1,199 samples were sent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-let-up-in-infections-through-local-transmission-in-district/article32281672.ece
06 August 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Other treatments will be affected, say managements||Private hospitals in the district seem to grapple with the prospect of having to treat COVID-19 patients, with a few saying that other treatments they offer could prevent them from contributing more resources to the COVID fight. Praveen Kumar, Managing Director, Kinder Hospital, said that an eight-bed obstetric facility was being used for quarantined pregnant women. The hospital was in the process of setting aside 17 beds for COVID patients, he said. Rajagiri Hospital has set aside 25 beds for COVID treatment, where a few patients were already being treated. A spokesperson said that the protocol was still one of shifting patients to the Medical College Hospital if they tested positive during or before their treatment for other ailments, but patients could choose to receive treatment at the hospital itself. Both Lakshmi Hospital and Specialists’ Hospital said that their facilities would struggle to accommodate COVID patients. Lakshmi Hospital has set aside 15 beds in a regular ward, but considering the number of other high-risk patients and patients visiting the hospital for its gynaecology department, the hospital is hoping they won’t have to take in COVID patients unless absolutely necessary, said Ambili Arun, the hospital’s infection control and nursing manager. At Lisie Hospital, 20 beds have been set aside in an isolation ward for COVID patients. A separate area has been set aside at Aster Medcity for COVID patients, but the hospital was not willing to specify the number of beds. The Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences had set up a separate 32-bed hospital at Njarakkal. VPS Lakeshore had set aside one floor of the hospital with about five rooms. Dr. Vinod Franklin, who is in charge of infection control at the Ernakulam Medical Centre (EMC), said that the hospital had set aside 11 private rooms so far to accommodate suspected COVID-19 patients. Two ICU beds have also been set aside. On whether private hospitals would be able to spare staff for duty at government COVID hospitals, Mr. Praveen Kumar said that situation would be tricky since their specialists would be required for other treatments at their own hospitals. Dr. Franklin also pointed out that it could be difficult for the EMC to spare staff members considering that the existing staff was already working in two layers to avoid infection. “There are about 200 private hospitals in the State that have expressed willingness to treat COVID patients, but the understanding is that these hospitals will step up only once government facilities are saturated,” said Dr. Joseph Benaven, general secretary, Kerala Private Hospitals’ Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/other-treatments-will-be-affected-say-managements/article32281674.ece
06 August 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Panchayat asked to revoke building permit for WTE plant||The government has cancelled the order directing the Kochi Corporation to convert the concession agreement executed with G.J. Ecopower Ltd. into a lease agreement for the proposed waste-to-energy plant at Brahmapuram here. An order issued by the Department of Local-Self Government on August 3 has directed the Secretary of Vadavucode-Puthencruz panchayat (where the Brahmapuram land is located) to consider cancelling the building permit issued to the Director of G.J. Ecopower Pvt. Ltd for the project and take follow-up action as per the rules prescribed. The approval granted to the G.J. Nature Care consortium for the project at the civic body’s land in Brahmapuram was cancelled by the government on April 30, 2020. The government had stated that the consortium had failed to achieve the financial closure of the project even after 1,400 days of signing of the agreement. The government had approved the waste-to-energy project submitted by G.J Nature Care consortium at a cost of Rs. 295 crore on January 4, 2016. The corporation and the firm had executed a concession agreement for implementing the project on Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer (DBFOT) basis on February 17, 2016. A meeting of the State Level Advisory Committee on Waste Management held on December 12, 2018 had given its nod to convert the concession agreement executed between the corporation and the firm into a lease agreement. A senior official of the G.J. Eco Power Ltd. on Wednesday termed the government decision to cancel approval for the project and agreement with the Kochi Corporation as ‘unfair’. “The latest order is part of the vindictive measures being taken against us as the case filed by us against the government decision is slated for hearing at the Bench of the Chief Justice in the Kerala High Court on Friday,” he alleged.  The Hindu had reported on July 19, 2020 that 10 firms had evinced interest in the centralised waste-to-energy plant of 300 tonnes per day capacity after the government entrusted the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) to issue fresh tenders for the project. The firm to be chosen for the execution of the centralised plant at 20 acres in Brahmapuram will enjoy the rights to mortgage the leasehold rights on the 20-acres at Brahmapuram for raising funds for the project. The Secretary, Kochi Corporation, has been asked to hand over the 20 acres to the KSIDC on a lease basis. The government agency will sub-lease the land to the firm for 27 years, with permission to mortgage the leasehold rights on the land for raising funds for the project only.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/panchayat-asked-to-revoke-building-permit-for-wte-plant/article32281668.ece

Justice A. Muhammed Mustaque had earlier directed the government to issue such an order to prevent conversion and constructions on assigned agricultural land, when a case filed by an assignee against the denial of possessions certificate came up for hearing. Within a week The court also ordered the Revenue Principal Secretary to issue within a week a directive to all revenue authorities in the State to mention in the possession certificate the purpose for which the land was assigned. The court observed that such an endorsement of the revenue authorities on the certificate would enable local bodies to refuse building permits for construction on the land assigned for specific purposes such as agriculture.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-raps-govt-for-delay-in-issuing-order/article32281691.ece

06 August 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Bypassing safety norms leaves treasury exposed||Bureaucratic reluctance in adopting a management protocol, including dynamic password and biometric access, prescribed for insulating the online treasury management platform from fraudulent practices is reported to have rendered it vulnerable. Finance Department sources told The Hindu that while envisaging the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) since 2007-08 successive Secretaries who oversaw the project execution have mooted adequate precautions to plug all loopholes. The online treasury management system that handles around 10 lakh transactions a month is just one of the components of the IFMS. Since the Secretaries are burdened with too many responsibilities, micro-managing the system is not easy for them either. This lacuna offers the officials down the line sufficient leeway to function at will. New system On switching over to the new system, directives given for having a biometric system for users, dynamic password and multi-layer management that are integral to ensuring the security of the system, software and network were not complied in the strict sense. The entire system is said to be operating without a clear manual and principles. Dynamic password, the system of changing the password periodically, is a major deterrent to check irregularities, but it has not been not experimented. Even retired officials retain their password and mail ID and hence have the convenience to manipulate the data and payments without any hassles. While the password of the Service and Payroll Administrative Repository of Kerala (SPARK), a database of the employees, is being periodically changed, this has not yet been attempted at the treasury that transacts substantial sums. Crucial functions All crucial functions related to the system management are being directly controlled and monitored by the treasury director. A discreet delegation of privileges to key officials at different levels, including senior accountants who function as district coordinators of the system, would have eased his burden and helped to check irregularities. The problem is not endemic to the treasury alone, it could happen in any financial institutions, including banks, that do not resort to such safeguards, the sources said. Time has come to review whether the present software solution provider has the capacity to meet all the current demands and taller challenges when more transactions are routed through the treasury in future, they said.  Secretaries are burdened with too many responsibilities, micro-managing the system is not easy for them either.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bypassing-safety-norms-leaves-treasury-exposed/article32281695.ece
06 August 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Police to aid, not replace, health staff: CM||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday defended his decision to deploy the police to aid frontl-ine health workers to combat the COVID-19 pandemic better. He attacked the United Democratic Front (UDF) for accusing the government of having imposed a ‘police raj’ in Kerala. Without mentioning the UDF by name, Mr. Vijayan said some persons had a “peculiar mindset.” “They want the civil defence against the virus to collapse. They have repeatedly schemed for such a disastrous outcome. They give no value to the sacrifices of those on the front line of the battle against the pandemic. They have no care for the risk the public faces daily. They have no constructive criticism to offer. They just spread false tales. In time, they will slump under the weight of their lies,” he said. Police duties Mr. Vijayan said the police would enforce the rules on wearing masks and physical distancing stringently. They would check on households in quarantine. They would deploy their investigative expertise and technical prowess to trace primary and secondary contacts of infected persons. He said the Indian Medical Association (IMA) had wrongly assumed that the police would usurp the functioning of the medical fraternity. “That is not the case. They would bolster the efforts of health workers not supplant them,” he said. Mr. Vijayan said the police were empowered to take steps to prevent the spread of the disease. “Make no mistake. The police have the legal authority to prevent activities that could escalate the transmission of the virus. We need to curtail all activities that might contribute to the spread of the disease,” he said. He also brushed aside accusations that his decision to throw the law enforcement in the vanguard of the battle against COVID-19 had caused disgruntlement in the force. The police had assigned a sub-inspector in all station houses to track the disease transmission pattern. Motorcycle brigades would patrol containment localities relentlessly. The police had intensified checking of vehicles. Kerala had curbed the spread of the virus better than many developed nations. However, the Opposition appeared intent on tarnishing its image.  The police have the legal authority to prevent activities that can escalate virus transmission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-to-aid-not-replace-health-staff-cm/article32281681.ece
06 August 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Capital tally is 274 cases||The daily COVID-19 caseload in the district remained high on Wednesday also with 274 new cases being reported. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has indicated the need for heightened vigil in parts of the district that could witness a spurt in cases. Of Wednesday’s caseload, infection through contact accounted for 250 cases, according to statistics released on Wednesday evening. The source of infection remained uncertain in 14 cases. As many as 528 people tested negative. Looming risk There is a possibility of the limited COVID-19 clusters in Kallikkadu, Vellarada, and Neyattinkara municipality expanding into large community clusters, the Chief Minister said. Preventive measures had been strengthened in all the three places, he said. Anchuthengu reported 35 cases on Wednesday while 20 people tested positive in Poovar. Parassala reported 12 cases, while ten people each tested positive at Karode and Vallakkadavu. Nine Tamil Nadu natives also tested positive for the virus on Wednesday in the district. Continued caution Although the pace of disease transmission has slowed down in Poonthura and Vizhinjam, both coastal areas are yet to exit the danger zone, according to the Chief Minister. Of the 2,011 tests conducted in the large community clusters in the district, 203 had returned positive. Meanwhile, 2,101 people were placed under disease surveillance on Wednesday, even as 1,898 others completed the observation period without developing symptoms. As on Wednesday, 18,040 people are under surveillance in the district. Of this, 14,344 people are in home quarantine while 2,884 people are hospitalised. COVID care centres accommodate 812 people. For ensuring prompt services to patients, the district administration has allotted five additional ambulances to each taluk. More ambulances would be deployed if needed, the administration said. District Collector Navjot Khosa convened a meeting of the transportation and ambulance teams on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the government has decided to step up monitoring of COVID-19 regulations in areas outside containment zones. The Thiruvananthapuram district panchayat has handed over 5,000 PPE kits and 5,000 antigen test kits to health workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/capital-tally-is-274-cases/article32281716.ece
06 August 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Transfers in AAI upset personnel||Executive personnel in various wings of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) at the Thiruvananthapuram international airport are being transferred amidst the pandemic-induced lockdown and despite an order not to transfer employees in view of the ongoing privatisation. Over 20 executives working in the electric, civil, motor transport, CNS, and other wings at the airport have got transfer orders to Agartala, and Arunchal Pradesh and the upcoming airport projects in Bihar and Agatti. Many of the transfers are to remote stations and places considered as unpopular. Those transferred have been asked to report for duty by August 10. The transfer orders have come amidst the lockdown, closure of educational institutions, and non-availability of transit accommodation. The trade unions and associations have requested the AAI to avoid the general transfers in view of the prevailing conditions and the spurt in COVID-19 cases. “Besides upsetting the family and education of the children, the AAI will have to spend Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 3 lakh for each employee towards TA and DA alone. In all, 500 people had been transferred and this would be a huge liability,” an AAI trade union leader said. Final stage The orders had been issued when the management had not even considered request transfers, he said. It was also a clear violation of the directive not to transfer employees as privatisation was in the final stage, he said. The posts of Assistant General Manager (AGM), Deputy General Manager, and Head of Department are remaining vacant in various wings of the AAI. “When three AGMs were transferred from the electrical wing, one assistant manager was posted. No effort is made to fill the vacant posts,” says an AAI employee “We are not against these transfers. But the prevailing situation should be considered. Securing accommodation will be a headache in these testing times. The transfers should be kept pending for six months,” one of the aggrieved employees said. AAI stance A top AAI official said the transfers were inevitable and had been limited to the barest minimum and added that all factors, including privatisation, were taken into account.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/transfers-in-aai-upset-personnel/article32281707.ece
06 August 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Heavy rain forecast for Kozhikode, Wayanad districts||Kozhikode and Wayanad are likely to receive extremely heavy rainfall on Thursday, according to an India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast. Red alerts have been issued for both districts. The forecast indicates that both districts may receive above 20.4 cm rainfall in a 24-hour period. With the low pressure area over north Bay of Bengal becoming a well-marked low over the northwest part of the Bay, southwest monsoon has entered an active phase over Kerala. The State can expect very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall till August 9 (Sunday), the IMD said. Orange alerts have been issued for Ernakulam, Idukki, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur, and Kasaragod till August 9. Orange alerts have also been issued for Pathanamthitta and Kottayam for Saturday. These districts are likely to receive heavy to very heavy rain on said days. Squally weather is likely to prevail along the coasts of Keraka, Karnataka, Goa and the Lakshadweep region till August 9. Two deaths Torrential rain and strong winds in the past two days have left a trail of destruction in parts of the Malabar region. The southwest monsoon claimed the lives of two children in separate incidents in Wayanad district. Meanwhile, two more teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) are expected to arrive in Kerala this week. The new teams will be deployed in Palakkad and Malappuram. With their arrival, the number of NDRF teams deployed in Kerala would go up to six. People residing in landslip-prone regions where red alerts have been issued will be evacuated in view of the IMD forecast that monsoon rainfall could strengthen over Kerala, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Wednesday. Extremely heavy rainfall in the Nilgiri hills would increase the chances of calamities in Wayanad, eastern parts of Malappuram district and the northeastern parts of Palakkad. A similar situation in Idukki would also affect Ernakulam district, he said. The water levels in major dams have not increased significantly. Nevertheless, reservoir and river water levels are being closely monitored. The level is close to warning levels only in the Manimalayar at the moment. Water is being discharged from the Peringalkuthu, Kallarkutty and Lower Periyar dams of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) and a number of dams managed by the Irrigation Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/heavy-rain-forecast-for-kozhikode-wayanad-districts/article32281697.ece
06 August 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Special team for COVID data analytics||The Local Self-Government Department (LSGD) has constituted an expert data management team to analyse the vast amounts of data from across the State on the COVID-19 pandemic-related activities being carried out by local bodies to prioritise effective intervention. Right from the early stages, local bodies have anchored the State’s COVID-19 resistance activities on the ground, from managing quarantining at home and in institutions to running of community kitchens to the running of COVID first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) now. Handling and analysing effectively the data regarding all this can be a tough ask. The data management team, consisting of researchers and faculty from the Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA), has been constituted to focus on this task. Making projections Sarada Muralidharan, Principal Secretary, Local Self-Government, told The Hindu that the data analytics team will help the department make projections and flag things that need to be paid attention to. “At any point in time, we have at our disposal more than 5,000 data points which we need to look through. It is convenient if we have a dedicated system. The Information Kerala Mission has been handling all the data, but their primary responsibility is management of software and report generation. When the nature of the spread is getting slightly alarming, we need to be very clear about what is happening everywhere, identify specific trouble spots and to make arrangements,” said Ms.Muralidharan. She said this number crunching had to be done on a daily basis as the situation, from containment zones to clusters was changing daily. Cross-checking The primary responsibilities of the data management team include collection and consolidation of all reports related to COVID-19 from the local level. They also do error rectification in reports by validation and cross-checking of suspicious figures or cases of not reporting. The team has to identify lags in specific local bodies in the setting up of FLTCs or other facilities or in making all necessary arrangements in these facilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/special-team-for-covid-data-analytics/article32281686.ece
06 August 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Curbs on visas hit NoRK families||The curbs on tourist visas and visit visas for Indians who want to go to the United Arab Emirates have come as a big setback for hundreds of Non-Resident Keralites (NoRKs) as their relatives in Kerala will not be able to visit the seven emirates. The restrictions by the Centre are despite granting permission to Indian and UAE nationals having resident visas and fresh job visas and student visas to travel on flights operated by the Air India Group, Air India Express and charter flights to the UAE as per an agreement reached by the two governments. With COVID-19 situation improving in the UAE, the General Directorate of Residency and Foreign Affairs (GDRFA) in Dubai has started issuing new visit visas for Indians. Tourists can apply for visas in advance or get visa stamped on arrival if they hold a passport from one of 70 countries as per the pre-pandemic norms. But, the Centre’s curbs on visit and tourist visas have deprived families of NoRKs a chance to visit the emirates during Onam vacation. “There is uncertainty about our travel to the UAE during the forthcoming holidays. Airlines say they cannot fly those with tourist and visit visas and transit passengers beyond the UAE. Why can’t the government relax the curbs,” says a Thiruvananthapuram-based woman who is planning to visit her husband in Dubai. An official of an airline operating to Dubai said they were getting several calls daily from the NoRKs and there was heavy demand from those proceeding to the UAE with tourist and visit visas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/curbs-on-visas-hit-nork-families/article32281678.ece
06 August 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||New plant species gets a pioneer’s name||A new plant species of the genus Ardisia spotted in the biodiversity-rich Western Ghats has been named after an early 20th century botanist who helped expand the knowledge on Indian flora. Scientists at the Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute (JNTBGRI) at Palode here encountered the new species in the Akkamalai forest within the Anamalai Tiger Reserve in Tamil Nadu recently. They have named it Ardisia ramaswamii after M.S. Ramaswami, who, with C.C. Calder and V. Narayanaswami, listed species not mentioned in J.D. Hooker’s Flora of British India.   Ardisia ramaswamii (family Primulaceae) is a small tree which grows to a height of about six metres. The finding by JNTBGRI scientists Nazarudeen Ahammed, G. Rajkumar and R. Prakashkumar, Director, JNTBGRI, is published in the July edition of Annals of Plant Sciences . “The genus Ardisia has around 500 species of shrubs and trees worldwide, of which 400 are found in Asia. With the addition of the new species, the number of species found in India has risen to 29 with 16 in the Western Ghats alone,” Dr. Nazarudeen said. The JNTBGRI team had literally stumbled upon the species while researching Kurinji species in the thick evergreen forest region. Medicinal properties Since many related species of Ardisia possess medicinal properties, the discovery is significant from a health-care perspective. For instance, Ardisia elliptica , known locally as ‘kili njaval’ or ‘sugar njaval,’ is good for making wine and valued for treating diabetes. Another cousin, Ardisia solanacea , (manimundakkizhangu), is used in traditional healing systems. “Whether Ardisia ramaswamii has medicinal value needs to be ascertained,” Dr. Nazarudeen said. The identification is important from the conservationist’s point of view as well. Recently, the same team identified two other Ardisia species — Ardisia nayarii and Ardisia agasthyamalayana — from the Kerala side of the Western Ghats. Bio-physical pressures and possible habitat degradation threaten all three species. In fact, Ardisia ramaswamii itself has a low population and is localised in distribution. “That is why they get qualified to be included on the ‘red list’ category of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, demanding urgent conservation initiatives,” the JNTBGRI said. “Anamalai hills, the area of distribution of the new species, can be marked as a refugium of relict biota and becomes one of the ‘hottest of the hotspots’ in the world,” according to the institute.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-plant-species-gets-a-pioneers-name/article32281714.ece

Director General of Police Tomin J. Thachankery said the agency had secured their custody from Thrissur. The Crime Branch would seek their custody for questioning. It identified the arrested persons as Jasmin Shaw, president of the UNA; Shobi Joseph, State president; and Nithin Mohan and Jithu P.D., both UNA staff. Fissures within The Crime Branch declared the accused as fugitives from the law in 2019 and promulgated lookout notices for them. The agency has now booked them for criminal breach of trust, forgery, cheating, conspiracy, and theft. Fissures in the organisation led to the case. The Crime Branch initiated a probe based on a complaint filed by Sibi Mukesh, vice president of the UNA. He alleged that the accused had diverted UNA funds for personal use. In the process, they denied financial assistance to nurses who lost their jobs while agitating for reasonable wages. The Crime Branch was also investigating Shaw’s wife, Shabna, in connection with the fraud.

Markfed, the Tobacco Board has postponed the fixation of crop size of the Flue Cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco for the year 2020-2021 to August 18. The Tobacco Board, which held its 151st meeting on Wednesday with an agenda to fix the crop size, decided to postpone the meeting. Markfed intervention It is learnt that the State government will now actively intervene in the trade and ensure a level-playing field between the farmers and the traders. The annual crop size for the year 2019-2020 was 136 million kg. But this year’s auctions remained volatile. The impact of COVID-19 was felt severely, and major tobacco companies refused to give a better price to low and medium grade varieties, forcing the State government to intervene and press Markfed to procure the produce. Sources in the government said that leading tobacco companies had been giving far lesser prices to the farmers for many years, forcing the government’s intervention. With the State government now intervening actively, there will be a better trade off for the farmers, it is learnt. The distress was evident in the year 2015 when the farmers in the SLS and SBS regions in Prakasam district had committed suicide, forcing the Central government to intervene. The board also discussed in detail the requests of the growers and grower representatives, indents given by the manufacturers and exporters through the Indian Tobacco Association (ITA), past export and domestic trends, global supply and demand scenario, and the effect of COVID-19. Member of Parliament Bandi Sanjay Kumar, Special Chief Secretary, Agriculture, Poonam Malakondaiah, Executive Director, ITC, R. Muthuraj, Director, CTRI, D. Damodar Reddy, Director, Department of Commerce, Neetika Bansai, and trade representatives from the ITA were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tobacco-board-defers-decision-on-crop-size-to-august-18/article32281809.ece

06 August 2020||KAKINADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Suspending general services will affect poor’||Former Kakinada city MLA Vanamadi Venkateswara Rao on Wednesday appealed to the State government to continue to offer general and mother and child care services at the Government General Hospital (GGH). The TDP leader’s appeal comes in response to the decision that the treatment for patients with non-COVID ailments would be suspended with effect from August 6 at the GGH as it was now designated as the COVID critical care hospital in the district. ‘Delay in treatment’ The general patients have been urged to visit the private hospitals for treatment under the Arogyasri scheme until further orders. However, the senior TDP leader pointed out that getting admission to the private hospitals under the scheme would lead to delay in the treatment. Speaking to mediapersons here, Mr. Venkateswara Rao said: “The district authorities should understand the problems of patients suffering from other ailments too. Many people, from other districts as well, prefer to get admitted to the GGH-Kakinada for mother and child care services. Suspending them will affect the poor.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/suspending-general-services-will-affect-poor/article32281797.ece

06 August 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Flower market loses its fragrance||‘Sravana maasam’, an auspicious month in the Telugu calendar, did not bring cheers to traders and commission agents at the wholesale flower market here. The prices of flowers have increased, but not much as they used to be in the past. Moreover, there is no hectic activity which is generally seen during this period. The flowers such as chrysanthemum, which are considered a must during the Varalakshmi puja, have become a rare commodity. Similarly, southern wood (davanam) and sweet marjoram (maruvam) are not seen in the market. According to information, several varieties, including roses, are being imported from Bengaluru on a daily basis, while jasmine and winter jasmine (jaji) are from local markets. But, the arrivals have come down drastically. Each trader used to sell not less than 1,000 kg of flowers a day. Now, it has come down to 400 kg to 600 kg a day. Similarly, the arrivals of jasmine (malle) and firecracker (kanakambaram) have come down. Not more than 100 to 150 kg of jasmine is being sold every day in the market. Only one or two traders are able to get little over 10 kg of firecrackers each day. The firecrackers are sold at Rs. 600 a kg on Wednesday. No supply Vendors like Khwaja say there are no supplies of ‘davanam’ and ‘maruvam’ from Chennai for more than a month. There is no possibility of supply of these varieties this season. As an alternative, green foliage, which has no aroma is being used in garlands, he says. S. Appa Rao, a vendor who usually sells hybrid roses and varieties like star, has switched to Persian roses (’desi gulabi’/ ‘naatu gulabi’). ‘Naatu gulabi’, supplied by farmers from nearby villages in Guntur district, is sold at Rs. 80 a kg. A month ago, the Persian roses were sold at as low as Rs. 40 a kg. It is not possible to invest on hybrid roses and wind up sales by noon. So, ‘naatu gulabi’ is being sold, he says. The prices of the ‘kagada malle’ have doubled and sold at Rs. 400 a kg. The chrysanthemum is sold at Rs. 320 a kg. The winter jasmine is sold at Rs. 80 a kg.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/flower-market-loses-its-fragrance/article32281319.ece
06 August 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Capital: Naidu seeks Modi’s intervention||In an apparent bid to put the onus on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Union government regarding the Amaravati issue, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has underscored the need for the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in resolving the three Capitals issue. Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, TDP national president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu said that Mr. Modi should resolve the Amaravati row like he solved the decades-old Ayodhya problem. Hailing Mr. Modi for laying a foundation stone for the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, Mr. Naidu said it was a lasting solution for a long-pending issue that marked nation-wide ‘kar sevas’ and ‘rath yatras’. Just like how sacred soil was brought from 2,000 shrines and purified water brought from 100 rivers for Ayodhya foundation, sacred soil and water was brought from 171 shrines and 35 rivers for Amaravati Capital foundation. Mr. Modi himself fetched soil from Parliament and water from the Yamuna when he laid the foundation stone for Amaravati, he recalled. The Centre cautioned the State government several times on the cancellation of PPEs relating to global solar companies. Those investors’ problems were finally solved with the intervention of the Centre and with the orders of the courts, he said. In respect of Amaravati also, the MoUs were signed with 29,000 farmers who gave away 33,000 acres of their ancestral lands for constructing Capital for all five crore people. ‘Protect farmers’ rights’ The Centre had to protect the rights and future of these farmers as well as the whole State, Mr. Naidu said, adding, “Parliament was witness to how Mr. Modi held out an assurance to the five crore people of A.P. that the Central Government would do everything possible to develop Amaravati into a great Capital city.” Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had not responded to the demand to withdraw the Capital shifting decision or go for fresh elections as a referendum. “The ruling YSRCP leaders ran away from our challenge. This Chief Minister says he comes from a family that stands by its word and never breaks promises. Now, his actions show that his government has no credibility. The Chief Minister has no authority to change State Capital as per his whims and fancies,” Mr. Naidu added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/capital-naidu-seeks-modis-intervention/article32281814.ece

So far, 1.63 lakh medical consultations have been taken up and a majority of them are related to diabetes and hypertension. The entire initiative has been more useful for women as among the beneficiaries they account for 55%. “With the imposition of lockdown, clinics had to be closed. But telemedicine assistance and nurses representing the clinics have enabled us to stay in touch with the beneficiaries. When required they have been connected to doctors who offered timely advice. When the clinics were opened we had good footfall,” Tata Trusts public health consultant Turlapati Narsimhaprasad said. Awareness drive Dr. Narsimhaprasad said that the initiative has helped early detection of Non-Communicable Diseases among thousands of persons in the region and also many were encouraged to walk in and avail of healthcare services without any hesitation due to its approach. Continuous health awareness programmes in addition to the health camps have helped a lot, he said. Under the hub and spoke model, eight doctors at the consultation hub and 45 paramedical staff, including nurse practitioners and a mobile medical unit (MMU) supported by modern diagnostics unit, have been serving in the area. A majority of the beneficiaries are in the age group of 26-60 years who are at the risk of having non-communicable diseases. Also, 21% of the beneficiaries are of the above 60 years age group.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-healthy-initiative-in-pandemic-times/article32281803.ece

Addressing the media in Hyderabad on Wednesday, Ms. Sucharita said the Leader of the Opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu, who had insulted the Dalit community earlier, was trying to blame the government in some incidents. She dared the Telugu Desam MLAs to resign to their posts before criticising the government on the capital issue. What Mr. Naidu had done when former Minister Adinarayana Reddy and former chief whip Chintamaneni Prabhakar insulted Dalits, she questioned, and clarified that the government responded promptly and suspended Kasibugga CI who allegedly kicked a Dalit person with leg. The government acted swiftly with regard to the incidents reported in East Godavari and Prakasam districts and took action against the officers, she claimed. Stating that friendly policing was being implemented in Andhra Pradesh, the Home Minister said that dowry deaths and other crimes have come down in the State, and asked the police to maintain restraint.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sucharita-slams-tdp-for-remarks-against-state-govt/article32281324.ece

It was stated that the Central PCB had identified 351 river stretches as polluted for not meeting the prescribed water quality standards. The five river stretches in A.P. were found to have exceeded the standard limit of 3 mg / litre of biochemical oxygen demand. The reason for pollution is the discharge of untreated sewage into the rivers in Rajamahendravaram, Vijayawada, Tadepalli, Srikakulam, Kurnool and Nandyal. The sewage generation from these six municipalities / corporations is about 457 MLD, whereas the existing treatment capacity is only 161 MLD.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/stps-to-be-set-up-for-treating-polluted-river-stretches/article32281815.ece
06 August 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Unlock 3.0: Gyms reopen on a cautious note in city||Gymnasiums in the city reopened to a tepid response on Wednesday after being shut for over four months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Central Government gave its nod for the reopening of gyms and yoga institutes in Unlock 3.0, few patrons turned up on the first day as coronavirus cases continue to be on a steep climb in the city. A patron who visited a gym on Wednesday said that while he was eagerly waiting to resume working out, it was not entirely an enjoyable experience. “Today was very unusual for those of us who visited the gym after a four-month gap. We were strictly told to not interact with anyone and maintain a safe distance from each other. After using any equipment, we were told to wipe it carefully with a cloth and put everything back in its place,” said B.J.V. Mahesh, a resident of Murali Nagar. Gym owners, meanwhile, say that they are putting in place all safety measures in order to provide visitors a safe ambience. Gym trainers have instructed their members on what precautions to be taken before coming, while a few gyms have issued slots to their patrons in order to avoid overcrowding. K. Ganesh, a member of the Visakha Gym Owners Welfare Association, said that out of 130 gyms in their association, most of them are now open except for those in containment zones. “We saw a low turnout on the first day. The association has made gym gloves, masks, and sweat wear compulsory. We are also checking the body temperature of visitors before allowing them entry,” he said. “We are maintaining a register so that we can alert any member not to come if they are residents of hotspots. We expect an increase in turnout gradually after the members see our safety measures,” he said. Yoga institutes Officials from the Department of Yoga and Consciousness (Yoga Village) Andhra University are also gearing up to start public classes soon. “Generally, our classrooms accommodate 50 people. But due to the COVID-19 scare, we have decided to take only 20 people. For this, we need to increase the number of batches. Arrangements are going on,” said K. Ramesh Babu, Head of the Department of Yoga & Consciousness. Online yoga classes introduced by the department have been getting a good response. Varsity authorities said that in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of people turning towards yoga has increased. “A group of 53 persons are practising ‘pranayama’ and 20 persons are taking general yoga classes. A special class is being run for women from 10 a.m. in which a good number are taking part. Pranayama techniques that will improve lung health are being practiced,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/unlock-30-gyms-reopen-on-a-cautious-note-in-city/article32281973.ece
06 August 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Coronavirus figures are not adding up, claims TDP MLA||Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader and MLA Velagapudi Ramakrishna Babu on Wednesday alleged that there was a mismatch between the number of COVID-19 positive cases and the death toll being reported in Visakhapatnam district. Addressing reporters here on Wednesday, the TDP leader said that while Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao was saying that 119 patients had died at VIMS Hospital, the officials were declaring the number of deaths to be 106. The number of persons who had died due to lack of medical care must be over 100. Similarly, there was a difference in the number of COVID-19 deaths shown in the State bulletin, he alleged. “I had said in the past that irregularities were being committed in the declaration of deaths. The Minister admitted during his visits to VIMS Hospital that there was a shortage of staff at the hospital,” the MLA claimed. “The previous government had issued a G.O. for 870 posts but the present government did not bother recruiting staff. The situation would have been different had the present government implemented the G.O.,” he alleged, adding that basic amenities were unavailable for patients at the Government Chest Hospital. “Even drinking water is not available at COVID Hospitals in the district,” he said. A number of patients were being taken to COVID Hospitals in violation of the protocol. Pregnant women were facing problems and kits were not being given to those in home quarantine in Visakhapatnam district unlike in neighbouring districts, Mr. Ramakrishna Babu said, urging Mr. Srinivasa Rao to look into these issues. The MLA alleged that the menu for COVID-19 patients was not being implemented at any of the quarantine centres. Land should be identified on the outskirts of the city to cremate those who succumb to COVID-19, he said, seeking more ventilator facilities and starting of a CSR Block at KGH. The TDP MLA wondered what was stopping the State government from permitting clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine in KGH, when the Centre had permitted the same.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/coronavirus-figures-are-not-adding-up-claims-tdp-mla/article32281971.ece

06 August 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||VCCI urges govt. to not revise land rates in view of pandemic||The Vizagapatam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) has appealed to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy not to go for an upward revision of land rates in view of the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Referring to the proposal of the government for an upward revision of the value of land in the State and calling for objections, if any, VCCI president Veera Mohan and honorary secretary Ravi Godey told reporters here on Wednesday that the present government value of lands in Visakhapatnam was very high and at par with market value. In some areas, the government value was much higher than the prevailing market value, they said. “Housing is one of the basic needs of citizens. Land cost is a major component in the housing sector. The increase of land rate in government records would lead to an increase in the prices of house sites, houses, flats and agriculture lands. Any increase in rates by the government will finally reflect in the end costs on the common man,” Mr. Veera Mohan said. “The proposed increase will deter potential buyers, especially the middle and lower-middle class people, from buying a plot or flat. The decrease in purchasing power will have a cascading effect and adversely affect the real estate and construction sector. It will ultimately have an impact on the revenue of the government,” Mr. Ravi said. Andhra Pradesh is one of the few States in India that has been upwardly revising land rates every year from 2015 to 2019. In these five years, government land rates have doubled. The VCCI representatives appealed to Mr. Jagan not to tax the people in these difficult times. They noted that in neighbouring Telangana, the land rates were fixed in 2013 and Karnataka has announced that there would not be any increase till 2021, and was also initiating measures to reduce the values by 5% to 10%. Tamil Nadu was offering stamp duty exemption on apartments and had reduced guidance value by 33% in 2017. The VCCI reiterated its appeal not to increase land rates at least for this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vcci-urges-govt-to-not-revise-land-rates-in-view-of-pandemic/article32281968.ece

Photographers from across the country— professional and amateurs —are showcasing their works at the exhibition being conducted to mark August as the world photography month. “The pandemic has been hard on photographers, especially those specialising in landscape, nature and wildlife. This is a platform for everyone to showcase the best images from their portfolios,” says Subrahmanyam Kotipalli of Vivid Photography. The group has opened its first online exhibition for photographers across the country. Each photographer can submit up to five images under categories such as wildlife, landscape, tabletop and food, portrait and fashion, sports and action, travel, fine arts, weddings and events. “The pandemic has significantly impacted travel and landscape photography. Every year, I attend at least three to four travel photography workshops and document critical habitats of Olive Ridleys and migratory birds. But all plans are shelved this time. I am utilising the time to learn about other photography software and pulling out old images of the city from my stock for online exhibition,” says veteran photographer K. Bhaskar Rao. Mr. Rao had captured several heritage spots and structures of Visakhapatnam region, including those that no longer exist. He has submitted a series on his recent Bhutan travel for the exhibition.

The Hindu could not access the full text of this draft but a note by Ms. Menon says: “The Company’s case is at present being considered by the Violation EAC in the ministry. In view of the magnitude of the accident and the clear responsibility of the company, directions to the company for closure under Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act is placed alongside for approval.” A decision on the matter was to be taken by the Secretary C.K. Mishra. He was due to retire on May 31 and left the decision to “his successor”, records of the meeting show. The matter then landed on the table of R.P. Gupta, the incumbent. However, on June 18, another officer of the Ministry noted that the matter was “discussed” with the Secretary (Mr. Gupta) and the final decision was to only seek a status report on the compliance with the MSIHC Rules. The reason proferred was that the APPCB had withdrawn the unit’s “consent to operate” and that the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which had imposed a Rs. 50 crore fine, was overseeing the process. “In view of the above, it is noted that the objectives desired through the set of proposed directions under Section 5 are already addressed by the actions initiated by APPCB and Hon’ble NGT. Therefore, Ministry may proceed only with the aspect of seeking status of compliance of MSIHC Rules,” according to the file-notings. “It’s clear that the Environment Ministry, even though it has the necessary powers, doesn’t want to involve itself in shutting down the company,” Mr. Tongad told The Hindu . On May 19, the MoEFCC-appointed ‘Violations Committee’ had deferred a decision on the company’s application on the grounds it would wait for final decisions by the NGT and other expert committees monitoring the aftermath of the industrial disaster.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ministry-dithers-on-decision-to-close-lg-polymers/article32281812.ece

The management has made arrangements for providing treatment to the infected employees at some of the major private hospitals in Hyderabad apart from ramping up screening and treatment services in its area hospitals across the State’s coal belt. Rapid antigen testing kits have also been made available at the main hospital in Kothagudem and the area hospitals elsewhere in various other areas of State. However, some of the major trade unions operating in the Singareni coal fields have been consistently demanding scaling up of testing facilities at the coal mine level and life insurance cover to the SCCL staff, including the entire workforce both regular and contract workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sccl-steps-up-measures-to-check-virus-spread-screening-ramped-up/article32281632.ece

06 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Sudden spike in three districts||The Health department has been keeping a close watch on the COVID-19 situation in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits, Rangareddy and Medchal, which have reported the maximum number of cases in Telangana. But, now three other districts — Warangal Urban, Karimnagar and Sangareddy — have also come into focus following a sharp spike in cases in the past week. Between July 29 and August 4, GHMC recorded 3,398 positive while Rangareddy and Medchal-Malkajgiri saw 1,285 and 1,019 persons testing positive for coronavirus, respectively. More tests In this same period, Warangal Urban reported 744 cases and Karimnagar trailed with 610 cases. Sangareddy was inching close to the 500-mark with 494 being diagnosed with the contagious infection. One of the reasons for the increase in cases detection in these districts is ramping up of testing. Rapid antigen tests are being conducted at Primary Health Centres and Community Health Centres. As more number of people suspected to have COVID-19 undergo tests, more cases are coming to the fore. Though the number of tests performed in a day, and cumulative number of tests are mentioned in media bulletin issued every day, the break-up of figures as per districts is not mentioned. The data would have been helpful to understand the Test Positivity Rate or the percentage of samples which test positive in each district, thereby indicating the extent of virus spread. For long, COVID-19 treatment was offered at government hospitals in Hyderabad. However, officials from Health department said they have started to admit COVID patients in district hospitals, area hospitals, and various government health facilities in other districts too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sudden-spike-in-three-districts/article32281598.ece
06 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||GHMC fed 1.3 cr.-plus during lockdown||Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation has provided more than 1.3 crore free meals to the poor and the destitute during the four months of lockdown period under the ‘Annapurna’ scheme, a statement from the corporation informed. A total of 83,25,624 persons were served meals during lunch time, and 47,42,538 persons were fed during dinner time, the statement informed. Initiated in 2014 by the then GHMC Commissioner and present Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, the ‘Annapurna’ scheme was designed to provide subsidised meals at Rs. 5 per plate during afternoon hours alone. Before lockdown, only about 35,000 meals were being provided per day. However, keeping in mind the travails of stranded and destitute persons during the COVID-19 lockdown which came into force since March 23, the scheme was extended to evening hours too, and made free for all. Apart from the poor and destitute persons, the scheme has provided lunch for even persons under home quarantine when requests for the same were received by the control room set up in GHMC headquarters. Starting from April 9 till now, over 15 lakh meals were provided through requests received by control room, the statement said. Petty vendors and their families who lost livelihoods owing to lockdown too availed themselves of the free meals, it said. During peak time of the lockdown period, the meals were served through 300 centres instead of the earlier 150, which included mobile Annapurna centres. Under the scheme, each person is provided 450 grams of rice, 100 grams of daal, sambar, curry and pickle, which make up one full meal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ghmc-fed-13-cr-plus-during-lockdown/article32281616.ece
06 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Pay compensation to TDF members: NHRC||National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has ordered compensation of Rs. 1 lakh each for several activists who have been wrongly charged by the Chhattisgarh Police and implicated in various cases. Delhi University professor Nandini Sundar and seven members of a fact finding team from Telangana Democratic Front (TDF) are among those granted the compensation. Prof. Sundar and others were charged with murder of a tribal person, while cases were slapped under provisions of the Chattisgarh Special Public Security Act against the TDF members when they tried to enter the State on a fact finding mission in December, 2016. Under-trials The team members had to spend several months in jail as under-trials before being granted bail, and later acquitted. Citing Chhattisgarh DGP’s testimony that the name of Prof. Sundar, along with those of Jawaharlal Nehru University professor Archana Prasad, Vineet Tiwari from Delhi’s Joshi Adhikar Sansthan, and Chhattisgarh Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Sanjay Parate, and two others Manju and Mangla Ram Karma have been removed from the FIR as no evidence was found against them, the NHRC order noted that the persons must have suffered great mental pain and agony as a result of the false FIRs. It was a violation of their human rights, and the State government should compensate them, the order said. With regard to the seven members of fact finding team including Ch. Prabhakar, B. Durga Prasad, B. Ravindranath, D. Prabhakar, R. Lakshmaiah, Mohd. Nazir, and K. Rajendra Prasad, the Commission has noted that they had been acquitted of all charges by the chief judicial magistrate of Sukma. Observing that the false FIRs caused them mental trauma and agony, the order directed the Chhattisgarh State government to pay Rs. 1 lakh compensation to each of them.  No payment so far While the order dated March 13, 2020 said the compensation should be paid and proofs submitted within six weeks’ time, the duration has expired already with no payment so far. Lockdown restrictions imposed in the backdrop of COVID-19 spread have delayed the arrival of a copy of the order, the petitioners informed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/pay-compensation-to-tdf-members-nhrc/article32281636.ece
06 August 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Helping their ‘favourite Sir’ tide over difficult times||Guru Dakshina manifested in a contemporary setting in Jagtial district as a financially troubled teacher was paid back in grace by his former students. Hanumandla Raghu, a 52-year-old teacher at a private school, was stuck with no income and found himself low on cash reserves after his salary payment stopped from March, after the coronavirus pandemic broke out. Around 40 students whom Mr. Raghu taught 24 years ago in Rudrangi village (of erstwhile Karimnagar district, now Rajanna-Sircilla) got together to help out their ‘favourite’ teacher. The students, who are now employed in Hyderabad, Bengaluru and other countries, pooled more than Rs. 1.20 lakh and helped Mr. Raghu, a father of three, set up a tiffin-cum-chicken centre at Ambaripeta village to survive this testing period of his life. The private school teacher, who never revealed about the critical financial condition to anybody, finally opened up when one of his students Gangam Gangareddy, MPTC from Kalikota, called to check on him. Soon after learning about the hardship faced by his favourite teacher, Mr. Gangareddy sent him a rice bag, and posted a message in his school friends’ WhatsApp group. “We teamed up and decided to help our teacher. My classmates (Class 10 batch of 1998) who are settled across the world started sending me money, but instead of giving cash, we decided to help him set up a business for steady income even after the pandemic,” Mr. Gangareddy said  . After getting permission from the local sarpanch for land, the MPTC asked his classmate Rajamallaiah, a blacksmith, to make a shed at minimal cost. “Later, he told our teacher to shift to Kalikota from Korutla town and on Sunday, the shop was inaugurated. Now, he doesn't have to worry about the source of income. It will pick up slowly,” Mr. Gangareddy said, adding that they also purchased a grinder, refrigerator and groceries, apart from other essential items to start the business. He said Mr. Raghu has a unique teaching style and would always make lessons interesting. “He is neither an opportunist nor greedy. Sir is a man of principles and was always happy with our achievements,” he said. The teacher was touched that his students still remember him. “I was not aware of their plan till the last week of July. They helped me set up a business during the most difficult time of my life and I cannot express my gratitude to my students in words,” Mr. Raghu, a teacher of English and Biology, said. Students of other batches, too, have started sending him money. So far, they pooled around Rs. 1.8 lakh, which can be used for the weddings of his two daughter, the teacher said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/helping-their-favourite-sir-tide-over-difficult-times/article32281603.ece
06 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Karimnagar land grabbing case: More skeletons to tumble out of closet?||Did the Revenue and Sub-Registrar officials of Karimnagar district play any role in grabbing three acres of land assigned to an ex-serviceman at Nagunoor on the outskirts of the town? The question assumes importance as investigators stumbled upon documents suggesting that Revenue department has assigned one acre and 20 guntas of the same land to one Lakshminarayana under ‘political sufferers’ quota. Interestingly, the Karimnagar police probing this case for the last two months could not trace Lakshminarayana so far. Fictitious person? What is more surprising is the investigators almost concluding that Lakshminarayana is a fictitious person. It is baffling that revenue authorities issued a letter assigning land to a person who never existed, says a police officer unwilling to be named. Strange case This strange case of land grabbing came to light a few weeks ago. Ex-serviceman Vinod Kumar approached the police stating that his land of three acres under survey no. 669 at Nagunoor on the town’s northern fringes was illegally occupied by some persons. This land was allotted to him by the government a few years ago. Mr. Kumar, who is temporarily living in Hyderabad, during a recent visit to Karimnagar learnt that some persons took possession of one acre and 20 guntas of his land. Following his complaint, an FIR was issued by Karimnagar rural police. Inquiries revealed that the revenue authorities issued letters allotting this piece of land to one Lakshminarayana under ‘political sufferers’ quota as Vinod Kumar was not in possession of the land. Police wanted to record the statement of the person to whom land was allotted. Interestingly, that Lakshminarayana could not be traced so far. Moreover, he had registered the one acre and 20 guntas of land in the names of three persons — B. Sudhakar, A. Malla Reddy and P. Neelima Reddy — who now say they have no clue on the whereabouts of Lakshminarayana. In the registration documents, Lakshminarayana mentioned that he was a resident of Vavilalapally. When police knocked the doors of the house number mentioned in the documents, the house owner turned out to be someone else. “We are now verifying how a person who never lived, got land allotment from government and managed even to register the land,” the investigators said. Organised gangs This and another recent case of illegal occupation of government land in Bommakal village are compelling police to believe that some organised gangs are involved such crimes. In the Bommakal case, police already arrested an ex-sarpanch, whose wife is a ZPTC member. The investigators believe more skeletons are likely to tumble out of the land grabbing cupboards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/karimnagar-land-grabbing-case-more-skeletons-to-tumble-out-of-closet/article32281627.ece
06 August 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Why no action against private hospitals for charging patients?’||Telangana High Court on Tuesday expressed dissatisfaction over reported refusal of Basavatarakam Indo American Cancer Hospital in Banjara Hills and Apollo Hospitals in Jubilee Hills to treat poor COVID-19 patients. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy, hearing a PIL plea seeking direction to the two hospitals to treat poor patients free of cost, said the issues raised by the petitioner need to be examined. Seventy-three-year-old Omim Maneckshaw Debara, who filed the plea, stated that the managements of the two hospitals secured government lands in city’s central and prime localities and were supposed to treat 15% to 25% of poor patients free of cost. The petitioner requested the court to secure details of the poor patients the Basavatarakam cancer hospital and Apollo hospital had treated since their establishment. The government had released separate orders in this regard, the petitioner said. The government should ensure that 40% outpatients were extended free treatment in the hospitals free of cost. He appealed to the court to instruct the government that the two hospitals complied with the provisions of the GOs issued through the revenue department with regard to free consultation and treatment to be extended to poor patients. Mr. Maneckshaw also asked the court to pass orders instructing the two hospitals to provide free treatment to poor COVID patients free of cost. These private corporate hospitals get prime lands on lease at concessional rates from government assuring that they would reserve 15% to 25% of beds for poor patients, said the bench. “Why the government was not initiating any action against these two hospitals when they were violating written assurances relating to free treatment,” the bench asked. The two GOs issued by the government clearly state that the hospitals should abide by the assurances with regard to free consultation and treatment to poor patients. Serious action should be taken against these two hospitals by cancelling their lease agreement and revoking their licenses to run the hospitals, the bench said. “This court is surprised that private hospitals are collecting phenomenal amounts from COVID-19 patients for treatment,” the bench remarked. Directing the Registry of the HC to tag the petition along with along with 18 other PIL pleas relating to COVID-19, the bench said the newspaper reports recently highlighted an instance of a private hospital refusing to release the body of a patient over bill payment. “Private hospitals are behaving as if they have rights over the dead bodies,” the bench said. The plea was posted to August 13 for next hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/why-no-action-against-private-hospitals-for-charging-patients/article32281599.ece

After cab aggregators entered the Indian market, he became one of the thousands working for one such company. His financial situation began to look up. For about four years, it was a smooth ride. But then, as the coronavirus pandemic struck leading to a lockdown, cabs went off the roads and his troubles began. Now, instead of picking up and dropping passengers, Mr Swamy sells vegetables to eke out a living. “I have been working as a driver for the past 18 years. I am a beneficiary of a government scheme which gives subsidy to buy four-wheelers for cab service. Once I got a car, a Swift D’zire Tour, four years ago, I began to earn better. But after the lockdown was announced, I found myself struggling to pay house rent,” the 47-year-old, who lives in a settlement near Film Nagar, says. Comfortable past Before the lockdown, he used to earn between Rs. 30,000 and Rs. 40,000 a month, depending on the number of hours he worked. But with cabs going off the roads as a part of the lockdown restrictions, his income fell drastically, almost to a naught. “I have a daughter who is an intermediate student. My son, who is 23 years old, also works as a driver. During the complete lockdown, we were struggling to pay the Rs. 4,700 house rent. I had to find work to run the house. So, I decided to sell vegetables,” he says. Now, every morning, Mr Swamy drives the same car to the Gudimalkapur vegetable market around 5 a.m. He buys leafy greens, tomatoes and almost every vegetable in between, and returns home around 7.30 a.m. “After buying everything, I begin to arrange vegetables properly in the car and go to areas like Film Nagar.,Prashasan Nagar, Journalist Colony, Nandagiri Hills and Jubilee Hills to sell them. Usually people do not bargain. But five days ago, I was slapped by a resident who did not want me to stop the car at a particular spot,” he says. While being a cabbie involved driving for long hours at a stretch, Mr Swamy says that the income was sufficient. The situation is not the same now. “I bought vegetables worth Rs. 4,000. I managed to sell worth Rs. 2,500. I am facing a loss if I don’t get everything cleared by night. I still have Rs. 30,000 in EMIs left on the car. It is important that I make these payments,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/lockdown-hit-cabbie-turns-vegetable-seller/article32281605.ece

06 August 2020||New Delhi,||Police reply sought on activist Kalita’s bail plea||The High Court on Wednesday asked Delhi Police to reply to Pinjra Tod activist Devangana Kalita’s plea seeking bail on a case related to the communal violence in north-east Delhi. Justice Suresh Kumar Kait issued notice to Delhi Police on Ms. Kalita’s plea challenging a trial court’s order, which had dismissed the bail application, and posted the case for further hearing on August 14. On June 14, a trial court had dismissed Ms. Kalita’s bail plea on the ground that there was no merit in the application and it was amply clear from the chargesheet that the investigation was still pending. The trial court further said that considering the investigation so far and the nature of the offence and the role being ascribed to the accused, there was no reason at all to grant bail. Ms. Kalita is currently facing four different FIRs connected with the anti-CAA protests in Jaffrabad, north-east Delhi riots and violence in Daryaganj during a protest against the new citizenship law last year. First arrest on May 23 Ms. Kalita was first arrested on May 23, along with fellow JNU student Natasha Narwal in connection with an FIR registered on February 24 over the sit-in protest at Jaffrabad metro station against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Delhi Police has also invoked sections of the stringent anti-terror law — Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act — in a separate case related to the communal violence, against Ms. Kalita for allegedly being part of a “premeditated conspiracy” in the riots.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/police-reply-sought-on-activist-kalitas-bail-plea/article32281531.ece

The incident took place late on Tuesday night, they said. A quarrel broke out between the couple and their neighbour over some issue, following which the 50-year-old accused stabbed the couple with a knife. Later, he went to his house, changed his bloodstained clothes and then allegedly consumed poison. Frequent fights Investigation revealed that the accused had fights in the past with the couple and other neighbours. The accused had a young daughter and was apparently not happy with the victim’s dressing sense. The accused had earlier objected to his wearing shorts and sitting in front of their house. This had led to many fights, a police officer said. However, the exact reason behind the quarrel on the night of the incident is still unknown, he said. DCP (Outer North) Gaurav Sharma said, “When our team was inspecting the crime scene, the accused [who had consumed poison before the team reached] went up to the terrace to hide.” After he was caught, the accused confessed to killing the couple.

06 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||DUTA writes to CM to release staffers’ salaries||The Delhi University Teachers’ Association on Wednesday wrote to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal requesting him to immediately release salaries of teachers and non-teaching staff of 12 government-funded colleges. In its letter, the association said over 1,500 teachers and non-teaching staffers in colleges have gone without salaries and pension for the past two months or more and in most colleges, employees have not received salaries from May onwards. “A large number of these employees, including ad hoc teachers and karamcharis working on contract basis, do not have ecosystems which can cushion them through such a crisis. Employees and their families are facing extreme hardship because of this inordinate delay in salaries,” the DUTA said. Flimsy excuses The teachers told Mr. Kejriwal that it was becoming very difficult to deal with the crisis caused by the “unjust action of withholding grants citing flimsy excuses such as non-formation of governing bodies, paucity of funds or enquiries set up in a few colleges, for which the employees are not responsible”. They asked what could be a more feudal form of governance. The teachers added that DU colleges are amongst the best colleges in the country and they fear that the ongoing crisis will destabilise these units. “This anti-employee action can only result in a deeper crisis for these institutions. We once again urge you to resolve the issues,” the teachers said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/duta-writes-to-cm-to-release-staffers-salaries/article32281538.ece

06 August 2020||Mumbai,||Young NCP, Congress leaders back Aaditya||A day after Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray slammed the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for playing dirty politics over the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, young leaders from the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have come out in support of Mr. Thackeray. NCP MLA Rohit Pawar said while there was no doubt that the Rajput’s family must get justice, it was evident that dirty politics is being played over his death by people within and outside the State. “The image of police is being maligned, hampering the morale of the force. We must stand with our police force challenging the politics of the Opposition. It is extremely wrong to target police instead of standing with them as a Marathi,” he said. Mr. Pawar said he agrees with the statement made by Mr Thackeray. “But I must say that the people of Maharashtra can see everything clearly a and they have never entertained such petty politics,” he said. Maharashtra youth Congress president Satyajeet Tambe also came out in support of Mr. Thackeray. “Aaditya, you should not worry. The people are smart enough. Even a small boy can tell if the Mumbai Police is more efficient or the Bihar Police. This dirty politics is a result of people being unable to deal with the good work done by you,” he said on Twitter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/young-ncp-congress-leaders-back-aaditya/article32281547.ece

06 August 2020||Pune,||Red alert issued in several parts of State as downpour continues||Even as Mumbai saw extremely heavy rain on Wednesday leading to widespread damage, a red alert has been issued in several parts of the State. It has been forecasted that Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Satara, Raigad, Thane and Palghar will see extremely heavy rain at isolated places till Thursday. Alerts were also issued in western Maharashtra’s Kolhapur and Sangli district on Wednesday as levels of Panchganga, Warna and Krishna rivers rose due to heavy rain, officials said. Heavy showers in Kolhapur led to rising river water levels causing as many as 90 barrages in the district to be submerged. With the IMD forecasting heavy rain for Kolhapur, Satara and the ghat areas of Pune till August 7, the Kolhapur district authorities have ordered the immediate evacuation of citizens from low-lying areas as a precautionary measure. “The district has been receiving very heavy rains continuously for the last two days. Relentless downpour has been witnessed not just in the catchment areas, but also in areas around them. This has led to a sharp rise in river water levels,” said District Collector Daulat Desai. Dangerous waters The water level of the Panchganga River near Rajaram Bridge was nudging the ‘alert mark’, said authorities. “The river is flowing at 35 ft. near the Rajaram Bridge. The ‘alert mark’ is 39 ft. and the danger mark is 43 ft. It is very likely that the waters will near the danger level by tomorrow morning,” Mr. Desai said. In this vein, the Collector said that he had directed the residents of low-lying areas near the Panchganga River, especially those living in Karvir taluk to evacuate immediately to safer areas with their livestock. “Given the experience of last year’s terrible deluge, all residents living around the Panchganga River must move immediately to safer zones along with their livestock. This particularly applies to people living in the villages of Chikhali and Ambewadi which are at high-risk,” he said. The Sangli district administration also asked people living on the banks of the Krishna and Warna rivers to stay alert. “Due to heavy rains in the region, their water level is increasing,” an official said. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has sent two teams to Kolhapur as a preemptive measure. “Two more teams are moving there,” said an NDRF official. Pune district, too, witnessed robust showers throughout the day, causing the water stocks in the district’s four major dams — Khadakwasla, Panshet, Varasgaon and Temghar — to rise sharply.

06 August 2020||Sonam Saigal Mumbai,||HC gives nod to cut 357 mangroves for Metro 4||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday allowed the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) to cut 357 mangrove trees as part of the Metro 4 work. The court said, “We are convinced beyond any doubt that the construction of Metro 4 is a project of immense importance from the point of view of public transport.” A Division Bench of Justices S.J. Kathawalla and R.I. Chagla was hearing a petition filed by the MMRDA seeking permission to go ahead with the construction of Metro 4, which will connect areas such as Wadala, Ghatkopar, Mulund, Thane and Kasarwadawali. However, 48 piers of the 1.2 km alignment at the proposed Bhakti Park station, and 0.1236 hectares of a temporary approach road fall under the Coastal Regulation Zone II area. The MMRDA had sent an online application to the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority seeking permission to axe 357 mangrove trees for the construction of the Metro piers and the approach road to Bhakti Park station. On March 11, the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, in a letter to the Secretary (Forest), Maharashtra, granted “in-principle” sanction under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, for the diversion of 0.985 hectares of reserved forest land in favour of the MMRDA, subject to conditions. In turn, the MMRDA has agreed to bear the cost of afforestation of 0.12 hectares of mangrove forest land, and plant 4,444 mangrove saplings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-gives-nod-to-cut-357-mangroves-for-metro-4/article32281551.ece
06 August 2020||Chennai/New Delhi,||India’s move on Article 370 is ‘illegal and invalid’, says China||India on Wednesday told China “not to comment on the internal affairs” of other countries, in response to Beijing describing the dilution of Article 370, on the one-year anniversary of the move, as being “illegal and invalid”. China had “no locus standi ” on the matter, the Ministry of External Affairs said. In a statement in Beijing, in response to a question from the Pakistani media, the Chinese Foreign Ministry repeated its opposition to “any unilateral change to the status quo” in Jammu and Kashmir, echoing its statements on the issue last year. “China follows closely the situation in the Kashmir region,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday. “Our position is consistent and clear. This issue is a dispute left over from history between Pakistan and India. That is an objective fact established by the UN Charter, UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements between Pakistan and India. Any unilateral change to the status quo is illegal and invalid.” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said India had “noted the comments of the Chinese MFA spokesperson on the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir”. “The Chinese side has no locus standi whatsoever on this matter and is advised not to comment on the internal affairs of other nations,” he said. Last year, Beijing had particularly voiced its opposition to the creation of a Union Territory in Ladakh, which included within its boundaries the Aksai Chin region, now occupied by China, although India had pointed out to China that the change had not altered India’s external boundaries or its territorial claims in any way. Wednesday’s statement from Beijing did not mention Ladakh. Mr. Wang said the Kashmir issue “should be properly resolved peacefully through dialogue and consultation between the parties concerned”. “Pakistan and India are neighbours that cannot be moved away,” he said. “Peaceful coexistence serves the fundamental interests of both and the common aspiration of the international community. China hopes that they can properly handle the differences through dialogue, improve relations, and jointly safeguard peace, stability and development of both countries and the wider region.” The Foreign Ministry did not, however, respond to a question on a new map issued by Pakistan on Tuesday and refrained from criticising the move. “I have already stated China’s position on the Kashmir issue,” Mr. Wang said, adding he would not repeat the statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/indias-move-on-article-370-is-illegal-and-invalid-says-china/article32281278.ece

06 August 2020||COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka sees 71% polling||Polling for Sri Lanka’s parliamentary election concluded on Wednesday with a voter turnout of 71%. The results will be released on Thursday, the Election Commission said. After postponing the elections twice in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Sri Lanka became the first South Asian country to hold election months after COVID-19 struck, claiming 11 lives in the island. However, the country’s public health sector managed to contain the numbers — 286 active cases as of Wednesday — with support from the Army, drawing international praise, including from the World Health Organization.

They maintained physical distancing with fellow voters, as they elected representatives to the new Parliament, in which the ruling Rajapaksa administration is seeking a two-thirds majority. The race includes two past Presidents — Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is Prime Minister in the current caretaker government, and Maithripala Sirisena — former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his United National Party’s former deputy leader Sajith Premadasa, who now leads a breakaway alliance. The Rajapaksas’ Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP, or People’s Party) is widely expected to secure a comfortable majority in the 225-member legislature, paving way for President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to yet again appoint his elder brother Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister. Though many feared that the voter turnout might drop due to the pandemic, voters came out to exercise their franchise, recording a 71 % turnout, about 6 percentage points lower than the turnout in the general elections of 2015. There were no major incidents of violence reported on polling day. “No violence, only violations,” chairman of Election Commission Mahinda Deshapriya told a media conference Wednesday evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-sees-71-polling/article32281231.ece

The President’s Elysee Palace office said Mr. Macron will “meet all political actors”, including President Michel Aoun and Prime Minister Hassan Diab. Both sides will be hoping the visit goes more smoothly than a trip last month by France’s top diplomat Jean-Yves Le Drian, who scolded Lebanon’s political elite for being too “passive” in the face of an economic crisis compounded by the COVID-19 outbreak. In the aftermath of that visit, Foreign Minister Nassif Hitti resigned in protest at his government’s lack of crisis management. France has sent three planes to Beirut loaded with rescuers, medical equipment and a mobile clinic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/macron-to-visit-beirut-as-france-pushes-reconstruction/article32281230.ece

The visit, headed by health chief Alex Azar, comes as relations between the world’s two biggest powers plunge to historic lows. “This marks... the first Cabinet member to visit in six years, and the highest level visit by a U.S. Cabinet official since 1979,” said Washington’s de facto Embassy, the American Institute in Taiwan, with no date yet given for the visit. Washington remains the leading arms supplier to the island but has historically been cautious in holding official contacts with it. Beijing views Taiwan as its own territory — vowing to one day seize it — and bristles at any moves by other countries to recognise or communicate with Taipei. “China firmly opposes official exchanges between the U.S. and Taiwan,” Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, said as he called for the visit to be cancelled. Taiwan said Mr. Azar would meet President Tsai Ing-wen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-plan-for-highest-level-taiwan-visit-angers-china/article32281232.ece
06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||The urban migrant and the ‘ritual’ tug of home||Did our urban, means-ends rationality get it wrong again? Was it lockdown-related job loss that poisoned the well and led migrant workers, mostly single men, to head for their villages? Or, was there something non-economic, not quite this-worldly either, that turned their stomachs? The migrant worker, when in crisis, is not seeking material help from his family in the village; they are, anyway, much poorer than he is. What disturbs him profoundly at such times is the fear of dying alone with nobody to perform the rites for him. In nearly every religion, the family plays a central role in the observance of mortuary rituals. Not just that, these have to be performed correctly so that the departed soul can easily negotiate the afterlife. Unemployment as part of life It is considerations of this kind, more than financial hardship, that prompt single migrant workers to leave for their rural homes. The Indian labouring classes are much less rattled by joblessness as unemployment is a frequent, if unwelcome, visitor at their door. This is clearly an outcome of the fact that 93% of our economy is informal. Ironically, the Industrial Disputes Act encourages this trend. It mandates employers to pay severance wages, and other benefits, only if workers are hired, and on the rolls, continuously for over 248 days. This law has had the unintended consequence of making it attractive for management to periodically flip labour around. As a result, only a minuscule minority stays employed for long. Most other workers suffer joblessness for long periods in the bear pit called the city. Yet, it took just two days of the lockdown for a large number of male workers to start the trudge to their respective villages. Forget the industrial glue When faced with an imminent threat to life, the tug of home and family is much stronger for the migrant worker than the industrial glue that comes with an urban occupation. This job could be well paid and the worker may have even held it for some time. There are no laboratory conditions to settle this issue, but a comparative approach might help. In Surat in 1979, when there was a widespread fear that a satellite was going to fall smack in the city centre, causing untold deaths, a large number of migrants there left for their villages. Again, in Surat, in 1994, the plague scare prompted over 6,00,000 to leave their work stations for the railway station. In both these instances, jobs were not threatened, but there was this perceived fear of death. On the other hand, when demonetisation happened in 2016, only a few migrant workers left because this distress was primarily economic, without a threat to life. Later, in 2020, when COVID-19 started killing wantonly, there was a radical shift; now, men without families went home because they did not want to die alone. We missed paying attention to this fact in the latest pandemic exodus because it was accompanied by an economic downturn. It also satisfied our middle-class mentality because, from our angle of vision, economic lenses provide the right focal point. For the better off, even a temporary job loss can be traumatic. Besides a bruised self-esteem, there are also equated monthly instalments, or EMIs and mortgages to be paid. It is not uncommon, under these conditions, for a middle class person to turn to the family, as the first port of call. Data from survey A 2018 CBRE survey shows that 80% of young Indian millennials live with their parents. Further, a YouGov-Mint-CPR Millennial Survey conducted in 2020 tells us that they depend on their parents’ real estate property and savings to give them a start. No wonder, Census figures show that joint families are growing, albeit slowly, in urban India, but declining in the villages. But the short, bullet point is that unemployment does not send migrant workers to their villages because their families there are in no position to help them financially. What brings them home is the dread of dying on alien soil without the necessary prayers. Rituals and customs Among Muslims, washing of the body as well as the lowering of the shrouded corpse are important aspects of death rituals and ought to be performed by the immediate family. Despite regional variations, certain aspects of Islamic mortuary customs are constant. Death rituals vary among Hindus too. There is no consensus, for instance, on how many days must elapse before major mourning rituals such as chautha and shraddha can commence. Also, most Hindus are cremated, but some are buried too. Only the family would know the minutiae of these details. Further, among Hindus, male blood kin alone can perform the pind daan and the ritual erasure of debts, or ( rin ), of the dead relative. If these, and other rules, are not followed correctly, the soul of the dead person could suffer perpetual torment in the other world. It will take more than a job somewhere to overcome the fear of dying anonymously, without proper ceremonies being performed. Forced by poverty, workers can take economic hardship on their chin and stomach at the same time. They may have a face for radio and a voice for silent films, but in the theatre of survival, they move adeptly, playing their part. It is in the theatre of death that they need their families to provide the props. If about 90% of slum dwellers in Dharavi stayed put, post lockdown, it was because most of them lived with their wives and children and did not fear a death without rituals. Newspapers were quick to notice that it was mostly men walking on highways, or leaving from train stations and bus stands. Though the image of vulnerable women and children in the midst of all this is much more wrenching, their numbers were not that many. Gender factor This is not a trivial observation because women actually form 55% (or, the majority) of rural migrants to urban India. If there were fewer of them on highways it was because arranged marriages have brought most of them to the city, not a flimsy job prospect. This makes their transition more permanent because they now generally have properly anchored urban husbands. These women, in the fullness of time, make a home, birth a family and nobody in that unit need any longer fear dying alone and un-prayed. On the other hand, rural men migrate with tentative employment prospects and it will be a long time before they can, if at all, imagine getting their families over. Of course, a stable job, with entitlements, would let them live that dream. Till then, the thought of death and a frantic bus ticket home will always be paired. Even so, despite economic uncertainties, and underemployment, about 72% of slum dwellings are owned, not rented. This shows the overwhelming preference the poor have for family life, only if they could afford one. When urban workers rush to their rural homes, it is because they fear a death where nobody prays for them more than a life where nobody pays them.

06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Taking nuclear vulnerabilities seriously||Seventy-five years ago, the Japanese city of Hiroshima was destroyed by one single atomic bomb. Three days later, a second bomb destroyed Nagasaki. Those two bombs killed over 2,00,000 people, some of them instantaneously, and others within five months. Another 2,00,000 people or more who survived the bombings of these two cities, most of them injured, have been called the hibakusha . Because of the long-lasting effects of radiation exposure as well as the mental trauma they underwent, the plight of these survivors has been difficult. As Akihiro Takahashi, a hibakusha , testified: “I’ve been living on dragging my body full of sickness and from time to time I question myself. I wonder if it is worth living in such hardship and pain.” But Takahashi and other hibakusha lived on and talked about their experiences in the hope that their plight would never befall anyone else. While Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been the last two cities to be destroyed by nuclear weapons, we cannot be sure that they will be the last. Since 1945, the United States, the Soviet Union/Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea have armed themselves with nuclear weapons that have much more destructive power in comparison to those that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Damage and vulnerability Over 1,26,000 nuclear weapons have been built since the beginning of the atomic age. Over 2,000 of them have been used in nuclear tests, above and below the ground, to demonstrate their explosive power, causing grave and long-lasting damage to the environment and public health. But this damage is nothing compared to what might happen if some of the existing weapons are used against civilian populations. An appreciation of the scale of the potential damage and a realisation that nuclear weapons could be launched at any moment against any target around the world should instil a sense of vulnerability in all of us. To appreciate why we are vulnerable, we should start by realising that there is no realistic way to protect ourselves against nuclear weapons, whether they are used deliberately, inadvertently, or accidentally. The invention of ballistic missiles at the end of the 1950s, with their great speed of delivery, has made it impossible to intercept nuclear weapons once they are launched. Neither fallout shelters nor ballistic missile defence systems have succeeded in negating this vulnerability. Nuclear weapon states are targets of other nuclear weapon states, of course, but non-nuclear weapon states are vulnerable as well. The problems of deterrence Nuclear weapon states have reacted to this vulnerability by coming up with a comforting idea: that the use of nuclear weapons is impossible because of deterrence. Nuclear weapons are so destructive that no country would use them, because such use would invite retaliation in kind, and no political leader would be willing to risk the possible death of millions of their citizens. That was the idea of deterrence. Deterrence enthusiasts claim that nuclear weapons do not just protect countries against use of nuclear weapons by others, but even prevent war and promote stability. These claims do not hold up to evidence. Nuclear threats have not always produced fear and, in turn, fear has not always induced caution. To the contrary, nuclear threats in some cases have produced anger, and anger can trigger a drive to escalate, as was the case with Fidel Castro during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Moreover, the apparent efficacy of deterrence in some cases may have been due to the more credible prospect of retaliation with conventional weapons. Countries with nuclear weapons have in fact gone to war quite often, even with other countries with nuclear weapons, albeit in a limited fashion or through proxies. Countries, however, might not always show such restraint. Nor should nuclear deterrence be considered stable. Strategic planners routinely use worst-case assumptions about the intentions and capabilities of other countries to argue for the acquisition of greater destructive capabilities, driving endless upgrades of nuclear arsenals, and offering a rationale for new countries to acquire nuclear weapons. Implicitly, however, all nuclear weapon states have admitted to the possibility that deterrence could fail: they have made plans for using nuclear weapons, in effect, preparing to fight nuclear war. The disjuncture between the ideal of possessing nuclear weapons for deterrence and the practical reality of keeping these weapons primed for use has been eloquently clarified by General Lee Butler, former Commander-in-Chief of the United States Strategic Command. After years of having the top operational responsibility for all U.S. strategic nuclear forces, he observed: “The goal — the wish, really — might be to prevent nuclear war, but the operational plan had to be to wage war.” It is thus an illusion to think that nuclear war is impossible. The illusion of control A related illusion concerns the controllability of nuclear weapons. In the real world, it is not possible for planners to have complete control. However, the desire to believe in the perfect controllability and safety of nuclear weapons creates overconfidence, which is dangerous. Overconfidence, as many scholars studying safety will testify, is more likely to lead to accidents and possibly to the use of nuclear weapons. In several historical instances, what prevented the use of nuclear weapons was not control practices but either their failure or factors outside institutional control. The most famous of these cases is the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. There are likely many more cases during which the world came close to nuclear war but because of the secrecy that surrounds nuclear weapons, we might never know. If deterrence has not prevented nuclear war so far, what has? While a comprehensive answer to this question will necessarily involve diverse and contingent factors, one essential element in key episodes is just plain luck. This is, again, best illustrated by the case of the Cuban Missile Crisis, where nearly four decades of scholarship attest to the crucial role of luck. The consequences of bad luck, then or later, could make the COVID-19 pandemic seem benign by comparison. While humanity has luckily survived 75 years without experiencing nuclear war, can one expect luck to last indefinitely?

06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Secular fundamentalism in a time of ‘bhoomi pujan’||I joined the Congress party when Rajiv Gandhi was Prime Minister. The party then was in steep decline. As expected, he was defeated. My political life began when future prospects for the Congress were bleak. Why then did I join? Principally because the Congress alone was the contemporary embodiment of the Idea of India bequeathed to us by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, and exemplified by the opening lines of the Prime Minster in a debate he had himself initiated in the Lok Sabha: “A secular India alone is an India that can survive. Perhaps an India that is not secular does not deserve to survive.” That India faced the most serious challenge mounted till then to secularism as we had understood it for four decades. I wanted to be part of the response. A missing word Yet today, when more than ever before in independent India’s history, it is necessary to reiterate our unflinching commitment to secularism, the word that is absent from the party’s vocabulary. We are falling over ourselves celebrating the event, pushing to one side the fact that the bhoomi pujan ceremony at Ayodhya was conducted at the site of the sacrilege committed in destroying a place of worship of the minority community. We say we are only observing, as we have always said we would, the judgment of the Supreme Court of India, but seem to have forgotten that the judgment also described the demolition of the masjid as barbaric. It is that barbaric act which opened the way to the bhoomi pujan . We cannot, and must not, forget the thousands of innocent Indians butchered in the wake of L.K. Advani’s chariot of fire and in the aftermath of the razing of the Babri Masjid. An alternative ‘Idea of India’ The event is a celebration of an alternative Idea of India, a ‘Hindu Rashtra’, that the Congress has always opposed on the same grounds that it denied Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s two-nation theory. When Pakistan was created, we insisted that even if Pakistan were to declare itself an Islamic state, we would not validate Jinnah’s contention by becoming a Hindu nation. We would proudly proclaim our secular values. We considered ourselves equally the inheritors of “The Wonder that was India” as of all that had become part of India over millennia, including our Islamic inheritance. That is why Jawaharlal Nehru, as the Prime Minister of a secular nation, refused to involve his government in the rebuilding of the Somnath temple despite the championing of that cause by his indispensable companion, Sardar Vallabhai Patel. He also refused permission to President Rajendra Prasad to attend the opening of the rebuilt temple as the Head of a secular State. Now, we have the spectacle of the Prime Minister of a still allegedly secular India attending the bhoomi pujan and are afraid of raising our voice, as a secular party, against this blatantly partisan sectarian act. Indeed, we have not even suggested that Gandhiji’s favourite Ram dhun be sung on the occasion, “ Ishwar Allah tero naam/sabko sanmati de Bhagwan ”. Let us also remember that at the height of the rioting in Delhi, Gandhiji insisted that all occupied masjids be returned to the Muslim community. We have drifted so far from what we believed in because we seem no longer to believe in it. We now have Congress leaders boasting that Rajiv Gandhi opened the locks of the Masjid at Ayodhya. He did not. This was done by sleight of hand without his knowledge by leaning on the local judiciary to pass an order that was implemented with undue haste within half-an-hour of the order being passed. The Prime Minister was informed only when it was already a judicially ordained fait accompli . His main concern was to put a status quo in place and ensure that the monument was protected from vandalism. I was with him when during the Lok Sabha campaign, he urged Congress candidates in the vicinity of Ayodhya to bus leaders of the Muslim community to Ayodhya to see for themselves that — notwithstanding the ill-advised shilanyas — the Masjid was still standing. The only one to do so was Kalpnath Rai. He was also the only Congressman to win between Amethi and Calcutta. What the top court also said To respect the Supreme Court’s judgment does not mean to celebrate the outrage of the Masjid’s destruction. We must also remind everyone that the same Supreme Court urged the expeditious completion of the trial of those indicted for that destruction by, among others, the Liberhan Commission. We must also ask whether the Prime Minister will demonstrate the nation’s secular belief in sarva dharma sambhava by attending the foundation stone laying ceremony of the masjid that has been decreed by the Supreme Court. Thus far, he has delighted in being photographed in every conceivable headgear — except the Muslim skullcap that he declined to wear even at an Eid milan . As Congressmen and women, we must also remind all concerned that Rajiv Gandhi permitted the shilanyas only in what he had been assured was undisputed territory. What was being celebrated at the bhoomi pujan is the construction of a temple at the site of the demolished mosque. Moreover, we appear to have forgotten that a Congress Prime Minister, on the morrow of the demolition, had promised a mosque at the demolished site to replace the demolished one. These are the issues we should be raising, not joining the sectarian chorus that rises from the throats that have cried out: “ Ek dhakka aur do /Babri Masjid thod do .” The Muslim community is quiescent but concerned. As far as it is concerned, the Congress as a party has long lost its secular credentials for fear of being labelled “appeasers”. We hesitate to affirm what Jawaharlal Nehru had no hesitation in affirming when we were in the throes of the Partition trauma and on the eve of the first-ever elections with full adult franchise in a nation that had just emerged from the furnace of vicious communal violence. Nehru said categorically that whatever the electoral consequences, win or lose, he was not going to let the Congress join the communal madness. On Gandhi Jayanti in 1951, he proclaimed at a public rally on the Ram Lila grounds: “If any man raises his hand against another in the name of religion, I shall fight him till the last breath of my life, whether from inside the government or outside.” He also held consistently that “majority communalism is worse than minority communalism”. Taking a stand That is what we should be telling the saffron brotherhood today rather than competing with them to determine who is more Hindu — the Congress or the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)? We should be asking instead: who is more secular, the Congress or the BJP? We are trying to usurp their space. We would be better advised to fight for our own principled ‘Idea of a secular India’, whatever the perceived electoral cost. We can only justify our existence in the eyes of the nation as an alternative to the BJP, not as a pale imitation.

06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Books, not bullets in J&K||Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) has witnessed more than three decades of proxy war and violence. The most adversely affected among all sections of society have been the children and youth of the region. Young minds which were supposed to be aspirational, educated, skilled and equipped to face the challenges of the 21st century were instead initiated into violence, terrorism, indoctrination and anti-national sentiments. But on the historic day of August 5, 2019, there came a paradigm shift in the history of J&K. The newly-carved out Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh opened new avenues and created a plethora of opportunities for the people. Before August 5, 2019, the burning of schools and educational institutions was a ritual and a matter of pride. In the last year, it has been heartening to find that news of the burning of educational institutions has just evaporated. Children, teachers and Education Departments are ecstatic to shoulder new responsibilities. The education ecosystem in the State has changed and the Centre has taken up the key challenges of ensuring quality, equity and access in education to the last child. Welcoming change Within a few weeks of the Union Territory being formed, I had an opportunity as the Union Minister of Education to interact with more than 1,500 teachers and educationists. People of the Valley were very warm and welcoming and reposed their utmost faith in the government’s policies. It is the sheer commitment of teachers, the Education Department and the administrative machinery of the Union Territories that ensured that the academic year was not wasted despite the inevitable lockdown and demographic challenges. During my interaction with Vice-Chancellors, heads of educational institutions, teachers and parents, a point that emerged was “enough is enough”. There was unanimity about getting into the mainstream and moving onto the developmental path, discarding decades-old outdated, orthodox and regressive ideologies. In the last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reviewed several projects at regular intervals in the newly formed Union Territories. Approval for a Central University in Ladakh has been granted in tune with the commitment made to the people of the hilly region. This university will be a landmark in providing quality education to students of not only the Ladakh region but also the border districts of Himachal Pradesh. The university campus will also have a Centre for Buddhist students, fulfilling a demand of local populace. To ensure universalisation of education, the Right to Education Act 2009 being extended to J&K is in the final stage. Capacity building of the education infrastructure in the Jammu-Kashmir region is another focus area along with large-scale curriculum reforms, teachers’ training, infrastructure upgradation and integration of education technology. A range of projects The upgradation is being undertaken on a war footing. The government is committed to the welfare of the people of the region, and all possible measures are being taken to ensure that no child is left out. In addition, 23,405 children with special needs have been identified and are being enrolled in school. Also 1,417 seasonal centres for learning have been set up to provide training to children of Gujjar and Bakkarwal communities owing to their unique migrant lifestyle. Further, 88 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas along with hostels for girls are being made functional. Fifty new government degree colleges in J&K have been sanctioned and made operational. Nineteen new modern schools (on the pattern of Kendriya Vidyalayas) will be developed in the next three years. Upgradation of smart/IT-enabled classrooms to deliver e-content will bridge the gap in the post-COVID-19 scenario. A Jammu and Kashmir Education Investment Policy 2020 has been framed and finalised. Projects worth Rs. 327 crore for a hi-tech education city and colleges/universities have been received by the Administration. It is indeed a new beginning in the history of the violence-torn region. With the arrival of NEP 2020, the Union Ministry of Education is committed to make India a global knowledge centre at a fast pace with a focus on basic literary, numeracy, vocational skills. With the Prime Minister’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat, the government is fully committed to ensuring that the developmental agenda in both Union Territories is not derailed. I firmly believe that education is the best gift we can give to our generations. Quality education is the best investment which will pay us dividends in the years ahead. The NEP 2020 is only the beginning of this transformation.

06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||How to pay for the stimulus||Former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh and his Congress party colleague Praveen Chakravarty have, in these pages, written on the appropriate policy response to the currently depressed state of the economy. Given Dr. Singh’s deep understanding of the subject, this is in the nature of invaluable counsel. Unlike the dispensation in power, he and his colleague are for government intervention to revive the economy. They present greater public spending as the sine qua non of such a revival, and they are absolutely correct in this diagnosis. They also present the options available and rank them, in the sense of recommending the order in which they ought to be considered for use. Greater public spending will increase the fiscal deficit and this expansion has to be financed. Theoretically it can be financed by higher taxes. However, when the economy is in a recession, this is usually not in the reckoning even though the balanced-budget multiplier is one, i.e., output expands by exactly the same amount as the increase in government spending. Debt vs. money financing So, what are the options? They are: issuing debt to the public, and borrowing from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), termed ‘money financing’ as it increases the money supply. Dr. Singh and Mr. Chakravarty plump for increased debt. While they do not rule out of court money financing, they suggest that it may be imprudent to do so. Instead, they recommend borrowing from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, it is not clear that this is a superior strategy. The media has recently reported some economists responding to the suggestion of money financing with the Friedman-esque quip “there ain’t no free lunch”. But it may be mentioned that there is no free lunch in the case of debt financing either. Not only have the moneys to be repaid, they will have to be paid back in hard currency. This would involve India having to earn hard currency by stepping up exports. If a stimulus of approximately 10% of the GDP is envisaged, with exports at 25% of the GDP, it would imply stepping up exports by close to 50%. This would be a herculean task under present circumstances. Indian exports have been faring poorly since 2014. Since then, there have been multiple shocks to global output and trade. Three more issues are relevant when considering borrowing from the World Bank and the IMF. First, there is the issue of conditionalities. There is no reason to oppose conditionalities on principle but it is not obvious what conditionalities will come along with the loan. Second, a loan is bound to take some time to be negotiated, taxing the energies of a government that ought to be engaged in the day to day battle with COVID-19. Third, external debt is truly national which, arguably, government bonds held by the country’s private sector are not. A taboo subject When money financing is proposed, it elicits a negative response from some quarters with something akin to a taboo being invoked against the idea. But invoking taboo is not serious economics which would require that a good reason be given for opposing the use of money financing to expand public spending at present. Dr. Singh and Mr. Chakravarty speak of “high intangible and institutional costs” associated with it but do not expand on this. The standard economic argument against money financing is that it is inflationary. However, whether a fiscal expansion is inflationary or not is related more to the state of the economy than the medium of its financing. When resources are unemployed, output may be expected to expand without inflation. As COVID-19 has shocked output downwards, unemployed resources must now exist. There is no reasoned case for denying ourselves the option of money financing to take us back to pre-COVID-19 levels of output and employment.

06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Delayed start||The Indian Premier League (IPL) marches to a beat of its own. It may lack the enduring international appeal of the World Cup, the Ashes or tussles featuring India and Pakistan, yet for a domestic cricket league that blends the local with the global, the IPL has commercial heft and guarantees annual thrills. Since its launch on an April night at Bengaluru in 2008, the league gained traction and also suffered controversies. The 2013 spot-fixing crisis forced a cleansing exercise within the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) but the tournament continued unhindered. Even two general elections could not stop the IPL as South Africa conducted the event in 2009 while the United Arab Emirates (UAE) staged the first half during 2014. But the current year, wilting under a raging pandemic, has altered life and routines. The IPL, slotted for the summer, was postponed. For a sporting brand valued at Rs. 47,500 crore and head-lined by blue chip cricketers, the stakes are high and the BCCI scouted for a window to prop up the league. Opportunity arose when Australia shelved the ICC Twenty20 World Cup from October 18 to November 15. With India still grappling with coronavirus, the UAE stepped in and the IPL will be held there from September 19 to November 10, subject to the central government’s approval, now deemed a formality. Essentially a recreational activity, sport is also considered as war minus the shooting and even the IPL is not immune to the resultant pressures. Once the league’s governing council mentioned over the weekend that Vivo, the cellphone company with Chinese roots, will continue to be the title sponsor, all hell broke loose. The border stand-off on the icy Himalayas was bound to have its economic repercussions in an atmosphere rippling with nationalistic fervour. For now both Vivo and the BCCI have blinked, a separation is certain, and the hunt for a lead sponsor is on. If commerce is one headache to be dealt with, the bigger migraine is the absolute importance that has to be given to conducting the tournament in bio-secure bubbles at Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah. With eight squads and 60 games spread over 53 days, the organisers cannot afford any slip even if spectators are kept at bay. Recently, England speedster Jofra Archer reacted to a basic human urge — the need to go home, but in these fraught times, his move almost put the entire England-West Indies series in peril as he had breached medical protocols. West Asia with its Indian diaspora has its distractions and the IPL officials have to ensure that while cricket prospers on the turf, the larger picture of health is not ignored. The virus remains a threat, and the thirst for profit should not override public health concerns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/delayed-start/article32281209.ece
06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Beirut battered||The devastating blast in central Beirut on Tuesday that killed 135 people and wounded 4,000 has once again turned the spotlight on a city that had in the past survived civil wars, sectarian violence, foreign interventions and terrorist attacks. While there is no dearth of conspiracy theories, the initial assessment of the government is that the blast was caused by the detonation of more than 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been stored in a warehouse at the Beirut port after it was confiscated from a cargo ship six years ago. Officials say the initial explosion ignited a fire, while the second one was more devastating with a mushroom cloud of smoke and fire enveloping the capital’s skyline and its shock waves battering buildings across the city and wounding thousands. Officials have said they would investigate any potential terror angle, while Prime Minister Hassan Diab has promised to bring “all those responsible for this catastrophe” to justice. U.S. President Donald Trump has called it an attack. The magnitude of the blast and the level of the destruction it caused in one of the busiest areas of the capital city suggest that the casualties could be higher. Beirut’s health-care system, struggling to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, is already stretched. Coping with the aftermath of the blast itself would be an uphill task for the country’s beleaguered government. The blast could not have come at a worse time for Lebanon. In recent years, it has been battling with one crisis or another — be it political instability, a crumbling economy or the pandemic. Massive street protests that broke out in Beirut and elsewhere last year against corruption and the government’s inability to provide even basic services to citizens, paralysed governance further, leading to Prime Minister Saad Hariri’s resignation. The new government’s immediate priority was to fix the economy. But the economy is still in free fall. Prices of essential goods are high, foreign currency is scarce and the GDP is expected to contract 12% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Residents of Beirut are also struggling with long power outages, which are delaying even the rescue efforts after the blast. On the southern border, tensions between Israel and Hezbollah are on the rise, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of military action. If Lebanon was already on its knees, amidst all these crises, the blast would most likely break its back. It has rendered hundreds of thousands homeless and would deepen the country’s economic woes as one of its main ports has been destroyed. The immediate focus should be on rescuing the wounded and getting the city back on its feet. All stakeholders, from the Sunni parties to Shia Hezbollah, should work together. Other countries in the region as well as international institutions should offer help to Beirut to withstand this moment of catastrophe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/beirut-battered/article32281208.ece
06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Cheating at examinations||It is difficult to believe that so responsible a body as the Executive Council of the Indore University should have decided that students copying answer papers or resorting to other unfair means should not be suspended but merely fined Rs. 50 and allowed to appear for the same examination soon after. It is scarcely necessary to labour the point that, if cheating is tolerated, condoned or treated as a minor offence, the value of the public examination disappears as an objective test of merit. In fact, two alternatives have been suggested which merit consideration. One is the American semester system in which class tests take the place of long drawn out public examinations. In this system, the responsibility for judging the performance of the pupil is placed on the local professor and the college. The other alternative is to allow the use of books and reference material in the examination hall, the questions being so framed that an intelligent use of material is needed to answer them. But neither of these systems envisages the copying of answers by one student from another or assistance by teachers to students during the examinations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/cheating-at-examinations/article32281221.ece
06 August 2020||HYDERABAD,||Centre formulating R&D policy to bolster drug discovery||The Centre will soon unveila new Research & Development (R&D) policy to boost drug discovery and the manufacture of medical devices in the country. Alongside, numerous production-linked incentives are also on the anvil, including to the scientists involved in the process, P.D. Vaghela, Secretary, Department of Pharmaceuticals, said on Wednesday. The government proposes to set up three major manufacturing parks including one in Hyderabad, with an investment of Rs. 1,000 crore each to help drive import substitution of basic raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and the making of medical devices, Mr. Vaghela said. Addressing a webinar to commemorate the 77th anniversary of CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT), the Secretary said there had to be renewed focus on bringing together research institutions, academia and the industry to identify new chemicals, update processes and discover new drug delivery systems. ‘Become millionaires’ He said current approval processes were archaic and that there was a dire need to strengthen institutions and recognise scientists’ role in new discoveries, and to help them commercialise the projects so they too can ‘become millionaires’. The Centre has so far received 13 requests for setting up the bulk drug parks. CSIR-DG Shekhar C. Mande said about 53 APIs had been identified for manufacture, of which 26 were being processed on a war footing, with results expected in 2-3 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/centre-formulating-rd-policy-to-bolster-drug-discovery/article32281190.ece

Revenue from operations rose to Rs. 491 crore, from Rs. 389 crore. It also sold 2% stake, amounting to Rs. 363 crore, in its subsidiary, Coromandel International Ltd., to reduce high-cost debt. “The operations of the company were relatively less affected on account of the lockdowns due to COVID-19 as sugar industry could operate under the essential products category,” S. Suresh, MD, EID Parry, said in a statement. “We were able to export around 40,000 MT under the Maximum Admissible Export Quota scheme, which also helped in better cash flow and profitability,” he said. Rane Brake posts loss Rane Brake Lining Ltd., a leading manufacturer of brake linings, disc pads and clutch facings, reported a net loss of about Rs. 6.9 crore during the first quarter ended June 2020 due to truncated period of operations. The company posted a net profit of Rs. 7.3 crore registered in the corresponding year-earlier period. During the period under review, a large portion of working days was lost due to the lockdown. As such, the results for Q1 FY21 are not comparable with the corresponding period of the previous year, Rane said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/eid-parry-returns-to-profit-nets-rs-226-cr/article32281200.ece

It was a profitable period before the break for the tourists as an imperious Babar (52 batting) and opener Shan Masood (45 batting) sought to make a big total after Pakistan elected to bat. In the first session, the England bowlers beat the bat at will and picked up the wickets of Abid Ali (16) and Azhar Ali (0).

06 August 2020||KOZHIKODE,||Sanju ready for IPL after ‘tough training’||On Sanju Samson’s Twitter handle, there is a three-second video that could bring a smile in these depressing times. You would find a young, bearded Christian priest, in white flowing robes, bowling slow left-arm orthodox to the dashing batsman. You would be impressed by the turn the priest extracts from a road of a pitch – literally – just as you would be by the video's background. The visuals are from a training session Sanju had in Kollam, a place he had driven to recently from his home in Thiruvananthapuram after a lockdown was declared in the capital following a COVID-19 spike. “For the last 15 weeks, I had regular sessions of batting, running and gym and I didn't want the lockdown to affect me,” Sanju told The Hindu over phone. “Fortunately, my friend has an academy at Kollam with adequate facilities and there were also people like Fr. Rebeiro to bowl at me.” Sanju is delighted that he would soon be able to find out how the sessions – “the hardest training schedule ever” – have helped him. “Like every cricketer, I have been eagerly waiting for the IPL to start. I think it would lift the spirits of not just the players but that of the entire country and the rest of the cricketing world.” He wants to win matches for Rajasthan Royals. “In T20 cricket, you have to score quickly and that’s what I have been doing in the IPL over the years. “You can't waste 10 balls when Virat Kohli is padded up to bat next.” Sanju thinks the wickets in the UAE could be a bit slow. “We have to play so many matches on three grounds, but they should be good enough for batting.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sanju-ready-for-ipl-after-tough-training/article32281640.ece

Now, 26-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman Srikar Bharat is gunning for a slot in the touring party for the Test series in Australia, which begins later this year. He tells The Hindu that he is “not thinking or worrying about selection”, but his objective is clear: “The goal is obviously to make it to the Indian squad for the forthcoming Australian tour.” Bharat is working towards this goal by “preparing like there is always an opportunity coming my way”. “Thanks to the Andhra Cricket Association, I have been training at the Test match centre here, following all the safety guidelines,” he says. “I am preparing to face the challenges which will come my way at the highest competitive level. My job is to do well for any team and in any format.” Bharat is ready if other, sudden opportunities arise. “Honestly, I am also mentally gearing up for any call by any IPL franchise in case they need a replacement for any reason,” he says. “I am working a lot on my step-out game against the spinners. Now, I feel more confident in this aspect. I do believe that I have the range of strokes against pacers,” he explains. “Fitness, too, is a top priority, for the captain Virat Kohli himself sets a great example.” Bharat, who has been a consistent performer in domestic cricket and for India-A, believes his game has evolved. He says that he has learnt a lot from NCA head Rahul Dravid. “There is a lot of maturity and understanding of my game, of how I should respond to the team’s needs in a given situation,” he says. “Thanks to Dravid sir’s advice. I am ready to bat in any position in the middle-order.”  I am mentally gearing up for a call by any IPL franchisee in case they need a replacement||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/srikar-bharat-eyeing-a-spot-on-indias-australia-tour/article32281581.ece

Ireland never looked intimidated in its chase as Stirling smashed 142 (128b, 9x4, 6x6) and Balbirnie 113 (112b, 12x4), with their 214-run association for the second wicket helping the team reach the target with one delivery to spare. Ireland raced along in its reply, aided by a poor length from the home bowlers, with Stirling reaching his ninth ODI century and Balbirnie his sixth. Ireland’s only other victory over England had come at the 2011 World Cup when it scored 329 for seven with Kevin O’Brien making a century. He was at the crease to hit the winning runs in this latest victory.  The scores : England 328 in 49.5 overs lost to Ireland 329 for three in 49.5 overs (Paul Stirling 142, Andy Balbirnie 113, Harry Tector 29 n.o.).

06 August 2020||Chennai,||Ageless Dhoni still ‘Hungry like the Wolf’||‘Hungry like the Wolf’ — a chartbuster from that popular band Duran Duran in 1982. Mahendra Singh Dhoni was born just a year earlier in 1981. Yet, the visceral connection — raw with brutal predatory instincts — connects the two. At 39, Dhoni still remains the ‘ultimate finisher’ in the game. Now, this ageless cricketer of speed and power will lead Chennai Super Kings — IPL’s most consistent franchise and among its leading successful teams — in yet another quest for glory, this time in the UAE. CSK is a “Dad’s army” that finds match-winners game after game and it has the right ingredients — big hitters, all-rounders, dangerous floaters and as many as three leg-spinners. “We are likely to assemble in Chennai and will leave for the UAE after August 20 like the other teams. We will be based in Dubai. We will have three weeks of practice ahead of the tournament on September 19,” said the side’s affable CEO K.S. Viswanathan, who has also been having conversations with Dhoni. Rusty “The boys will be rusty having played so little cricket. Dhoni would have been happy with another week’s practice but it cannot be helped,” Viswanathan revealed. And since eight teams will be training in three grounds — Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah — practice matches may not be possible. Despite all this, CSK plans to hit the ground running. Dhoni allows his explosive men to express themselves. He makes demands of his cricketers without appearing to put them under pressure. And he makes his smart moves, closing an angle on the field, ringing in an exceptional bowling change — here you can expect the unexpected — or shuffling the batting order. While he gets his cricketers into a relaxed frame of mind, Dhoni ensures their intensity levels never drop. Out of nowhere, this team can move in swiftly for the kill. No wonder, after its period of exile, CSK made a stunning triumphant return and then came within a whisker of the title last season. Depth and options The side has even more depth and options this year. Combative left-arm seamer and free-wheeling batsman, Sam Curran is a welcome addition while Josh Hazlewood’s accuracy, pace, swing and cut prompted Richard Hadlee to name him as the finest contemporary paceman. And Piyush Chawla, immensely successful in IPL, is a leg-spinner with variations and heart. Like its skipper, CSK has its own pace and rhythm, with match-winners galore from Suresh Raina to Ambati Rayudu, Shane Watson to Dwayne Bravo, Imran Tahir to Harbhajan Singh. Then there is the big daddy, Dhoni. Still ‘Hungry like the Wolf’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ageless-dhoni-still-hungry-like-the-wolf/article32281420.ece
06 August 2020||HYDERABAD,||Dronacharya Award can act as great motivation, says Nagraj||For the fifth consecutive year, renowned tennis coach C.V. Nagraj is keeping his fingers crossed in anticipation of a Dronacharya Award. The 59-year-old, who has been running The School of Power Tennis Academy, thanks to the unstinted support from the South Central Railway, on the RRC premises in Secunderabad for the last 23 years, believes he has the credentials to be a strong contender, having produced five Davis Cuppers from his stable – Susheel Narla, J. Vishnuvardhan, Punna Vishal, Saketh Myneni and Mukund Sasikumar. Nagraj has been one of the most low-profile tennis coaches, having also produced four Senior National champions. The Sports Authority of Telangana State has recommended his name this time around after attempts by the All India Tennis Association in the previous years went in vain. “It’s not that I have been coaching to get these awards. But the fact that I am qualified to at least apply keeps me going,” he says. “Honestly, I am not sure what factors ultimately decide the eventual awardees. But don’t I deserve this,” he asks in a choked voice. For someone who has been moulding young talent consistently for more than two decades, Nagraj says he will definitely be pleased if he gets Dronacharya recognition. “It means great motivation. Since I am only too small an individual, I can only hope,” he says. Nagraj received the Dilip Bose Award given by the AITA in 2014 for the best coach in tennis. “Don’t I deserve a higher award this time around?” is his polite query.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dronacharya-award-can-act-as-great-motivation-says-nagraj/article32281579.ece

The best thing in Dubai is you don't have logistical problems. It is 45 minutes from Dubai to Abu Dhabi, if you go from there to Sharjah, it's 40 minutes. In a way, we will have more rest and more time to plan things,” Raina added. The 33-year-old — the highest run-getter for CSK and second highest in the IPL overall — said that players will need to be in a good mental space, given that they are playing after such a long break. “It will be very, very interesting to see how players are thinking because of the circumstances… a lot of protocols. I believe all the [COVID-19] tests will be done before the IPL and we will be in a good frame of mind since we have been sitting at home for the last five months. Everyone is going to enjoy the game and when you enjoy the game you will have the best sporting event.” Harmanpreet said she was looking forward to the Women's T20 Challenge. “I hope we play good cricket and entertain everybody.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/heat-humidity-sandstorms-raina-ready-for-uae/article32281342.ece

06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Don’t want to miss out on a Slam main draw: Nagal||The 2019 US Open holds special memories for Sumit Nagal. The youngster got through qualifying, drew Roger Federer for his Grand Slam debut and even took a set off the Swiss maestro under the glitzy New York night sky at the packed Arthur Ashe Stadium. This time around, there will neither be Federer nor the boisterous crowd, but for Nagal, who at World No. 127 is the last direct entrant into the main draw, the allure of the Major remains. India’s best-ranked singles player could still choose to remain in Europe – his current training base – and play on his beloved clay until the French Open in late September. But after starting at the ATP Challenger in Prague in two weeks’ time, he is set to cross the Atlantic, even as COVID-19 shows no signs of abating in the United States. “I looked into that [staying in Europe], but when you make it into the main draw of a Slam, you don't want to miss out,” Nagal told The Hindu . “It’s going to be different [without fans]. But a Slam is a Slam and if I win a round it will be a huge achievement because I haven’t done it before.” The near-five-month break had prepared him well, the 22-year-old felt. “For the first time in a long time I had so much time to practise. I have worked a lot on my serve and focused on those areas where I had injuries in the past. [It was] more like a ‘prehab’ than rehab. “And then, when you find out that the tour is restarting and you are going to be competing soon, it gives you energy, a bit of adrenaline. So I have been very motivated in the last few weeks.” But Nagal isn’t aiming for the sky. “I have no expectations. It’s not going to be easy for anyone [because of the break]. I am starting on clay and will be focusing more on that surface. But once I am in New York, I am going to compete freely. I have nothing to lose.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dont-want-to-miss-out-on-a-slam-main-draw-nagal/article32281339.ece
06 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Apurvi, Anjum, Ankur in the reckoning for Khel Ratna||Apurvi Chandela had a brilliant 2019, and believes that she has a strong case for the Khel Ratna award. The 27-year-old from Jaipur, who was nominated by the State, holds the final world record in women’s air rifle. She shot 252.9 for the gold in the World Cup in Munich, her second gold, following the one at home in the Delhi World Cup last year. Interestingly, Apurvi’s record is better than Yu Haonan of China’s world record for the men’s event by 0.1 point. She had top scores in all the four World Cups of the season. She finished fourth in Beijing.  Second Indian woman The World Cup gold medals in women’s air rifle by Apurvi only the second Indian woman after Anjali Bhagwat’s success in 2003. Incidentally, Anjali is the only Indian woman shooter to have won the Khel Ratna. Last year, in the World Cup Final, Apurvi won the mixed silver with Zhang Changhong of China. The Commonwealth Games gold medallist in 2014, Apurvi won the mixed team medals in the last Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast and the Asian Games in Palembang. “It is every player’s dream to be honoured with the prestigious Khel Ratna, as it is the highest sporting honour,” said Apurvi. Back from injury She is pleased with her recovery to top level performance after the Rio Olympics, in which she was not at her best due to an injury. Apurvi made her mark in the World Championship in 2018 in which she was placed fourth in clinching the Olympic quota along with silver medallist Anjum Moudgil. The two were also part of the silver winning team. Anjum, who won two mixed gold last year in World Cups, and double trap world champion Ankur Mittal, are also in the race for the Khel Ratna.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/apurvi-anjum-ankur-in-the-reckoning-for-khel-ratna/article32281501.ece
06 August 2020||Bengaluru,||Some leading Indian golfers in a quandary||Indian golfers who feature only on the Asian Tour and Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI) are stranded in a tough spot, with no tournament action on the horizon. The likes of S. Chikkarangappa, Khalin Joshi, Rashid Khan and several others stand to lose prize money earnings, and more crucially, ranking points in the race to qualify for the Olympics. Shubhankar Sharma and Anirban Lahiri, the only Indians on the restarted European and PGA Tours respectively, have a big advantage over their countrymen in this regard. “Not being able to play tournaments is a big concern. If Shubhankar or Anirban have a few good weeks in Europe and USA, they will earn enough ranking points to qualify for the Olympics. I have nothing against them , but I’m disappointed that I cannot do anything to improve my own situation,” Chikkarangappa told The Hindu.  Rashid, India’s top-ranked golfer, faces a similar dilemma. Like many other Indians, Rashid last competed in March (Bandar Malaysia Open), just before COVID-19 concerns forced the Asian Tour to come to a standstill. Ready to risk it Khalin, meanwhile, is desperate to get back into championship action. So much so that Khalin is not concerned about the risk of contracting COVID-19 during travel or tournament play. “If a tournament starts tomorrow, I will not hesitate to play. I could contract COVID-19 even while sitting at home; no place is entirely safe. In this situation, it is better to travel and play tournaments. My earnings have dropped to zero; my ranking is going to go down. Those of us who are not playing in Europe or USA are badly affected. We have no confirmation yet on when the Asian Tour and PGTI will resume. It may restart only in 2021,” Khalin said.  Chikkarangappa explained that a possible solution is for the Asian Tour to identify one safe venue and conduct back-to-back tournaments there. “This is what is being done on the European Tour. With the Olympic qualification window ending on June 21 next year, it is a race against time,” Chikkarangappa stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/some-leading-indian-golfers-in-a-quandary/article32281332.ece
06 August 2020||SAN FRANCISCO,||Koepka confident of a three-peat at PGA C’ship||A confident Brooks Koepka said on Tuesday he had ironed out the kinks that hindered his game earlier this year and added that he will claim a third consecutive PGA Championship this week if he plays at the level he is capable of. “I feel very confident in myself,” he told reporters at TPC Harding Park. “I don’t put any expectations on myself. Just go out and play golf exactly like I know how and, if I do that, then yeah I probably should win.” The four-time Major winner and former World No. 1 said he was more comfortable playing on the sport’s biggest stages because he thrives under pressure. “The way the golf course sets up eliminates pretty much half the guys, and then from there half of those guys probably won’t play well. Then from there I feel like mentally I can beat them, the other half, so you’ve probably got ten guys. That’s the way I see it.” Tiger Woods, grouped with Rory McIlroy and World No. 1 Justin Thomas, is seeking his 16th Major and fifth PGA Championship title, but is an underdog given the concerns about how his surgically-repaired back will react to the cool weather.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/koepka-confident-of-a-three-peat-at-pga-cship/article32281335.ece

06 August 2020||Kochi,||Pokkali rice seedlings travel from Kerala to the Sunderbans||Two farmers in South 24 Parganas district in West Bengal are betting on the pokkali variety of rice from Kerala to tide over a crisis-like situation created by severe seawater incursion into paddy fields in vast areas of the Sundarbans after cyclone Amphan hit West Bengal on May 20. The pokkali variety, known for its saltwater resistance, flourishes in the paddy fields of coastal Alappuzha, Ernakulam and Thrissur districts. The uniqueness of the rice has brought it the Geographical Indication (GI) tag and is the subject of continuing research. Ramkumar Mandal and Khudiram Halder, who have brought about 30 cents of land under pokkali sowing on an experimental basis, said from their village in Mathurapur Block-2 that they heard of the saltwater resistant pokkali rice through the Breakthrough Science Society, which has science clubs in the Sundarbans. Eminent physicist Soumitro Banerjee of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) in Kolkata, who is a member of the science society, said that pokkali rice had been in the news because of its uniqueness and also because a group of people in Kerala have been trying to revive the cultivation of that variety in the State. Dr. Banerjee said the science society was aware of the problem facing the Sundarbans farmers and it was decided that pokkali seeds could be tried out as saltwater incursion had been quite serious in vast areas of the Sundarbans. Mr. Mandal said that about 80% of the rice paddies in the Sundarbans faced the problem of saltwater incursion and if the pokkali experiment succeeded, it would be a good step to turn around the fortunes of the farmers. He said that the seedlings were doing well so far. Vytilla-11 variety Five kilos of Vyttila-11 variety of pokkali seedlings were sent by post by Francis Kalathungal, who is part of the Pokkali Samrakshana Samithi, which has been at the vanguard of a movement to revive pokkali cultivation and prevent it from dying out. He said on Tuesday that the success of the experiment in the Sunderbans will be a big boost to pokkali cultivation even in Kerala. Vyttila-11 is the latest variety to come out of Kerala Agricultural University’s field station in Vyttila, said Dr. A. K. Sreelatha of the Rice Research Station. She said that Vyttila-11 promises better yield of about 5 tonnes per hectare than the previous varieties, and is crossed with the Jyoti variety of rice popular in Kerala. The crop duration is about 110 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-life/pokkali-rice-seedlings-travel-from-kerala-to-the-sunderbans/article32281331.ece

06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||In continuum||The lockdown and its companion, isolation, mean different things to different people. For creatives, this situation has triggered responses that vary across genres, much like any crisis in history. Artistic language has seen a slow shift to a vocabulary that has never existed before: Held — The Lockdown in Words and Images is one such compendium presented by Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan, Chennai, that captures the ‘new normal’ through an amalgam of art and poetry. The digital exhibit, uploaded in four installments, presents an interesting marriage of genres that encapsulate the responses of four artistes: visual artist and poet Annanya Dasgupta, poet Geetanjali Rajan, visual artist and poet Parvathi Nayar and poet K Srilata. Comprising poemages, photopoetry, photo art and words, the ongoing project relies heavily on collaboration. The first bout of the nation-wide lockdown was a “shock” for the artists. Though the first few days were spent grappling with the changing situation, Paravathi Nayar says, “Later, I was literally found lingering near windows and looking out; becoming conscious of this position of being on a threshold, a windowsill of time.” Through the window, she could see the playground, once filled with children’s laughter, was now empty: “The playground seemed like a large sundial, marking the moving time. And, I started taking photographs.” Her photo poem, five windows, took form then; this was also the seed of the collaboration. Just ahead of the lockdown, Srilata went on a birdwatching trip near Kelambakkam. She recalls the flock of migratory birds that visited the marshes: “Everything seemed so normal. It painted a picture that said, ‘everything’s going to be okay with this world!’. For me, the shift was very dramatic.” Her poemOur Days Would Catch on the Cruellest Thornsencapsulates the response to an unfathomable shift. Shift in perspective Anannya Dasgupta’s photo art series, Lockdown Vocabulary, has images coupled with words associated with the times. For instance, under the title A to Z of PPE is the image of a mask merged with inscriptions on silver tablet strips. Geetanjali, who writes in the tradition of Japanese haikai , reflects on fleeting moments. Her poems are “reminders of the transience of everything”. The first haiga in the series came from observing a furrow on a mother’s forehead that was not there earlier, she writes. The medium is what aided the collaboration. “Geetanjali and I are primarily people who work with words, whereas Annanya and Parvathi have worked with both words and images. In the process, I was able to reflect on what happens to a poem when it’s set to an image. Annanya spent days and nights working on each of the poems, reading and understanding them closely and setting them to images,” says the poet. Annanya also helped meld photographs for Geetanjali’s haikai : the format captures the shift in perspective as time goes by. Parvathi says though there are plans to give the collection a physical form, by what means, is still uncertain owing to the times.

06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||It’s raining EPs||Bedroom pop gets its name not from the cosy, lazy vibe of the genre, but from the fact that it is DIY. No studio recordings, no elaborate collaborations, just heartfelt music made by one artiste in his own room, maybe with some help from friends. So “bedroom pop” is how 19-year-old Ashwin Iyer describes his maiden EP, the two-track Poetry On A Bus , that might just lull you to sleep for all the right reasons. On the other hand, Alvin Presley’s first-ever EP Fall Today follows a starkly different vibe and line of emotion: he managed to wrangle in one studio recording before the lockdowns began. For a début project, the four-track EP does a solid job of serving up a sound that is its own. A hint of melancholy permeates, and Alvin’s soulful notes are made more urgent by bursts of percussion — most noticeably in the first few minutes of the track ‘Fallen Mornings’. No track is evenly intense: the pulse quickens and slackens multiple times, almost by the minute. The near-psychedelic ending of ‘Falling star ( Pogathey )’, for instance, is a very good moment to lose yourself in. Many instruments go into creating each mood, which makes the fact that Alvin did most of it himself more impressive. “It is an alternative, folk, pop, R&B, progressive mixture... All the elements that have inspired me, that I like most when playing, I have put into this,” says Alvin, “I began working on it — mixing, mastering, production, everything — in January, and was at it till July. Only one of the songs, called ‘Falling Star’, was written a couple of years ago.” In contrast, Ashwin’s Poetry On A Bus was the work of a single, neat month. “Both songs took less than a month... I was never putting out music like this [at this pace] before,” says Ashwin, a student at KM Music Conservatory. His creations are the work of many minds, and he is more than happy to give credit. “The main collaborator is Pratyush Shankar, who I also work with for my band PA Systems. Pratyush usually writes the songs and sings them... he comes up with a narrative, a story to tell, and I weave the music around it,” he says. The rainy-day vibe, he says, came from an amalgamation of influences, from Chennai-based The F16s to a number of Western artistes. Guitarist Hrday Sunil and bassist Prashanth Venkat also added to it: the result sits at the crossroads of bluesy and sunlit breezy.  Poetry On A Bus seems to have caught imaginations even beyond the city circuit, but it is not the only collaboration in recent times to have caused a stir. Kevin Paul aka Mr Kev’s lockdown album Quarantino is a gift that keeps on giving: especially its most recent release ‘Inbam Pongum Velai’. Made in collaboration with Chennai artiste Anand Kashinath and featuring vocals by — wait for it — Benny Dayal, the track is a quintessential love song at its core, with just a touch of Mr Kev’s zany style. Says Mr Kev, “The Tamil lyrics are by Anand; he and I also did the backup vocals. It is hard to say exactly how many days it took, because there were many tracks I worked on simultaneously in my 12 days of self-quarantine.” Though the base was formed then, improvements are a constant process, and the plan is to release one song each month.  It is an alternative, folk, pop, R&B, progressive mixture Alvin Presley||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/its-raining-eps/article32281172.ece
06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Shepherd in the sky||Between COVID-19 and swarms of locusts that found their way into India, the drones have emerged winners. “The situation has put us in the forefront and not just spiked the interest of the general public but stakeholders too,” says Smit Shah of the Drone Federation of India, a non-Government, not-for-profit, industry-led body that promotes and strives towards building a safer and scalable unmanned aviation industry. Recent work put in by these electronic flying devices — in surveillance, to check if people are adhering to lockdown, as well as disinfecting and sanitising — has brought them visibility. In fact, the pandemic and pestilence have pushed this sector to further innovate. Senthil Kumar, professor and director, Dr Kalam Advanced UAV Research Centre, MIT, Anna University, is now working on flying a swarm of 20 drones with a single operator. “In the case of disinfecting during the pandemic, if you programme the swarm, then each drone can spread out to different streets and get the job done at the same time,” explains Kumar. He adds that drones are useful in fighting locusts, with pesticides. “If lakhs of locusts come in, one drone may not be enough. But a swarm can effectively fight them.” Driving innovation Drones are primarily battery-operated, but Kumar designed a dual-powered drone (petrol and battery-operated) in 2018. This year, these hybrid drones were deployed, for the first time, to battle locusts in Rajasthan. A few were also used by the Tamil Nadu Police, on a trial basis, for surveillance and making announcements in containment zones. Battery-powered drones are not suitable for bigger payloads: in the case of tackling locusts they need to carry 15 litres of pesticides, says Kumar. Then there are safety issues: if the battery blasts when the drone is mid air, it will crash. “Keeping these factors in mind, we designed these hybrid drones, after researching for five years,” he adds. These machines carry 16 to 18 litres of pesticide for spraying. Plus, each can hold three-and-a-half litres of petrol and the overall weight of the drone at full capacity is 45 kilograms. It can fly for 40 minutes. In another positive development, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has recently sanctioned engine-operated drones to fly at night. This permission is specifically to deal with locusts. “In Bikaner (Rajasthan) our three drones are working at night, spraying chemicals to tackle locusts,” says Kumar, who has 50-plus drones. “The Ministry of Civil Aviation has been working effectively during this COVID-19 period. They have taken a lot of effort with regard to drones and this will result in many players coming into this segment,” says Kumar, adding, “Big industries will join too, especially if the agriculture field is open. It will create a lot of employment opportunity.” Lately, the involvement of the drones in relief work, says Smit, has made securing permissions from the Government a little easier. A case in point is the GARUD portal (Government Authorisation for Relief Using Drones) that was recently set up to fast track large scale, quick permissions for COVID-19-related drone operations, says Smit. He also lists the DigitalSky Platform — by the Ministry of Civil Aviation — a single window clearance platform for all drone related registration, permission and other regulatory services. Branching out It has been established that drones can be used for a lot more than just shooting weddings and films. “Today, we have 38 different solutions that they offer. These include mosquito repellents, locusts, mapping, electricity wire survey, sanitisation...” says Agnishwar Jayaprakash who started Chennai-based Garuda Aerospace in 2015. His company is now almost a veteran in the sanitisation scene. It has worked in around 16 cities across India, spraying disinfectants and covered nearly 25,000 acres. “We began in March, with the Health Ministry of Tamil Nadu giving us an order for the Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital in Chennai,” says Agnishwar, whose drones then subsequently worked in Varanasi, Bhopal, Chandigarh, Rourkela, Ranchi, Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh, Nirmal in Telangana, and Mumbai. “Now the Government understands that automation and drone technology can serve as replacement for on-ground health and sanitation workers,” says Agni, whose company was also roped in to tackle locusts by the Department of Agriculture in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. “We were one of the first responders to use this technology to kill locusts,” Agnishwar says, explaining that they have two methods. One is to spray a night before the locusts arrive and the second is to target them from above when they are foraging. “We have a 70-75% hit ratio.” he adds. These drones, each weighing 25 kilograms, carry 15 to 20 kilograms of liquid solution provided by the Government. Looking forward, Agnishwar’s company has now developed a drone delivery platform for food and e-commerce. It’s called IPPO (meaning ‘now’ in Tamil) and is in talks with service providers like Zomato, Flipkart and Amazon among others. “Whenever the Government regulations open up (air traffic rules for drones), we will be the first in the country to do this,” he says. With this service, even a 20-kilometre radius can be covered in 15 minutes. He also plans to have his own cloud kitchens. With increasing dependence on drones, Agnishwar says, “Today, the drone industry is where the e-commerce industry was in 2009. Over the next couple of years, we will grow.”  Today, we have 38 different solutions that drones offer. These include mosquito repellents, mapping, electricity wire survey...

06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Gogo Chai||If you crave crisp, onion pakoras and chai every time it rains, you are not alone. When Ashvin Rajagopalan, who runs Ashvita, woke up to a cloudy, wet day, he asked his restaurant cooks to make a batch of pakoras , and sent out pictures to friends and customers via WhatsApp. They were sold out by tea time. And, that is how GoGo Chai was born. The brand is Ashvin’s second lockdown launch. “Our first COVID-19 baby was GoGo Desi,” he says wryly. “We, like many others, were severely hit by the pandemic and lockdown. And, we continue to be hit,” he says. Realising that many people have lost jobs or taken paycuts, but still need to order meals sometimes, he launched GoGo Desi from a separate, vegetarian kitchen in June, focussing on competitively priced home-style food like dal , parathas and okra fry. “The response has been great, because this is home cooking. In fact, this is the exact same food I eat at home everyday,” he says. With WFH, Ashvin realised that there was another opportunity: a brand centred around chai time, running only from 3pm to 5 pm. “We are trying to see what the market is like — surprisingly it is huge,” he says. After the onion pakora success, he tried Kerala’s pazham pori (Rs. 100 per box), following his mother-in-law’s recipe, resulting in pleasingly crisp edges and sweet, steamy interiors. Then came chilli bajjis , oozing cheese (Rs. 125). Although GoGo Chai officially launches in September, try these snacks via GoGo Desi, as the team builds the chai menu. Meanwhile, Ashvin is working on convincing his aunt to share her legendary masala vadai recipe with his cooks.

06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Knot online now||Ulageswari R is a dreamer. She has always wanted to have a lavish wedding, one with thousands of friends and family taking part in elaborate ceremonies. She was engaged to Sivavallinathan A in February, and they were to be married on June 10. They had even booked Chennai's popular multi-purpose hall, Kalaignar Arangam, as their wedding mandapam . But then, the pandemic and ensuing lockdown arrived. Ulageswari and family had to re-think their options. They decided to retain the wedding date, but changed the venue to their residence on Chennai’s East Coast Road. A friend was roped in to help with decorations in their parking area. When they tied the knot, there were 30 in attendance, in person. But several hundreds joined in virtually, through a special app and website that they had created with the help of Chennai-based Wedding Wishlist. “I have no regrets, and it was a beautiful four-hour ceremony during which we did not rush through rituals. Nor did I have to keep smiling at random people throughout,” recalls Ulageswari, an ENT surgeon whose low-key online wedding also cut her expenditure to one-fifth of her original budget. Hers is the first of ‘virtual weddings’ in her family. Elsewhere, across Chennai and other parts of India, it is a phenomenon fast catching up. Kanika Subbiah, Founder of Wedding Wishlist, vouches for that. Her company had zero requests for weddings in March and April, months during which everyone was unsure about the way going forward. Things picked up in May. “Couples started realising they could not wait indefinitely to get married; the answer lay in hosting celebrations that were safe and waste-free,” says Kanika, whose company helped in putting together 14 virtual weddings in June and about 20 in July. For this month, they have a lineup of almost one virtual wedding a day. Caught in the web Families planning these weddings are increasingly leveraging technology. But that comes with its own challenges: couples began to miss the social interactions with guests, one of the best parts of any Indian wedding. “Live stream only allows passive viewing, but with virtual weddings, we try to deliver the entire wedding experience online. The couple’s website becomes the virtual hub, the online version of ‘ shaadi ka ghar’ ,” she adds. In addition to watching a live webcast, guests can also attend online parties, share photos with other invitees and partake in pre-wedding functions like bachelor parties and bridal showers. All this might seem easy for people clued in to technology, but not for those, for whom the word ‘online’ is still a bit foreign. That is where the role of a usher, priced at Rs. 4,999 per wedding, comes into play. Tanvi Saraf of Wedding Wishlist has already played that role for six weddings now. She was the equivalent of a person who welcomes guests at the reception, in a pre-COVID wedding. “I give guests a sense of the flow of events, so that they know what to expect. Even as there is a live stream happening, we create separate virtual rooms for different sections of the guests, so that nobody is lost. When you have 200 guests on a Zoom call, most of whom you don't know, it becomes a little uncomfortable to talk to all,” says Tanvi. Her job also entails hosting guests in separate virtual rooms, with people they can converse with. “I also help elders who might not be too tech-savvy but are very interested in watching the proceedings.” Music on the house One of the first things that Tarini Arun Kumar and Raashid Navlahi, based out of Bangalore, thought about when putting together their wedding was the music it would feature. “We’re both big fans of Bollywood music. We imagined all our friends abroad and family coming in, and having a big party,” recalls Tarini, who works in the spirits industry. That was not to be due to the lockdown. But the virtual sangeet they put forth a week before their wedding in June, more than compensated for it. “I thought it would be just a virtual get-together, but I was surprised to see that some friends had roped in DJ Jasmeet from Bangalore for it. He suddenly popped on the screen, had a fun DJ-like background and played for a solid hour.” The music, which included popular Bollywood numbers like ‘Chogada’ and remixes of ‘Channa Mereya’, not only got the couple dancing but also their 40-plus friends from across the globe who had joined them virtually. “It was as if we were all together. It was crazy,” she exclaims. Chennai-based ‘Kalyanamalai’ TV Mohan describes these changing times in the wedding industry as “revolutionary”. Known for his Tamil matrimonial ‘Kalyanamalai’ on Sun TV — a show that introduces prospective brides and grooms accompanied by their parents — Mohan says, “Connections between family members and the creation of new families are necessary to help us stay in touch with the human in us. Virtual weddings, which are on the rise now, are helping families experience this in ways we didn’t even think was possible a few years, or even months, ago.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/knot-online-now/article32281177.ece
06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Seasons in the sun||The landline rings a couple of times before it is answered; it is not often that you have a Mr Bond say that he was expecting your call. It is a Landour kind of day — brilliant sunshine filters through the dancing keyholes of the deodar’s dark-green, needle-shaped leaves. After a night of lashing rain, the room on the roof has flooded and the morning has been spent mopping up, I am told. Ruskin Bond, 86, has spent nearly 70 years wielding his pen — he is one of India’s most prolific writers, a staple for children, a recipient of Sahitya Akademi, Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan awards, and a mascot for nostalgia. “There’s quite a bit of traffic on the road below. But the valley’s landscape is unchanged and the mornings are still full of birdsong,” says Bond, of the view from his window. It is this hypnotic appeal of recasting life for today’s reader even while looking back with love, of painting a picture of clouds boiling up from the valley even as cars fishtail up the steep hills, that has ensured Bond has survived the tidal shifts of Indian writing in English. Revisiting boyhood In A Song Of India (published by Penguin) which comes after Looking For The Rainbow, Till The Clouds Roll By and Coming Round The Mountain — all beautifully illustrated by Mihir Joglekar — Bond, who is of British descent, travels the arc of his boyhood.  The separation of his parents; a magical year with his father in Delhi; his schooldays at Bishop Cotton, Shimla, where he was part of a mischievous gang of boys called the Fearsome Four; the death of his father when he was 10 that forever left a hole in his heart; his independent streak when he went to live with his mother and her new family in Dehradun; losing his friends to Partition; the friendships with boys from his hometown that have survived; the many loves who flitted in and out of his life even while he never summoned the courage to act; and the year he went away at 16 to the Channel Islands in the UK to find a new life fill the pages. “I have a vivid memory of my boyhood,” says Bond. “I did keep a diary but it got me into trouble at school. My childhood in Jamnagar, where my father was employed by the Jam Saheb, resulted in friendships with children across backgrounds. It was a different milieu when my mother married a Punjabi Hindu. After Partition, my Muslim friends left and Sikh friends took their place. I settled here in 1964 and the years have merged. But my boyhood stands apart.”  A Song of India that follows is a tribute that is warm with detail without being overwhelming. It is also a lilting love song to the country that has been the love of his life. It is this sense of belonging, a necessary quality for a writer, that makes Bond still relevant. “Strangely enough, kids are still interested in stories set half a century ago, even ghost stories, though it takes a lot to scare them these days. Many write to ask about the girl at Deoli station, a bittersweet story written in 1956.” Falling in love is a constant theme, even if the love never comes to fruition. “I was very vulnerable,” says Bond. “It didn’t take long for me to fall in love even if sometimes it was a one-way thing. With Raj {from A Song Of India whoseparathashe devoured earning him the moniker Paratha Bond} it was more a friendship. I lost touch with her when I left for England.” In the UK, Bond worked four jobs, which he “never saw as careers, although I did consider becoming a tap dancer or a botanist”. He wrote in the evenings and watched Jean Renoir’s The River to tide over homesickness. His debut Room On The Roof won the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial Prize in 1957 and paid for his passage home. “The book would make a fine film,” says Bond, who writes in long-hand almost every morning and is reading Bram Stoker’s Dracula. “But for how long can you get pleasure in biting a lady in the neck?” he laughs. Looking back at how his writing began, Bond says, “16 is an important year for all of us. Perhaps that’s why it stands out.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/seasons-in-the-sun/article32281184.ece
06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||The action begins||Mankatha is not Venkat Prabhu’s favourite game anymore. With COVID-19 and lockdown putting an end to the filmmaker’s sedentary lifestyle, he has taken to walking; he updates his Twitter feed with details of the distance he covers on foot (upto 11 kilometres a day now). “The driving force {for the new fitness regimen} is Praveen KL {film editor},” says Venkat, over phone from his home. The last we saw of Venkat Prabhu, the filmmaker, was four years ago in the sequel to cult classic Chennai 600028 . He has since faced a series of ups and downs; his eighth directorial, Party , produced by T Siva of Amma Creations, was supposed to release in 2018 but is yet to see the light of day. The on-again, off-again venture, Maanaadu , starring Silambarasan, complicated affairs further before COVID-19 outbreak brought the curtains down on its filming in March. Changing course While he waits for the fog on his filmmaking career to lift, Venkat Prabhu has reconnected with something that actually brought him into films: acting. Now, Venkat is set to appear as the antagonist — his first major role in films since Vasantham Vanthachu (2007) — in Lock Up. Bankrolled by actor-turned-producer Nitin Sathyaa, Lock Up also features Vaibhav and Vani Bhojan in lead roles. “It is refreshing to see other filmmakers imagine and write roles specifically for me,” he says. Venkat Prabhu plays a cop — SI Moorthy — in Lock Up . “[Moorthy] is self-centred and crooked. He does something and tries to cover it up by blaming others; the more he lies, the bigger the issue becomes. He is at odds with this constable character {played by Vijay}). It is a very serious film, has its twists and turns and captures the duo’s jealousy and clash of egos,” he says. Sticky wicket Venkat Prabhu will also be seen in an acting capacity in Chimbu Deven’s upcoming film Kasada Thapara . The former is also a co-producer on the film under the aegis of Black Ticket Company, his film production firm. Through the company, Venkat has so far bankrolled three feature films — Chennai 600028 II , Kasada Thapara and RK Nagar ; the last of which released on Netflix during lockdown. While he believes the opening up of OTT platforms are a “blessing in disguise” for small budget productions like Lock Up , he acknowledges that it is a double-edged sword too, especially since revenue share percentages offered to a producer by digital streaming platforms have taken a tumble. “When someone is ready to buy content, it lifts the producer out of debts, even if it means he stands to make no gains from the trade. But some platforms insist on rev-share models with multi-year payment structures.” However, there seems to be a future in betting big on OTT platforms. Venkat Prabhu himself has completed a web series featuring Vaibhav and Kajal Aggarwal for Disney+ HotStar; an announcement on the series is expected soon. Dubbed in multiple languages, Venkat says he has attempted horror with the unnamed web series. “It won’t have the typical jump scares of the horror genre. I’m a big fan of Stranger Things on Netflix, so I have applied a similar treatment,” says the director, adding that it has been filmed keeping in mind tier-2 and tier-3 audiences. The filmmaker notes that Tamil cinema’s reputed actors and technicians too will have to embrace OTT platforms going forward. “There is no bigger challenge or success today than being able to make an audience sit and binge watch 10 episodes of a web series you shot,” he says, before adding with conviction, “I’m sure mindsets will change.”  Lock Upwill stream on Zee 5 from August 14    Maanaadu dropped? The high budget production venture, Maanaadu , which features an ensemble cast including Silambarasan, SJ Suryah, Kalyani Priyadarshan, P Bharathiraja and SA Chandrasekhar among others, went through a roller coaster ride after the producer Suresh Kamatchi and its lead star had a much-publicised, infamous fallout last year. In the end, a compromise was reached and shooting began, only to be suspended 20 days later with COVID-19 outbreak enforcing a lockdown. Of late, it has been rumoured that Venkat Prabhu might be dropping the project. “ Maanaadu is a story that happens around political gatherings. We need crowds in many frames and it has big action sequences. Even if the Government lifts the shooting ban, if they cap the number of people allowed on a set to 70-80 people, how do you shoot a film like Maanaadu ? We were discussing shooting something else with the same team,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-action-begins/article32281145.ece
06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Going once, going twice||On an Instagram post by The Artist Project, featuring a circular acrylic painting of seagulls, a bidding war has ensued in the comments. “4000” comments one user, “4500” says another. “5000” says the third, outbidding the others. In the next three days of posting that painting, it is sold to the highest bidder. Since June, many such paintings have been auctioned from this Instagram account, for this is how Chennai-based architect Abhinaya Rangarajan, founder of the not-for-profit, is raising funds for rural artisans. “The Artist Project was started as an initiative where we work with rural artisans who do not have the access or means to put their work online. Their work may even sell internationally, but it is often the middlemen who earn the most. So we reach out to them, give their work more visibility online, and get them orders so they have a steady source of revenue,” explains Abhinaya. The account had not been very active since mid-2018, until the pandemic hit. “We started receiving requests from the artists we work with, asking us if we could help sell their products,” she adds. Abhinaya says they currently have 10-15 artists in their roster, from across the country: Puducherry, interior parts of Andhra Pradesh, a couple of villages near Jaipur, in the Kutch region and in West Bengal. “Some of them are a lot more active than the rest, and once they manage to sustain their business without our help, we let them be and take on another artist on board.” With the pandemic, says Abhinaya, the hardest hit artists “are those that run small businesses, who sell out of push-carts or tiny stores. They depend on the workshops provided to them by the Government, and rely completely on footfall”. One such artist on board with them is Puducherry-based Muthulakshmi, who does crochet. At 35, Muthulakshmi, who had been trained by a French national in her hometown, started Gokulam Crafts, and now works out of a Government workshop. Through its various auctions so far, The Artist Project raised close to Rs. 22,000 for Muthulakshmi and her family. “Apart from the auctions, we also promote our artists’ works on our account. They are priced between Rs. 300 and a maximum of Rs. 3,000. We realised that fundraising through auctions would be more immediate and effective for now,” she says. For the auctions, many up-and-coming artists have volunteered their work, from Goa-based photographer and painter, Richa Kashlekar to Hyderabad-based Malvika Jey, and Abhinaya herself. “We put up a post of the painting with its details and opening bid, and invite people to bid in the comments for three days,” she explains the process. Sometimes, bidding happens privately. “We then DM to check if it is a legitimate bid.” This week, pottery by Gopal Lal from Kotjevar, Jaipur has been featured. Gopal, who runs a fourth-generation institution that crafts Jaipur-style blue earthenware, has coached and upskilled most of his village. His handpainted animal motif plates are now up for sale.

Tarun Teja and Muralidharan have done the same with AsVINS , a 20-minute horror short about a team of YouTubers entering an abandoned building to rescue a friend who is stuck in a thousand-year-old curse. The entire film was shot in Tarun’s Chennai residence that was was built in 1950s. Murali plays the character of Varun, the only face that appears (through a phone) in the movie. “Almost throughout the movie, Tarun had to hold the phone in one hand, torch light and the GoPro camera in the other hand... at the same time,” says Murali, who is also part of the trilingual film Rocketry: The Nambi Effect , directed by R Madhavan.  AsVINS, which has currently over 200K views with 1,000-plus comments on YouTube, is actually a pilot for an intended feature film the two are planning. “The feature film will be a horror-thriller with a strong connection to Indian mythology,” says Tarun, who has earlier directed several short films, including I Raped Her , S1207 and The Confessor .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/home-run/article32281155.ece

06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Curiouser and curiouser!||There are creepy-crawlies everywhere, despite the monsoon’s start-stop appearance. One of the most common ones are long, elongated cylindrical multiple-legged creatures that appear even in potted plants: millipedes, also called diplopods. Their study is called diplopodology! They do favour moist conditions and are burrowers, however, they venture out in heavy rains, may be due to the excessive water in the ground. As a result, millipedes often end up being inside houses as well. Going by the same logic, even extreme dry outside conditions may lead them straight at your doorstep and inside. Belonging to the group arthropods, they are invertebrates (animals with no back bone) that have an exoskeleton, a pair of antenna, and a segmented body (with various segments) with two pairs of jointed legs per body segment. A layperson may think both millipedes and centipedes look very similar. However, it may help to know the difference as centipedes are mildly venomous (being carnivores, venom is injected to subdue their prey), and their bite can be quite painful and cause mild swelling. While millipedes have two pairs of jointed legs per segment, centipedes have one. The term millipede has been derived from the Latin word millipeda , literally translating to a thousand legs. Contrary to its name, no millipede known (yet) to science has a thousand legs! They come in a variety of shapes and sizes. A city like Delhi sees the usual brown or black ones (like Spinotarsus colosseus and a few others), whereas a few of them might exhibit aposematism by being bright in colour, sending warning signals to predators that it may be toxic and unpalatable. It seems that a lot of predators like birds and lizards wait for the rains to have a diverse diet. Millipedes are often referred to as detritivores that feed on decaying organic matter like leaves and other dead plant matter, thus contributing towards decomposition, cycling nutrients back into the soil, thus aiding in the well-being of an ecosystem. These arthropods are perhaps one of the oldest known land animals from the Silurian times (from the Paleozoic Era) — we know this from fossil evidence. The inability to bite or sting, and its slow-moving nature are reasons for their struggle against predators. Even though this does not leave them with much latitude to protect themselves, there are certain mechanisms that assist them in survival. Its primary defence mechanism is to curl into a tight coil, thereby protecting their legs and other vital delicate areas on the body behind a hard exoskeleton. A few species may emit foul-smelling chemicals to ward off predators. Certain chemicals may even contain toxins that can hurt any potential threat nearby. For instance, the benzoquinone dispensed, is an insect-repellent and monkeys are known to nibble on these millipedes and rub them on their bodies (for the chemical) to evade mosquitoes. These creatures are an integral part of folklore and traditional medicine across the world. Not surprisingly, a few cultures associate them with the onset of the rains. Their intriguing appearance has inspired scientific research, from being model organisms to study arthropods to robotics.

06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Shepherd in the sky||Between COVID-19 and swarms of locusts that found their way into India, the drones have emerged winners. “The situation has put us in the forefront and not just spiked the interest of the general public but stakeholders too,” says Smit Shah of the Drone Federation of India, a non-Government, not-for-profit, industry-led body that promotes and strives towards building a safer and scalable unmanned aviation industry. Recent work put in by these electronic flying devices — in surveillance, to check if people are adhering to the lockdown, as well as disinfecting and sanitising — has brought them visibility. In fact, the pandemic and pestilence have pushed this sector to further innovate. Prof Senthil Kumar, director, Dr Kalam Advanced UAV Research Centre, MIT, Anna University, is now working on flying a swarm of 20 drones with a single operator. “In the case of disinfecting during the pandemic, if you programme the swarm, then each drone can spread out to different streets and get the job done at the same time,” explains Kumar. He adds that drones are useful in fighting locusts, with pesticides. “If lakhs of locusts come in, one drone may not be enough. But a swarm can effectively fight them.” Driving innovation Drones are primarily battery-operated, but Kumar designed a dual-powered drone (petrol and battery-operated) in 2018. This year, these hybrid drones were deployed, for the first time, to battle locusts in Rajasthan. A few were also used by the Tamil Nadu Police, on a trial basis, for surveillance and making announcements in containment zones. Battery-powered drones are not suitable for bigger payloads: in the case of tackling locusts they need to carry 15 litres of pesticides, says Kumar. Then there are safety issues: if the battery blasts when the drone is mid air, it will crash. “Keeping these factors in mind, we designed these hybrid drones, after researching for five years,” he adds. These machines carry 16 to 18 litres of pesticide for spraying. Plus, each can hold three-and-a-half litres of petrol and the overall weight of the drone at full capacity is 45 kilograms. It can fly for 40 minutes. In another positive development, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has recently sanctioned engine-operated drones to fly at night. This permission is specifically to deal with locusts. “In Bikaner (Rajasthan) our three drones are working at night, spraying chemicals to tackle locusts,” says Kumar, who has 50-plus drones. “The Ministry of Civil Aviation has been working effectively during this COVID-19 period. They have taken a lot of effort with regard to drones and this will result in many players coming into this segment,” says Kumar, adding, “Big industries will join too, especially if the agriculture field is open. It will create a lot of employment opportunity.” Lately, the involvement of the drones in relief work, says Smit, has made securing permissions from the Government a little easier. A case in point is the GARUD portal (Government Authorisation for Relief Using Drones) that was recently set up to fast track large scale, quick permissions for COVID-19-related drone operations, says Smit. He also lists the DigitalSky Platform — by the Ministry of Civil Aviation — a single window clearance platform for all drone related registration, permission and other regulatory services. Branching out It has been established that drones can be used for a lot more than just shooting weddings and films. “Today, we have 38 different solutions that they offer. These include mosquito repellents, locusts, mapping, electricity wire survey, sanitisation...” says Agnishwar Jayaprakash who started Chennai-based Garuda Aerospace in 2015. His company is now almost a veteran in the sanitisation scene. It has worked in around 16 cities across India, spraying disinfectants and covered nearly 25,000 acres. “We began in March, with the Health Ministry of Tamil Nadu giving us an order for the Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital in Chennai,” says Agnishwar, whose drones then subsequently worked in Varanasi, Bhopal, Chandigarh, Rourkela, Ranchi, Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh, Nirmal in Telangana, and Mumbai. “Now the Government understands that automation and drone technology can serve as replacement for on-ground health and sanitation workers,” says Agni, whose company was also roped in to tackle locusts by the Department of Agriculture in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. “We were one of the first responders to use this technology to kill locusts,” Agnishwar says, explaining that they have two methods. One is to spray a night before the locusts arrive and the second is to target them from above when they are foraging. “We have a 70-75% hit ratio.” he adds. These drones, each weighing 25 kilograms, carry 15 to 20 kilograms of liquid solution provided by the Government. Looking forward, Agnishwar’s company has now developed a drone delivery platform for food and e-commerce. It’s called IPPO (meaning ‘now’ in Tamil) and is in talks with service providers like Zomato, Flipkart and Amazon among others. “Whenever the Government regulations open up (air traffic rules for drones), we will be the first in the country to do this,” he says. With this service, even a 20-kilometre radius can be covered in 15 minutes. He also plans to have his own cloud kitchens. With increasing dependence on drones, Agnishwar says, “Today, the drone industry is where the e-commerce industry was in 2009. Over the next couple of years, we will grow.”  Today, we have 38 different solutions that drones offer. These include mosquito repellents, mapping, electricity wire survey...

06 August 2020||August 06 2020 00:00 IST,||In continuum||The lockdown and its companion, isolation, mean different things to different people. For creatives, this situation has triggered responses that vary across genres, much like any crisis in history. Artistic language has seen a slow shift to a vocabulary that has never existed before: Held — The Lockdown in Words and Images is one such compendium presented by Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan, Chennai, that captures the ‘new normal’ through an amalgam of art and poetry. online The digital exhibit, uploaded in four instalments, presents an interesting marriage of genres that encapsulate the responses of four artistes: visual artist and poet Annanya Dasgupta, poet Geetanjali Rajan, visual artist and poet Parvathi Nayar, and poet K Srilata. Comprising poemages, photopoetry, photo art and words, the ongoing project relies heavily on collaboration. Though the first few days were spent grappling with the changing situation, Paravathi Nayar says, “Later, I was literally found lingering near windows and looking out; becoming conscious of this position of being on a threshold, a windowsill of time.” Through the window, she could see the playground, once filled with children’s laughter, was now empty: “The playground seemed like a large sundial, marking the moving time. And, I started taking photographs.” Her photo poem, Five Windows, took form; this was also the seed of the collaboration. Ahead of the lockdown, Srilata went on a birdwatching trip. “Everything seemed so normal. It painted a picture that said, ‘everything’s going to be okay with this world!’. For me, the shift was very dramatic.” Her poemOur Days Would Catch on the Cruellest Thornsencapsulates the response to the shift.

06 August 2020||Chandigarh,||Book those directly involved in hooch tragedy for murder: CM||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday directed the State police chief to book those directly involved in the hooch tragedy that has claimed 113 lives, for murder. Promising justice for the victims of the case, which he termed as the biggest tragedy of recent times, the Chief Minister asserted that he will not tolerate any political interference in the case. Capt. Amarinder also mooted enhancement of punishment for spurious or illicit liquor manufacturing and smuggling under the Excise Act, to ensure repeat offenders remain behind the bars and are not able to come out easily to indulge again in the crime. During a Cabinet meeting, several Ministers agreed to Advocate General Atul Nanda’s suggestion that a strict law like Punjab Control of Organised Crime Act (PCOCA) was needed to combat organised crime like illicit liquor smuggling. The Chief Minister asked the sub-committee, set up under Minister Brahm Mohindra, to examine the provisions of the proposed law, to finalise and submit its report at the earliest. He agreed with Sukhjinder Randhawa and other Ministers that PCOCA could help control hardcore criminals and act as a deterrent to gangsters, who continue to deal in organised crime even from prison, and had close connections with terrorists too, according to a government release here.  SIT teams formed Punjab Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta on Wednesday ordered the constitution of two Special Investigation Teams (SITs) to fast-track investigations in all the FIRs registered in the hooch tragedy. Additional Director General of Police (Law & Order) Ishwar Singh will supervise both the SIT investigations. Meanwhile, the Shiromani Akali Dal announced that the party would approach Punjab Governor V.P. Singh Badnore and demand an immediate dismissal of the Congress government in the State, which the party said was responsible for the hooch tragedy. “The Akali Dal will subsequently hold a dharna outside the Governor’s residence for four days from August 7. Also we have decided that in the second phase, the party would hold dharna outside the residence of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi and demand that the Congress high command come clean on the issue,” party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said.

06 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Delhi’s virus slump is no magic pill: experts||With rapidly falling COVID-19 active case load, dipping fatality and positivity rate, and rising number of vacant beds, Delhi is currently among the handful of States/UTs in India that has managed to contain and reverse a growing pandemic load. Delhi has slipped from the top three red zones in the country to the ninth position. While the Central government said it is ready to replicate lessons learnt here in other high burden States, those part of this move point out that Delhi’s dipping COVID-19 numbers is “no magic pill”. Sample this: with a current recovery rate of 90%, Delhi’s active case load at the end of June hovered around 27,847. It has now more than halved, at a little over 10,000 cases. Moreover, from June 22 to 28, the city recorded 448 deaths while this past week it has come down to 177. Delhi is among the 24 States/UTs that have better tests per million than the national average of 15,119. The Capital is clocking 57,855 tests per million, second to Goa which tests 84,927 per million. “This is a result of micro planning, scrupulous implementation, and sustained emphasis on testing, tracking and treating,” said a senior Central government official. Relentless measures “The trend runs parallel to overall improvement that the country has witnessed. There has been a 63.8% increase in recovered cases in the last 14 days, indicating that the COVID-19 response and management driven by the Centre’s strategy is yielding desired results,” noted the Union Health Ministry. Speaking about the turnaround that the Capital has made, Vice Chancellor of Indraprastha University Mahesh Verma, who heads an expert committee of the Delhi government for COVID management, said: “A number of factors have helped Delhi. With the passage of time, the awareness about the disease has increased. Initially, there were a lot of grey areas. Testing, tracing and treating also improved over time. A lot of guidelines were updated as we gained more knowledge about the disease, which improved the situation. Home isolation and plasma therapy also helped. In Delhi, an advantage was that it was a joint effort of the State and Central governments, railways and others. Everyone brought in their expertise.” Wary of complacency However, Mr. Verma warned that Delhi should not become complacent. “There are reports of a second or third surge in other countries. For instance, Hong Kong is witnessing a third surge. We have to have our guards up,” he said. When asked whether parts of Delhi have attained herd immunity, Mr. Verma said: “The last sero survey showed that about 23% people have developed immunity against the disease and it was in June. When the results of the ongoing survey will be out it will be much clearer whether Delhi has attained herd immunity or we are moving towards it.” The Central government, on its part, had roped in senior experts, including member NITI Aayog V.K. Paul, All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) head Randeep Guleria, and Indian Council of Medical Research head Balaram Bhargava among others to prepare a blueprint for COVID-19 containment when the Capital was witnessing a surge in June. “Testing, tracking and treating were done in an extensive manner with the Capital ensuring that contact-tracing was done within 72 hours of case discovery. The contacts were up to 20-30 persons, which is among the highest in the country. The Central government team also ensured that the city reworked its containment zone planning, and strict measures were implemented not just in the zone perimeter but even within the containment zone,” said a senior Central government official. Repeated survey He added that other key measures included repeated house-to-house survey for people with symptoms, immediate physical isolation of people living in densely-populated areas, enhanced testing within containment zones, ambulance management to ensure zero refusal rate, roping in private car companies to run as ambulances, ensuring that real time data of bed occupancy be made public along with better handling of mortuaries and asking hospitals to strictly comply with the Centre’s treatment protocol. All these helped stabilise the situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhis-virus-slump-is-no-magic-pill-experts/article32281489.ece
06 August 2020||Patna,||Lalu shifted from ward over virus threat||Imprisoned Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad was on Wednesday shifted from the paying ward of the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi, Jharkhand, to the official residence of the hospital director located on the premises due to the fear of COVID-19 infection. Opposition BJP leaders alleged that Mr. Lalu has been getting “preferential treatment” ever since the JMM-Congress-RJD mahagathbandhan government has come to power in Jharkhand. “Mr. Lalu has often been seen using a mobile phone and holding meetings with RJD leaders at the hospital. Now he has been shifted to a bungalow to be protected from COVID-19 infection, while other patients are left at the hospital,” said Jharkhand BJP leader Kumar Sarangi. BJP State spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said, “Now the bungalow will be the headquarters of RJD where Bihar poll strategies will be discussed.” Earlier, after three caretakers of Mr. Lalu tested positive for COVID-19 on July 25, the doctors treating him had submitted a proposal to the hospital authorities to shift him to an isolated area. The hospital authorities decided to shift Mr. Lalu to the official residence of the RIMS director. The residence, known as Kelly’s Bungalow, has been was vacant for some time after the former director, Dr. D.K. Singh, was relieved from his position. The British-era bungalow was considered suitable for security reasons as well. The Ranchi City Superintendent of Police had also made an inspection of the place. “Lalu Prasad was on the first floor at RIMS where the second and third floors are being used to treat COVID-19 patients. Three of his caretakers tested positive, so I had suggested to move him,” Dr. Umesh Prasad said in Ranchi. Dr. Prasad has been looking after the RJD leader’s treatment at RIMS. So far, Jharkhand has registered over 14,000 COVID-19 cases. A photo of Mr. Lalu, talking to someone over phone, and a Jharkhand Minister sitting in hospital corridor had gone viral on social media. Mr. Lalu has been meeting people, including his family members, at his hospital ward every Saturday. He has also been attacking the Bihar government through tweets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/lalu-shifted-from-ward-over-virus-threat/article32281526.ece

Mr. Sisodia said that the DDC will suggest short and long-term measures to improve the revenue base. “The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has put a huge strain on government revenues in the NCT of Delhi and therefore all out efforts need to be made towards revenue augmentation so that the government is able to undertake all necessary works and programmes for the welfare of people of Delhi,” Mr. Sisodia said. The Minister said that the DDC will carry out a detailed study on all contributing factors by analysing all relevant tax-related data of the Delhi government.

The DDC will perform a rigorous study on the improvement of the revenue base of Delhi. We will involve the field experts to perform this study. We are confident that with time and a proper strategy, we will be able to overcome the revenue deficit too.” In a bid to improve Delhi’s revenue deficit situation, the Trade and Taxes Department of Delhi government has also started analysing the return filing status of taxpayers registered under GST.

06 August 2020||NEW DELHI,||Waste on Yamuna bank: NGT warns of penalty||Observing that adequate steps against dumping of unregulated solid waste on the banks of river Yamuna were not being taken by authorities, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has warned of imposing environmental compensation on the Uttar Pradesh government. Taking note of a report furnished by authorities, a Bench headed by NGT chief Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said, “Such action can hardly be held to be enough in the face of serious continued violation of rules for compliance, of which statutory liability is also of higher authorities.” Referring to recommendations put forth by an NGT-appointed oversight committee, the Bench said, “It is clear that steps taken so far are not adequate. The committee has found that arrangement for leachate collection has not been made. Leachate drain was found choked, processing capacity is just enough to cater to day to day processing and is unable to tackle legacy waste.” The green panel specified that recommendations made by the committee had to be followed including bio-remediation and that in case of non-compliance, a fine will be levied on the authorities. The observations came when the Tribunal was hearing a plea, which alleged that illegal disposal of solid waste on the Yamuna floodplains in Vrindavan was affecting the environment adversely.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/waste-on-yamuna-bank-ngt-warns-of-penalty/article32281486.ece
