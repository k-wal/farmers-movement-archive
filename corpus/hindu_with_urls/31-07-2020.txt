31 July 2020||NEW DELH,||‘Team Rahul’ takes on UPA Ministers at Congress meet||A virtual meeting of Rajya Sabha members of the Congress on Thursday, chaired by party president Sonia Gandhi, witnessed a sharp exchange of views between former Ministers in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government and members who are believed to be close to former party chief Rahul Gandhi, highly placed sources said. There has been no formal communication from the party on the closed-door brainstorming session. According to sources who did not wish to be named, when former Law Minister Kapil Sibal questioned the party’s style of functioning, pointed to a lack of coordination and called for “introspection”, newly elected Rajya Sabha member Rajeev Satav countered it by stating that it was the UPA-II government that had “spoilt” the party’s prospects in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and brought its tally to 44. Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram’s observation about the Congress’s inability to generate much public support against the Modi government’s failures because of a “weak organisation” was also countered by the party’s general secretary-organisation, K.C. Venugopal, another close aide of Mr. Gandhi. Former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh was a part of the virtual meeting when Mr. Satav, who previously headed the Youth Congress and is believed to be a part of ‘Team Rahul’, blamed the UPA-II for the Congress’ current problems. Apart from Dr. Singh, several Ministers of the UPA Cabinet, including Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma and Jairam Ramesh, participated in the virtual meeting. Dr. Singh is believed to have been upset at the reference, a senior leader close to him told The Hindu . Members bat for Rahul Given the current state of instability in the party, several members, including Abhishek Singhvi, Digvijaya Singh, Mr. Venugopal and Mr. Satav, strongly endorsed Assam MP Ripun Bora’s suggestion that Mr. Gandhi take over the reins of the party again. The meeting, which went on for nearly four hours, was convened to discuss the current political situation, including the impact of COVID-19, the economic slump, and the stand-off with China. Talking about the challenges of the past few months because of the pandemic, Ms. Gandhi informed her colleagues about her letters to the Prime Minister to help migrant workers through welfare measures, and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and (MGNREGA) the Food Security Act, among others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/team-rahul-takes-on-upa-ministers-at-congress-meet/article32235645.ece

31 July 2020||VIJAYAWADA,||Concession agreement for airport at Dagadarthi cancelled||The State government has terminated the concession agreement entered by the AP Airports Development Corporation Ltd. (APADCL) and the Nellore International Airport Private Ltd. for the development of a greenfield airport at Dagadarthi in Nellore district reportedly owing to to the failure of SCL-Turbo Consortium Pvt. Ltd. to achieve financial closure. The project was awarded to the consortium on Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer basis in September 2017 for developing the airport in 1,352 acres. According to G.O. MS No.5 issued by Special Chief Secretary (industries and commerce) R. Karikal Valaven, the agreement was signed on June 21, 2018, but the developer was yet to complete the financial closure, which should have been done by December 21, 2018. Multiple extensions were granted up to July 15, 2019, which was more than one year from the date of signing of the concession agreement. After the above date, no extension of time was either sought or granted. Besides, the land was not free from encumbrances and the lenders had not come forward to fund the project. The G.O. further says as per the concession agreement, financial closure had to be achieved within the stipulated period and it was an independent obligation cast upon the developer and the same was not connected to handing over of the land by the APADCL, which stated that some portion of the land was made available for the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/concession-agreement-for-airport-at-dagadarthi-cancelled/article32235565.ece
31 July 2020||BHUBANESWAR,||NCW shares story of brave Odisha girl||The story of a tribal girl from Odisha’s Balangir district, whose courage led to the rescue of over 6,000 migrant labourers trapped in brick kilns in Tamil Nadu during the COVID-19 pandemic, was highlighted in a series of tweets by the National Commission for Women on the occasion of the World Day Against Trafficking in Persons, which was celebrated with the theme of ‘First responders to human trafficking’ on Thursday. Mansi Bariha, 19, along with her father and younger sister, had taken an advance of Rs. 28,000 each to work at the GDM brick kiln at Pudhukuppam in Tamil Nadu’s Tiruvallur district. By the time the COVID-19 lockdown was announced, the trio had already worked for several months in return for a paltry food bill of Rs. 250 a week. The workers, hailing mostly from Balangir, Nuapada and Kalahandi, struck a deal with the owner that they could return home if they finished their work in a week’s time, which they did at breakneck speed. The owner, however, backtracked on his promise and did not let the workers go. When they tried to leave the brick kiln in the second week of May, the owner and his men thrashed them mercilessly. Even women and children were not spared. Despite the unprovoked attack, the girl kept recording the incident. She immediately shared photos, audio recordings and videos of the injured workers with WhatsApp contacts, appealing for help urgently. When the videos were shared widely on social media, a voluntary organisation reached out to the Tiruvallur district administration, leading to the expeditious rescue of the workers. According to NGO International Justice Mission, the Tamil Nadu government subsequently arranged about 150 buses and ferried 6,750 labourers, including the 355 labourers from the kiln in which Ms. Bariha was working, to board trains to their homes in Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ncw-shares-story-of-brave-odisha-girl/article32235647.ece

Palaniswami on Thursday announced an extension of the lockdown to curb the COVID-19 spread across the State till August 31. But he also announced fresh relaxations for areas under the Chennai city police and in other parts of the State. Obtaining an e-pass will remain mandatory for inter-district and inter-State travel. In a statement, Mr. Palaniswami said a complete lockdown would be imposed across the State on all Sundays — August 2, 9, 16, 23 and 30. Passengers who have flights on these Sundays can show their air tickets as proof if they are stopped for checking while going to airports, a senior official said. Public bus transport and rail and air traffic shall remain suspended and all public entertainment options shall be out of bounds. Large gatherings of any nature will not be allowed and gyms will remain closed. As for areas under the Chennai city police, Mr. Palaniswami said groceries and provision stores would be allowed to operate between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m., a one-hour extension. Other shops that were allowed to operate earlier between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. would also be allowed to remain open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. “E-commerce companies are allowed to ship both essential and non-essential goods,” the Chief Minister said. Restaurants and tea shops would be allowed to take in customers up to 50% of their seating capacity between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. in non-air-conditioned dining facilities. Restaurants can offer parcel services between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m., as earlier, he said. Small temples (with an annual income less than Rs. 10,000), churches and mosques in village panchayats, town panchayats and municipal limits would be allowed to open for worship with permission from the Collectors. Prominent places of worship and those within the Chennai Corporation limits would not be allowed to open, he said. He announced fresh relaxations in areas under the Chennai city police from August 1. All commercial establishments, private companies and export units that are operating with 50% workforce would be allowed to run with 75% workforce, he said. In other districts, as small temples (with an annual income less than Rs. 10,000), churches and mosques located in village panchayats have already been allowed to open, these places of worship in town panchayats and municipal limits would be allowed to open with permission from the Collectors. They have to follow the Standard Operating Procedure issued earlier. “Prominent places of worship and those within Corporation limits could not be allowed to open for worship,” he said. “E-passes have to be obtained from District Collectors/the Commissioner of Greater Chennai Corporation while moving between districts and into Tamil Nadu, like before,” he said. Though the Centre on Wednesday said e-passes would not be required for inter-State or intra-State travel , Chief Secretary K Shanmugam pointed out that the same points were there even in the guidelines issued by the Union Ministry on Unlock 2 on June 29. He told The Hindu that States “do impose restrictions.” Another official explained that the States are permitted to make the lockdown conditions more severe than what has been allowed by the Centre but not to relax them beyond the Union government’s stipulations. Independence Day would be celebrated on August 15 across the State in compliance with the guidelines issued by the Centre and with strict adherence to precautionary measures, including physical distancing and wearing of masks, the Chief Minister said. Calling for cooperation from people, Mr. Palaniswami said fresh relaxations would be allowed as and when required, based on the conditions. He said the decision to extend the lockdown was based on the inputs from the Collectors, medical and public health experts and senior Ministers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tamil-nadu-govt-extends-lockdown-till-august-31-but-announces-fresh-relaxations/article32235733.ece

31 July 2020||PATNA,||Flood situation remains grim in Bihar||As the flood situation in the State continues to worsen and more and more people from north Bihar seek refuge in government relief camps, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has directed officials to subject inmates to COVID-19 test and give them free masks. At a high-power meeting with State Water Resources Minister and department officials on Wednesday, Mr. Kumar asked officials to ensure social distancing among evacuees at relief camps and in community kitchens. Thousands of people have taken shelter on embankments and national highways. Many have pitched tarpaulin tents, under which they live with their family and their cattle. “We’ve got nothing other than a packet of chura-gur [flattened rice and jaggery] from the government,” one of them told a local TV journalist. The government has been air dropping packets of chura-gur in affected areas. For the flood-affected, COVID-19 norms are among the least of their concerns. “We can’t bother about masks and social distancing when we are struggling for food and livelihood,” said a sexagenarian at Sangrampur, between Piprakothi near Motihari and Gopalganj districts. “Corona has come only now, we’ve been suffering this flood fury for years and the government has done nothing.” Others standing around him, all of them without masks, nod in agreement. The government currently runs 19 relief camps and 989 community kitchens in 11 flood affected districts of the State. In all, 25,116 people have taken shelter at these camps and 5,71,122 have food daily at the community kitchens. “The flood situation in northeastern Bihar continues to be grim, though water level in some rivers has not increased in the last 24 hours…but some new areas have been submerged too,” said a State Disaster Management Department official. “As of now 102 blocks and 901 panchayats in northeast Bihar are affected,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/flood-situation-remains-grim-in-bihar/article32235619.ece
31 July 2020||CHENNAI,||Clarifying LAC could create new disputes, says Chinese envoy||China was not in favour of resuming the process of clarifying the Line of Actual Control (LAC) because it could “create new disputes”, its Ambassador to India Sun Weidong said on Thursday. China’s troops were on the side of its “traditional customary boundary line” on the northern bank of Pangong Lake, where disengagement between the two sides is yet to happen, he stated. That is expected to be taken up later this week at the fifth round of talks between the Corps Commanders of both armies. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said “there has been some progress made” towards complete disengagement along the LAC, “but the disengagement process has as yet not been completed”. “The Senior Commanders of the two sides will meet in the near future to work out steps in this regard,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said. China’s Defence Ministry said on Thursday the situation “tends toward de-escalation and the disengagement between the border troops of the two countries is [being] gradually carried forward.” While the Foreign Ministry said earlier this week border troops “completed disengagement in most localities”, defence sources said it had only been “partial” in some spots, such as Patrolling Point 17A in Gogra-Hot Springs and Pangong Lake. At Pangong Lake, following earlier talks, Chinese troops pulled back from the base of Finger 4, where Beijing’s’s claimed border is, and moved to Finger 5, still well within where India sees the LAC at Finger 8. The ‘fingers’ are mountain spurs on the northern bank of the lake. The Chinese envoy said, “China’s traditional customary boundary line is in accordance with the LAC” on the northern bank of the lake. “There is no such case that China has expanded its territorial claim,” he said, speaking at a webinar organised by the Institute of Chinese Studies (ICS) in New Delhi. “China hopes that [Indian] border troops will strictly abide by the relevant bilateral agreements and protocols, and refrain from illegally crossing the LAC to the Chinese side,” he said. Asked if this summer’s clashes, marking the worst violence on the border since 1967, had reinforced the need to resume the process to clarify the LAC that had been stalled since 2002, Mr. Sun said “if one side unilaterally delimits the LAC as per its own understanding during the negotiations, that could create new disputes and that would be a departure from the original purpose of clarification of the LAC.” “The original purpose of clarification of the LAC is to maintain peace and tranquillity in border areas,” he said. “When we look back into history, we will find that if one side has unilaterally put its own perception of the LAC during the negotiations, that will create new disputes. I think that is why the process cannot move on.” Galwan casualties Asked if China would confirm the number of casualties on its side from the June 15 clash in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed, he said, “What we are now doing is to make joint efforts to de-escalate the situation and ease the tension along border areas.” Ashok Kantha, former Ambassador to China and director of the ICS, said “even experienced Indian diplomats who are deeply invested in this relationship are speaking of the need for a reset in ties”. Mr. Sun said he differed with the view that relations were at a turning point or would be reset.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/clarifying-lac-could-create-new-disputes-says-chinese-envoy/article32235576.ece
31 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||India has key vaccine role: Fauci||Anthony Fauci, top infectious disease specialist and senior adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump on COVID-19, on Thursday said that India would play a critical role in supplying the world with a COVID-19 vaccine. At a web conference organised by the Indian Council for Medical Research, he, however, underlined that though the threat posed by COVID-19 was grave, it was not essential now to conduct human challenge trials to expedite vaccine development. Dr. Fauci, who is the head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said that two potential vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer were in advanced stages of human trials. “India’s manufacturing capabilities is going to be very important. We have made it clear that all tests on vaccines will have to meet regulatory standards and include all ethical review and strong data monitoring and safety boards,” he said at the conference attended by top officials from the ICMR, the Departments of Biotechnology and the Health Ministry. Human trials Human challenge trials involve intentionally infecting healthy vaccinated volunteers with small amounts of the virus. While such trials have been conducted for malaria and dengue, researchers are divided on their ethics. Since COVID-19 is caused by a novel virus and does not have a standard treatment protocol, it is unethical to expose healthy volunteers to that level of risk. “We recently convened an expert consultation on the issue and the conclusion was that such studies are not necessary at this time. The continuing high incidence of the disease is concerning but it makes randomised control trials quite feasible. We don’t have effective therapies to cure individuals infected. These factors have led us to conclude that human challenges are not essential nor ethically justified presently”, he said. The conference also saw discussions on a way to ensure that a vaccine, if and when available, is equitably distributed. Rajesh Bhushan, who will take over as Health Secretary soon, said discussions were under way in the government on the most appropriate way to ensure equitable access to vaccines. “Healthcare workers would be a priority. But there are several other stakeholders, the elderly, those with comorbidities and those extremely marginalised and because of socio-economic conditions are likely to be at particular risk of being severely ill by the infection.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-has-key-vaccine-role-fauci/article32235608.ece
31 July 2020||Srinagar,||Soz scales pillar at home, police warn of action||Senior Congress leader and former Union Minister Saifuddin Soz on Thursday scaled a tall pillar of his gate at Srinagar’s Friends Colony, even as policemen kept warning him against doing so, to make a point that he remained “under house arrest without any formal orders” since August 5 last year. Mr. Soz scaled the pillar of the gate but his interaction was cut short by policemen, who warned of action. “The government lied to the Supreme Court. If I am a free man, then allow me to leave the premises .... I am not a free man. These policemen are saying they have orders from the top,” Mr. Soz shouted from behind the gate. Despite the criticism raised by several political parties over his “house arrest”, Mr. Soz was not released till late Thursday evening. “There has been no communication from any official or any relaxation on my restrictions so far”, he told The Hindu.  He also asserted that he was never allowed to venture out without the permission of the police. He said, “I did meet my ailing sister twice and visited Delhi for medical check-ups twice since August 5, 2019, but only after seeking formal permission from the police ... On many occasions, I was denied permission. I remain under house arrest without any formal orders”. The J&K administration on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that Mr. Soz was “not under detention”, following which the top court closed the petition by his wife asking for his release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/soz-scales-pillar-at-home-police-warn-of-action/article32235594.ece
31 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC looks to save both animals and crops||An “anxious” Supreme Court accentuated the urgent need to find an alternative to killing marauding wild animals as vermin even while protecting crops from them. Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, heading a three-judge Bench, suggested “explosives that do not kill” but make a lot of noise and “rubber bullets” to scare off the animals. The court was hearing a petition filed by Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MP Anubhav Mohanty seeking measures to prevent killing of wild animals in India. Mr. Mohanty highlighted the indiscriminate killing of blue bulls (nilgai) as vermin. Elephant’s death Issuing a notice, the court tagged the petition with an earlier one on an elephant who died after consuming pineapples laced with explosives in Kerala. Chief Justice Bobde said man-animal conflict is leading to both killing of wildlife and crop loss. “We are treating this matter with anxiety. Wild animals are destroying agriculture. We have to preserve our crops... What do you eat if animals eat it all? At the same time, can we kill a wild tiger or a rogue elephant... What are the Forest Department officials to do about this? What is the extent of information they have?” Chief Justice Bobde asked senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, who appeared for Mr. Mohanty. Chief Justice Bobde asked Mr. Luthra to study the problem and suggest measures so that the court could pass the necessary orders. Human encroachments The court asked Mr. Luthra to also enquire into whether human encroachments into forests are driving wild animals away from their natural habitats, forcing them to foray into human settlements for food. “Encroachments by human is putting pressure on wild animals,” Mr. Luthra submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-looks-to-save-both-animals-and-crops/article32235598.ece
31 July 2020||Bhopal,||Bhopal gas leak widows await pension||Gyarsibai Prajapati is thankful to her house owner for waiving the rent for four months, albeit not due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For eight months, the 90-year-old woman, whose husband died in the 1984 Bhopal gas leak, has been awaiting in vain for the monthly pension of a meagre Rs. 1,000. “That amount is invaluable for me,” says Ms. Prajapati as she leans on a cane outside a fair price shop on Thursday afternoon. The point of sale machine does not recognise her nearly flat thumb, precluding her from getting ration for three days. “I used to pay my rent of Rs. 400 using the pension, and bought vegetables and lentils from the market. But now, only the ration shop can feed me,” says Ms. Prajapati, who resides on the first floor of an apartment in the Jeevan Jyoti colony here, an enclave for the widows. Her son and his family live on the third floor. Like Ms. Prajapati, as many as 4,998 other women, whose husbands died in the methyl isocyanate leak from a pesticide plant, have been awaiting widows’ pension since December 2019. The pension, initiated in 2011, was stopped from April 2016 to November 2017, but was started again after being prompted by activists. The widows need the pension during the pandemic more than ever, said Balkrishna Namdeo of Gas Peedit Nirashrit Pension Bhogi Sangharsh Morcha. “The government is going back on its stand,” he said. The 2011-2012 annual report of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy Relief and Rehabilitation Department said the pension would be ‘lifelong’.”   “There are no funds left,” the Department’s director, Basant Kurre, told The Hindu . The pension scheme, he said, was only meant for five years and the Centre had allocated Rs. 30 crore for it. Using the interest on that amount, it was extended for another two years. “Now it’s a policy decision. We have referred the matter to the government,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bhopal-gas-leak-widows-await-pension/article32235631.ece
31 July 2020||BHUBANESWAR,||People eating less to cope with crisis in Odisha districts||Cash benefits dished out by the government were not sufficient for marginalised people to cope with the crisis induced by the COVID-19 pandemic in the migration-prone districts of Odisha, said the State unit of the Right to Food Campaign (RTFC). The RTFC, a forum of civil rights activists involved in highlighting right to food issues, conducted a telephonic survey of social pension beneficiaries — the elderly, disabled, widows and single women — in four migration-prone districts of Bargarh, Balangir, Kalahandi and Nuapada between July 1 and 15. They were able to reach 63 respondents. “More than half (54%) of the sample families had resorted to eating less to cope with food insecurity and are worried they may ran out of food stock soon. Nearly a third of the families (69%) had to borrow or take a small loan from relatives or neighbours to buy food items during the lockdown. The worst situation is that 13% of the sample families had to go hungry for one or more days due to the non-availability of food at home,” said Sameet Panda of RTFC. “The pandemic has not only turned out to be a health and economic crisis, it is slowly becoming food and nutrition crisis as well. In such a situation, where there is a restriction of movement due to lockdowns, the food security condition of already vulnerable populations such as the aged, disabled and single women tends to go worse,” he pointed out. “When it came to food insecurity among the sample families, 16% of them had already exhausted the PDS (public distribution system) rice, and for another one fourth sample families, the rice at home would last only 2 to 7 days. And two-thirds of the families were left with no money to buy rice or food items,” said Mr. Panda. The RTFC recommended that PDS coverage be made universal in the State at least till the pandemic passed. Advance ration must be released for the next three months, which should include basic items like pulses, salt and oil, the campaigners said. The RTFC also urged the advance payment of social security pension for six months to all pension beneficiaries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/people-eating-less-to-cope-with-crisis-in-odisha-districts/article32235622.ece
31 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||BJP accounts for 54% of U.P. Lok Sabha poll expenses||The BJP accounted for more than half of the expenditure incurred by 10 political parties in Uttar Pradesh in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, according to a report released on Thursday by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR). The report analysed the expenditure statements submitted to the Election Commission of India (ECI) by five national parties – the BJP, the Congress, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Communist Party of India (CPI) and five regional parties – the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the All-India Forward Bloc (AIFB), the Janata Dal (United) (JD-U), the Shiv Sena (SHS) and the Samajwadi Party (SP). The national parties spent a total of Rs. 1,309.846 crore and the SP, the SHS and the AAP Rs. 96.68 crore, while the JD(U) and the AIFB declared that they did not incur any expenditure though they did contest the polls, the ADR report said. Cong. spent Rs. 489.97 cr. The highest expenditure was incurred by the BJP, which spent Rs. 763.31 crore or 54.27% of the total spending by the parties analysed. The Congress spent Rs. 489.97 crore, or 34.83%, followed by the BSP, which spent Rs. 55.39 crore, or 3.94%. “More than 99% of the political parties’ total expenditure was spent from the central headquarters of the political parties. In the case of the BSP, the SP, the AAP and the NCP, no expenditure was incurred by parties from their State units,” the report said. Publicity expenditure The parties analysed in the report declared that they spent the most on publicity (Rs. 813.13 crore), followed by travel expenses (Rs. 341.68 crore), other/miscellaneous expenses (Rs. 241.95 crore) and lumpsum payments to candidates (Rs. 64.08 crore). The Congress spent the most on publicity (Rs. 402.91 crore), followed by the BJP (Rs. 376.62 crore). Meanwhile, the national parties declared they collected a total of Rs. 4,529.56 crore and the regional parties, except the AIFB which declared zero funds received, declared Rs. 153.56 crore. “The BJP collected the highest funds during the parliamentary elections 2019 of Rs 3,682.06 crore, or 78.62%, followed by the Congress, which collected Rs. 843.92 crore, or 18.02%, and the SHS, which collected 2.15%, or Rs. 100.595 crore, of the total funds collected by the 10 parties analysed. More than 98% of the political parties’ total funds were collected from the central headquarters. In the case of the SP, the NCP, the BSP and the JD(U), no funds were collected from parties’ State units,” the report said.  Delay flagged Flagging the delays in submitting the expenditure statements, the ADR report recommended that the parties should be penalised for not submitting the documents on time. The expenditure statements, which are supposed to be submitted to the ECI within 90 days of completion of the Lok Sabha poll, was submitted after a delay of 85 days by the BJP and 66 days by the Congress, the report noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-accounts-for-54-of-up-lok-sabha-poll-expenses/article32235625.ece
31 July 2020||Srinagar,||J&K administration set to highlight its achievements||From August 5, Jammu and Kashmir will start a series of programmes on the first anniversary of removal of special status to highlight the achievements made by the Union Territory (UT) administration in the past 12 months. The Chief Secretary has asked all administrative secretaries in Srinagar to be present from August 8 to 11. “An important event is likely to be organised in Srinagar on August 10. The event is being coordinated by the Principal Secretary, Information, and the Secretary, Rural Development and Panchayati Raj,” an official said. The UT administration is planning a media blitzkrieg to highlight the achievements. Four IAS officers have been assigned to “facilitate and educate” reporters from outside the UT about the achievements made in the past 12 months. An official said the spending under the Rs. 80,000-lakh Prime Minister Development Package, the market intervention scheme to buy apples directly from farmers, issuance of domicile certificates among different communities, election of chairpersons for the block development councils will top the highlights. The new employment rules to bring in transparency, more focus on the written tests rather than interviews, and more powers to grassroot representatives and extending insurance schemes are likely to be highlighted during these functions.  The J&K administration also mentioned the drive to fill 10,000 posts and reservation to Paharis, International Border residents. The abolition of the Lakhanpur as part of the one nation one tax, unbundling of power department and structural reforms carried out in Industries, Tourism, Finance and Police departments are other focus areas of the UT administration. “J&K becomes 100% (ODF) Open defecation free,” it claimed. The administration also highlighted as an achievement the unique public outreach, with 36 Union Ministers visiting J&K in one week. Lt. Governor briefed Meanwhile, General Officer Commanding (GoC) 15 Corps, Lieutenant General B.S. Raju, called on Lieutenant Governor Girish Chandra Murmu at the Raj Bhavan in Srinagar, days ahead of the anniversary. An official said the Army officer briefed the Lt. Governor about the recent internal security developments and the prevailing security scenario in the Union Territory. The Lt. Governor advised heightened surveillance and stressed on keeping a close watch on all vital installations to ensure the safety and security of the people, the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jk-administration-set-to-highlight-its-achievements/article32235629.ece
31 July 2020||New Delhi,||Govt. lied to Supreme Court that Soz is free, says Congress||Congress leaders on Thursday slammed the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) administration for “lying” to the Supreme Court about Congress leader Saifuddin Soz not being under detention. Senior Advocate and Rajya Sabha member Abhishek Singhvi, who represented Mr. Soz, said if reports of restrictions are “factually” established then the J&K administration is liable for “perjury and contempt of court”. Mr. Soz’s son, Salman, addressed the Supreme Court through Twitter and asked if the top court will hold the J&K administration accountable for lying or will it accept its own “humiliation”. Tagging a video clip, Mr. Salman Soz tweeted, “Dear Supreme Court of India: The J&K Government lied to you. This is proof. Now, will you accept your own humiliation or hold the govt accountable? History will judge you.” Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “The illegal detention of political leaders with absolutely no basis damages the fabric of our nation. Mr Soz must be released at once”. On Wednesday, responding to a habeas corpus petition filed by Mr. Soz’s wife, the J&K administration filed an affidavit to claim that the Congress leader was never placed under any restraint and was always free to move.  Plea disposed of The Bench of Justices Arun Mishra, Vineet Saran, and M.R. Shah then disposed of the plea in which Mr. Singhvi, along with advocate Sunil Fernandes, had represented the Congress leader’s wife. However, a news report hours later showed a video clip where Mr. Soz was heard telling TV crew in Srinagar that he was not allowed to come out of his house and it was like being in a “Police State”. He also asked the TV crew to show the clip to the Supreme Court. “Depending on facts, depending on nature of limitations and restrictions on Mr. Soz, he will decide his further course of action,” Dr. Singhvi told The Hindu . “If factually limitations and restrictions [are] established, it would be both perjury on affidavit and contempt of court.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-lied-to-supreme-court-that-soz-is-free-says-congress/article32235828.ece
31 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Tougher lockdown curbs spurred domestic violence’||Domestic violence and online sexual abuse cases were higher in red-zone COVID-19 districts as compared to those in orange and green zones, according to a new study which argues that gender-based violence shifted from streets to domestic spaces due to restrictions on mobility. The Working Paper titled, “Unintended Consequences of Lockdowns: COVID-19 and the Shadow Pandemic” was published in the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) on July 20, and is authored by Manisha Shah and Saravana Ravindran from the University of California at Los Angeles. The study highlights that domestic violence complaints rose by 131% and those on online abuse increased by 184% in red zone districts as compared to green zones districts. Correspondingly, there was a significant decrease in harassment, rape, and sexual assault complaints in red and orange zone districts relative to green zone districts in the months during and after the lockdown. The paper “compares districts over time, while also comparing across districts,” Ms. Shah told The Hindu in an email. Effective May 1, all districts in the country were demarcated as red, orange and green on the basis of cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. Districts with the highest number of cases were identified as red zones and saw strictest curbs on public movement, while those with no positive cases in the past 21 days were identified as green zones and saw least restrictions. An orange zone was one where new cases were emerging but at a decreasing rate. The authors compare the complaints received by the National Commission for Women between October 2019 and May 2020 with district-wise data on lockdown categories issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs. They also studied the affect of lockdown measures on mobility of individuals using data from Google Community Mobility Reports, which show percentage change in the number of visitors to places of interest in a particular week relative to the five-week period from January 3–February 6, 2020. Working on the premise that domestic violence is not just a consequence of restricted mobility, but of patriarchal mindsets. the study uses data from National Family Healthy Survey 4 (2015-2016) and finds that districts “in which a greater proportion of husbands report that beating wives is justified see greater increases in domestic violence complaints received by the NCW in May 2020 in red zone districts relative to green zone districts. On the other hand, districts in which a greater proportion of wives report that a husband beating his wife is justified see fewer domestic violence complaints received by the NCW in May 2020 in red zone districts relative to green zone districts.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tougher-lockdown-curbs-spurred-domestic-violence/article32235627.ece
31 July 2020||Kozhikode,||Kerala’s action plan against COVID-19||Religious leaders, opinion makers, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are to be roped in for implementing the State government’s Covid Health Action Plan for coastal areas that is expected to strengthen the COVID-19 prevention work there and ensure primary health-care facilities to the residents. They will be part of the district coastal health boards to be chaired by the respective District Collectors. Local-level coastal health task forces too will be formed. The action plan also proposes setting up of special outposts, testing facilities, first-line treatment centres, and institutions for reverse quarantine to help elderly people and those with serious health issues. An order released by the department on Thursday says the decision to have a special plan for the coastal areas was taken in view of a large number of cases emerging in clusters in coastal areas. Sentinel surveillance is being undertaken there to get information of possible cases there. The first case of community spread in the country was reported in the coastal belt of Thiruvananthapuram. The religious leaders, opinion leaders, and NGO representatives will be separately sensitised about COVID-19 prevention, surveillance, and protocols. Elected representatives in local bodies, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), community volunteers, and health staff will visit each house to create awareness.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/keralas-action-plan-against-covid-19/article32235553.ece
31 July 2020||CHENNAI,||In the red, Railways puts on hold all non-safety work||The Ministry of Railways has suspended all new/umbrella works included in the ‘Pink Book’ in 2020-21 in view of the unprecedented fall in revenue caused by the COVID-19 pandemic that brought passenger train operations to a grinding halt. Modernisation, upgradation of passenger amenities, station development and other non-safety work to the tune of a few thousand crores have been placed in abeyance, sources in the Railways said. In a note to the General Managers of Zonal Railways, Production Units and other major establishments, the Railway Board said works which impact the safe running of trains and considered “essential and inescapable” may be considered for execution. Moreover, the essentiality of such works would be examined by top officials of the Board for clearance. Works that were approved last year (2019-20) but made insignificant physical progress would also be frozen until further orders, except those which were essentially required for the safe operation of trains. The Railways received a budgetary allocation of Rs. 70,000 crore this year and an outlay for capital expenditure amounting to Rs. 1.61 lakh crore. Of this, Rs. 20,000 crore is earmarked for funding critical safety-related works under the Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK), the sources said. On how the suspension of work would impact the Railways, a senior official said, a variety of works relating to the enhancement of passenger amenities, modernisation of yards/workshops/production units, all non-safety construction work, etc., would be put on hold now.“This is an unprecedented blanket ban on non-safety works caused by the serious financial crisis. Passenger earnings have hit an all time low,” the official said. Though there is no specific instruction on suspending major projects like electrification and broad gauge conversion/doubling projects, a circular from the Financial Commissioner (Railways), pointing to the 58% drop in traffic earnings till the end of May, and imposing spending limits on Ordinary Working Expenses, Depreciation Reserve Fund, Development Fund and the Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh, only points to severe reduction on spending and more focus on earning, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-the-red-railways-puts-on-hold-all-non-safety-work/article32235564.ece
31 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||CBI takes over probe into death of violinist Balabhaskar||The Central Bureau of Investigation has taken over the case of suspicious death of famous violinist Balabhaskar and his 18-month-old daughter in a car accident at Pallipuram in Kerala in September 2018. In a petition to the Kerala Chief Minister last year, the violinist's parents alleged that the suspects in the case were linked to gold smuggling and that there were suspicious financial transactions in his bank account after his death. Subsequently, in December 2019, the State government referred the case to the CBI for further probe. The accident took place, when Balabhaskar, his wife Lakshmi and their daughter Tejaswini Bala were on their way back from Thrissur. Their car hit a roadside tree due to “rash” driving by accused Arjun K. Narayanan. Tejaswini succumbed to the injuries, while the others were rushed to hospital. The violinist died on October 2, 2018. Neither the local police nor the Crime Branch filed any final report in the case, according to the FIR. Meanwhile, the CBI told its Special Court in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday that the parents of the musician were sceptical about the conclusion of the Kerala police that Balabhaskar and Tejaswini had died in a typical road accident. The police had also ruled out the question of foul play.   (With inputs from G.

31 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||Priyanka hands over bungalow to CPWD||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday handed over the possession of the bungalow she was living in to the government, the party said. On July 1, the allotment was cancelled and she was given a month to vacate. In a statement, the communications wing of the All India Congress Committee said Ms. Vadra handed over 35 Lodhi Estate to the Central Public Works Department (CPWD). The house keys were accepted by engineers concerned on behalf of the CPWD “after a full inspection establishing that the house was handed over in good condition”. A “vacation report” was issued by the CPWD, it stated. “She will be residing in temporary accommodation until a more permanent accommodation in Delhi rented by her is ready for use,” the Congress statement said. Ms. Vadra was allotted government accommodation in 1997 due to security concerns as she was given Special Protection Group (SPG) cover. The DoE, under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, on July 1 cancelled the allotment, citing the revocation of her SPG cover. In November 2019, her SPG protection was downgraded to Z+ category.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/priyanka-hands-over-bungalow-to-cpwd/article32235604.ece
31 July 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||CBI to probe Balabhaskar’s death||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has opened a criminal inquiry into the death of violinist Balabhaskar in a ‘suspicious’ car accident here in September 2018. The agency told its Special Court here on Wednesday that the parents of the musician were deeply sceptical about the conclusion of the Kerala Police that Balabhaskar and his two-year-old daughter Tejaswani Bala died in a typical road accident. Balabhaskar’s wife Lakshmi and car driver Arjun Radhakrishnan had sustained severe injuries in the incident and were hospitalised for long. The police had said in a court filing in November 2019 that the accident occurred when Arjun, who was at the wheel, dozed off. The car veered hard to the extreme right of the carriageway and dashed against a tree abutting the road. The family was returning home from Thrissur. However, Arjun’s subsequent insistence that Balabhaskar was at the wheel at the time of the accident had added an element of murkiness to the incident. Eyewitness statements by passers-by were contradictory and often misleading. Moreover, the musician’s immense popularity as a youth icon had spawned countless conspiracy theories. Parents’ plea The parents of Balabhaskar petitioned Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for a CBI inquiry in 2019. They pointed out that the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) had booked two of the musician’s aides, both part of Balabhaskar’s entourage when he travelled abroad for stage programmes, on the charge of having smuggled gold in bulk through the international airport here in 2018. The CBI said the parents of the musician wanted it to investigate whether Arjun had any link with gold smuggling. They also wanted the agency to scrutinise Balabhaskar’s financial dealings and examine fellow investors to find out whether anybody inimical to Balabhaskar had orchestrated the car accident. Officials said the CBI was poised to reconstruct the accident. It would also re-examine the fingerprints and serological evidence lifted from the scene of the collision. The accident had occurred in the early hours of September 25, 2018.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbi-to-probe-balabhaskars-death/article32235992.ece
31 July 2020||Bengaluru,||Karnataka holds CET, results in 15 to 20 days||Results of the ongoing Common Entrance Test (CET) will be announced in 15 to 20 days. Speaking to presspersons on Thursday, Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Higher Education C.N. Ashwath Narayan said the examination for two papers — biology and mathematics — were conducted smoothly across 497 centres in the State. Of the 1,94,419 registered students for CET this year, around 1,47,491 (75.89%) attempted the biology paper and around 1,73,408 (89.22%) the mathematics paper. Last year, out of the 1,94, 311 registered students, around 1,48,022 (79.90%) wrote the biology paper and 1,78,517 (91.92%) the mathematics paper. “COVID-19 might not be the reason for the dip in the number of students. Biology is optional and hence fewer students attempted it. Also, last year, the results of II PU exam were not announced at the time CET was conducted. This year, both State board and ICSE results are out. Hence, there is a dip this year,” he said. Students will write the physics and chemistry papers on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-holds-cet-results-in-15-to-20-days/article32235555.ece
31 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||Australia urges India, China to show restraint||Australia on Thursday urged India and China to maintain restraint along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and expressed support to the ongoing de-escalation efforts. It said it opposed any attempts to unilaterally alter thestatus quo, which only served to increase tension and the risk of instability. “It is important that the bilaterally-agreed principles and norms that have helped prevent escalation or miscalculation in the border areas over many decades continue to be observed,” Australia’s High Commissioner to India, Barry O’Farrell, said in a statement. Mr. O’Farrell pointed out that the Indo-Pacific region was grappling with the enormous challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and reiterated the Australian vision for an open, free, rules-based Indo-Pacific. “Territorial disputes and competing claims should be resolved peacefully by the claimant countries, and in ways consistent with international law,” he observed. Mr. O’Farrell, without naming any country, said Australia remained deeply concerned by actions in the South China Sea (SCS) that were “destabilising and could provoke escalation.” On July 23, Australia lodged a note with the United Nations Secretary General, refuting China’s unlawful maritime claims in the SCS.    On Tuesday, in a joint statement, Australia and the United States expressed “deep concern” over recent developments in Hong Kong, “repression of Uyghurs” in Xinjiang and China’s maritime claims in the SCS. The Chinese Embassy reacted sharply, warning that Australia should not “go further on the road of harming [bilateral] relations” and that “any attempt to pressure China will never succeed.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/australia-urges-india-china-to-show-restraint/article32235581.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||NEP still not available in public domain||Even after a day Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank announced on Wednesday that the new National Education Policy (NEP) had been approved by the Union Cabinet, the policy document is yet to be made available in the public domain. “We are still waiting for written approval for the policy to come from the Cabinet Secretariat. After that, we will upload it on the Ministry website”, said a senior official in the Minister's office, when asked about the delay on Thursday evening. Exact phrasing Although its highlights were announced at a press conference after the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, academics and State governments are awaiting the actual document, as the exact phrasing used has previously resulted in significant changes in policies. When the original NEP draft was released by the Centre in May 2019, it contained a clause stipulating the teaching of Hindi as part of the three-language formula in schools. Following a backlash from Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and other States, the Centre issued a revised phrasing of that clause. The question of whether primary education in the medium of the mother tongue or regional language will be mandatory for States may now be dependent on the exact phrasing in the final document. Students and teachers are also awaiting the document to understand the implementation timelines of the decisions. On Twitter, current M.Phil students are asking what will be the impact on them, now that the programme has been scrapped.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nep-still-not-available-in-public-domain/article32235589.ece
31 July 2020||New Delhi,||Parliamentary panel to discuss draft EIA||After a flurry of letters between Congress leader Jairam Ramesh and Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on the implications of the Draft Environment Impact Assessment 2020 (EIA 2020), the Parliamentary Committee of Science and Technology headed by Mr. Ramesh will deliberate on the subject at its meeting scheduled for August 7. The meeting comes three days ahead of the deadline for submission of public comments and objections to the Draft EIA 2020, which ends on August 11. Representatives of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change have been called to explain the draft. DMK Rajya Sabha member R.S. Bharathi, a member of the committee, had also urged Mr. Ramesh to convene a meeting at the earliest to deliberate on the subject after his party president M.K. Stalin demanded that the government revisit the draft. Mr. Ramesh wrote his first letter to Mr. Javadekar on July 25 saying that the proposed changes in the EIA display a mindset that “environmental regulations are unnecessary regulatory burden.” ‘Unfounded points’ In response, Mr. Javadekar on Sunday said the points made by Mr. Ramesh were “unfounded and based on misinterpretation”. He said government decisions were always open to “scrutiny by Parliament and standing committees”. Mr. Ramesh shot back a four-page letter to Mr. Javadekar on Monday detailing his five main objections to the draft that he had sent in his July 25 letter. He says the draft allowed post-facto approvals which go against the very principle of assessment and public participation prior to environmental clearance, and has provisions that will routinely legitimise illegality. Second, the notification reduces public participation in all steps of the environment clearance process, lessening the notice period for public hearing and doing away with them for a large category of projects. Third, it does away with the environmental impact assessment altogether in many cases of expansion. Fourth, it increases the validity of environment clearances allowing projects to “secure” land for long durations even when they are not constructed. And finally it gives the Union government full powers to appoint State environmental impact assessment authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/parliamentary-panel-to-discuss-draft-eia/article32235617.ece
31 July 2020||HYDERABAD,||AP told to stop any process on RLIP||Ahead of the Apex Council meeting, scheduled to be held on August 5, to discuss the disputes over river water disputes between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) has once again asked the AP State government to stop Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Project (RLIP) and not to proceed with the process of tenders. In a letter addressed to the Special Chief Secretary of the Water Resources Department of AP, Member of the KRMB Harikesh Meena, has drawn the attention of the AP government to its two letters addressed earlier in the same matter in the third week of May and first week of July and asked it to stop any work/process on RLIP. The river board’s fresh letter to AP comes in the wake of Telangana complaint to it for the third time on the project proposed by AP. The river board has reiterated in its latest communication that giving administrative approval and proceeding with the tenders process in case of RLIP was in violation of the Section 84 and Para-7 of the XI Schedule of the AP Reorganisation Act. Further, the KRMB official has also pointed out in his letter to AP government that it (AP) has not submitted the detailed project report (DPR) of the proposed project to the board as well as the Central Water Commission (CWC) for appraisal. Accordingly, the river board has directed AP on two earlier occasions too not to go ahead with projects proposed by it till they are appraised by KRMB and CWC as also the approval of the Apex Council is obtained. Telangana government, in its letter to the river board on July 25, has brought to the notice of KRMB that AP was going ahead with the tender process for RLIP without complying with its (KRMB’s) instructions and getting the project proposal appraised by KRMB and CWC. Meanwhile, the Telangana government has found fault with the AP government for proceeding with RLIP in spite of instructions against taking up any work related to the project proposal, including the process of tenders. Recently, the AP government had called for tenders for works worth Rs. 3,278.18 crore for execution of RLIP in the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) method in 30 months. According to the notification issued by the AP government, the last date for filing of tenders is August 10 and the technical and commercial bids are scheduled to be opened on August 12 and 13.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ap-told-to-stop-any-process-on-rlip/article32235958.ece
31 July 2020||Thrissur,||Thrissur Archdiocese plans crematorium||The Thrissur Archdiocese of the Syro-Malabar Church is planning to set up a crematorium since many churches are finding it difficult to bury the bodies of COVID-19 patients by adhering to the government protocol. Many church cemeteries do not have the facility to bury the bodies in the depth mandated by the regulations. In some cases, parishioners had objected to burial of the body in the church cemetery. Application Fr. Joy Mookkan, on behalf of the archdiocese, has submitted an application to the district administration for licence to set up a crematorium. District Collector S. Shanavas has asked the officials concerned to take immediate steps on the application. The archdiocese is planning to set up the crematorium on a one-acre plot at Mulayam in the name of the Damian Institute under the archdiocese. The rituals will be held as per Christian religious practice. “The archdiocese has been thinking of setting up a crematorium for long. Churches in the coastal belt too face problems with burial of bodies,”said Fr. Nysson Alanthanath, its spokesperson. “So, the facility will be useful even after the pandemic time. Though cremation of bodies is new to Christians here, it is common in other States,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/thrissur-archdiocese-plans-crematorium/article32235990.ece
31 July 2020||HYDERABAD,||TS wants Apex Council meeting after August 20||An official meeting chaired by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, on Thursday decided to write to MInistry of Jalshakti seeking postponement of the proposed Apex Council meeting on river water disputes between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to a date after August 20 as August 5 suggested by the Ministry was not convenient. The Apex Council meeting was proposed to be organised virtually between the Chief Ministers of both States and the Union Minister of Jalshakti. A release said the meeting was of view that the State government was preoccupied with its programmes on August 5 and, also, the date was not convenient in view of Independence Day 10 days later. Mr. Rao and several other officials, including the Supreme Court advocate of Telangana Ravinder Rao, discussed the letter written by the Ministry’s secretary U.P. Singh seeking the State government’s consent for the August 5 meeting and the strategy to be adopted in the proceedings. A release said it was decided to wage struggles to any extent to secure the State’s share in the water of Krishna and Godavari without compromise. The meeting felt the Ministry displayed utter failure in resolving water dispute between the two States. It abdicated its traditional responsibility of ensuring that the allocation of water to the new States was done smoothly. When there were no disputes between States, the allocation should be done by the Centre. But, the matter should be referred to water disputes tribunal when there were disputes. Since there were pre-existing disputes between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, the former State had always insisted that the resolution be left to tribunal as per Section 13 of AP Reorganisation Act. But, the Centre paid a deaf ear to the voice of Telangana, the meeting felt and condemned the latest initiative.  ‘Heavy price’ The Centre adopted a lackadaisical approach, the State government said and urged it to give it up at least now. Both States will have to pay a heavy price on account of the irresponsible approach of Centre, the release added. Legal solution to court cases and arguments in tribunals was the only way forward in the interest of both States. The meeting decided to proceed unmindful of obstacles in completion of Palamuru–Rangareddy and Dindi lift-irrigation projects by giving them top priority. It was also decided to speed up project works to make optimal use of Telangana’s share in water of Godavari and Krishna. An uncompromising stand should be taken. The meeting was attended by Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, Principal Irrigation Secretary Rajat Kumar and others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/state-wants-apex-council-meeting-after-august-20/article32235964.ece

Governor Kalraj Mishra has summoned the Assembly after approving the State Cabinet's fourth proposal. The political situation and the strategies for keeping the MLAs united were discussed at a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting at the hotel on Thursday. Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi told reporters after the meeting that all legislators would “remain united” and stay together till the session. Mr. Joshi did not clarify if the MLAs would continue to camp at the same hotel. “It will be decided [later] where to stay,” he said, while affirming that no location outside the State would be selected. The Ministers would go to the Secretariat to take care of work in their respective departments, he added. While the MLAs loyal to Mr. Gehlot will be celebrating the upcoming festivals of Id-ul-Zuha, Raksha Bandhan and Krishna Janmashtami away from their families, the 19 dissident MLAs in the rival Sachin Pilot camp are said to be camping at two hotels near Gurugram in Haryana. The impasse between the Congress government and the Governor ended late on Wednesday night, when the latter accepted the Cabinet's advice for convening the Assembly session after rejecting three earlier proposals. The Governor had insisted upon calling the session on a 21-day notice, unless some “concrete reasons” were given for an urgent sitting. Hints at horse-trading Mr. Gehlot, who chaired the CLP meeting, said in a veiled dig at the Governor and the BJP that the “rate of horse-trading” had increased after the date for commencement of the session was announced.“Earlier, the first instalment was of Rs. 10 crore and the second Rs. 15 crore. It has now become unlimited and everyone knows who is involved in these affairs,” he said.Mr. Gehlot hinted that a confidence vote would be sought during the session, but said the agenda for the House would be decided by the Business Advisory Committee. He also said he wanted the dissident MLAs to attend the session, as they had been elected on the Congress symbol.  Meanwhile, the Rajasthan High Court on Thursday issued notices to the Assembly Speaker and six BSP MLAs on the writ petitions moved by BJP MLA Madan Dilawar and the BSP challenging their merger with Congress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-mlas-to-stay-together-till-session/article32235570.ece

The remarks from the official spokesperson Anurag Srivastava come days after Bangladesh Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen urged India to avoid actions that could create cracks in the relationship especially in view of the upcoming construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. “We are confident that both sides appreciate mutual sensitivity and mutual respect in building further on this relationship,” said Mr. Srivastava during the weekly briefing of the MEA when asked to respond to Mr. Momen’s comments.  The Hindu had reported Mr. Momen’s comments where he said “both the government and the society” of India have the responsibility of sustaining good relationship with Bangladesh. “India and Bangladesh share a historic and arterial relationship. We will not allow this (temple construction) to hurt ties but I would still urge that India should not allow any development that can fracture our beautiful and deep relationship,” Mr Momen had said speaking exclusively to The Hindu . External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, speaking during a ceremony to hand over of 10 locomotives to Bangldesh Railways on Monday, had described Bangladesh as a “role model” of good neighbourly relation in South Asia.

Senior leader Anand Sharma alleged that the government was deliberately avoiding a Parliamentary session in order to avoid accountability on the current challenges. Mr. Chidambaram is learnt to have pointed out that the Modi government has been able to “manage public perception despite failing to effectively deal with China, corona[virus] or the economy because of the weak organisational structure of the Congress”. Mr. Venugopal then went on to give details of a number of digital campaigns on social media, and meetings with PCC chiefs and Lok Sabha Members of Parliament to assert that “the party organisation was not weak and was doing its best”. Bihar leader Akhilesh Pratap Singh then hit back by saying that this, “may be the case in Kerala but certainly not in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh”. Ahead of the August 5 Bhoomi Puja for the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, Haryana MP Deepender Hooda reminded his colleagues that the CWC had welcomed the Supreme Court judgment and, therefore, there should not be any contradictory voice from the party as the sentiments of the people were involved. Senior Congress Leader Ahmed Patel spoke about the need to carefully go through the National Education Policy. Punjab MP, Shamsher Singh Dullo, spoke against the culture of “para-dropping” leaders at the All India Congress Committee “at the cost of the party workers instead of them working their way up through the frontal organisations”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/team-rahul-takes-on-upa-ministers-at-cong-meet/article32235571.ece

31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||Worship with love||In his Kandar Alankaram, (verse 51), Arunagirinatha says that one should give food to the hungry, for this act will be of great help to the giver when his soul leaves the body. The journey to the other world is long, and if one has provided food to the needy, then this act of kindness will help during this journey, said R. Narayanan in a discourse. Thiruvalluvar says the ideal way to save one’s wealth, in such a way that it will serve one’s needs later in life, is to provide food to the hungry. Arunagirinatha says that if someone who is hungry turns up, then give him something to eat — greens and something that has been cooked well. In the same verse, Arunagirinatha talks about penance. Thirukkural says penance without love in one’s heart is of no use. Yet another verse in Thirukkural gives a unique meaning for the word penance — bearing one’s problems without complaining and not causing harm to others is penance. Thiruvalluvar also says that only that which is given to the needy can be considered an act of charity. What is given to others is given with a view to obtaining a quid pro quo later. Worship of God involves worshipping with love. It also involves treating others with respect and love. Thiruvalluvar says that those with love will not think of anything as belonging exclusively to them, but will share their wealth with others. But those with no love will lay claim to everything as theirs. Thiruvalluvar says that a worm is unable to withstand the heat of the sun. Likewise, those with no love will be scorched by dharma, and will be unable to withstand this heat. Only those with love can be said to be alive. In the case of one who lacks love, all he has is a skeleton covered with skin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/worship-with-love/article32235596.ece

Amid acute shortage of doctors and para-medics, the number of positive cases in the State crossed 48,000 on Thursday. As many as 12 doctors — two senior and 10 resident doctors — have tested positive at the Patna All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS-P) alone. “Besides, 30 nurses and technicians, 20 cleaning staff and 12 administrative staff too have been infected,” Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer at the hospital, told The Hindu over phone. “The doctors who died are from Muzaffarpur, Rohtas, Gaya, Nalanda, Supaul, Patna and West Champaran districts,” said Sunil Kumar, State secretary of IMA. The State IMA chapter on Thursday issued an appeal to common people not to panic over cough, sneeze or fever in this monsoon season. “In case of any other symptoms and complications, they can contact the doctors named in our release,” Dr. Kumar said. Dr. Kumar expressed anger at the pathetic medical infrastructure in the State. “The condition is there for everyone to see… against 16,500 sanctioned posts of doctors, there are only 6,500 working here…Similarly there is an acute shortage of para-medics and nurses,” he said.  On Thursday, the government cleared the way for the appointment of 900 doctors. “But, out of these 900 doctors, 500 are already working on a contract basis…so where is the gap being filled?” said Dr. Kumar. “At a difficult time like this, we need senior doctors and experts to deal with the situation,” said a senior doctor at the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/11-doctors-in-bihar-died-of-covid-19/article32235620.ece

The Chief Minister said after Canada, the United Kingdom has now come out with a categorical statement that “it is not involved in any way in this unofficial and non-binding referendum… and considers Indian Punjab as part of India.” Welcoming the U.K.’s statement, the Chief Minister expressed surprise that Mr. Badal continues to turn a blind eye to the threat posed by Pakistan-backed Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) and other terrorist and radical forces working to destabilise India, particularly Punjab. “Can’t he [Mr. Badal] see that the arrests under UAPA which he is opposing are part of the State government’s strategy to combat this threat?” said Captain Amarinder, adding that it was unfortunate that instead of playing the role of a constructive opposition in the State, SAD was wasting its time with its baseless charges and comments. Hitting out at Mr. Badal for his latest remarks on the issue, in which he said “we won’t allow anyone to disturb the sentiment of fraternity, specially among Hindus and Sikhs”, the Chief Minister said it was the SAD chief who was, in fact, trying to create a divide between communities with his senseless attack on the State government’s attempts to check anti-Punjab forces from succeeding in their game plan. Meanwhile, Punjabi Ekta Party president Sukhpal Khaira on Thursday accused the ruling Congress government in Punjab and BJP-led government at Centre of misusing UAPA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/stop-political-theatrics-punjab-cm-tells-sad-chief/article32235837.ece

All three districts have been witnessing a rise in new infections in the past few weeks, even as the case count in Chennai slows down. As of July 30, Chengalpattu accounts for a total of 14,197 cases, of which 3,471 are active. Tiruvallur’s overall tally stood at 13,481, of which 3,937 are under treatment. Kancheepuram has a total of 8,604 cases as of now. Of these, 3,111 persons are under treatment. Health officials attributed the rise in cases to the testing of more samples and early detection similar to that being done in Chennai. “We have followed a Greater Chennai Corporation-like strategy by increasing the number of samples for testing. Earlier, our daily sample size was around 1,500. At present, it is about 3,000 and hence, we are getting more cases. In two days, we are trying to reach 6,000 samples per day,” an official of Chengalpattu district said. Every day, 80 to 83 medical camps are being conducted across Chengalpattu. In Tiruvallur, samples tested per day have increased over the last three weeks. “We used to lift 500 samples a day earlier. Now, the average sample size per day is 4,000,” a health official said. During the first week of July, there were 161 cases on an average in the district, while the average samples tested per day stood at 484. However, the average number of swabs tested per day increased to 3,877, coinciding with 328 cases on an average, during the third week of this month, he said. The district is conducting at least 50 satellite camps in areas where the prevalence of COVID-19 was more or clustering of cases was reported. Apart from screening persons with influenza-like illness, samples were lifted from persons with co-morbidities. “During the initial period, we had more cases from the Poonamallee and Avadi blocks. Now, cases are declining in these areas, while areas such as Minjur, Sholavaram, Gummidipoodi and Tiruttani are witnessing an increasing trend,” he said. In Kancheepuram, the number of samples tested was increased from 1,500 to 2,500 a day. Officials said 16 camps were organised every day in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/increased-testing-helps-detect-more-cases-in-nearby-districts/article32235737.ece

31 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu govt. releases norms for online learning||According to the guidelines for online education released by the Tamil Nadu government, each session may have 30-45 minutes of curricular delivery, and there should be a break of 10-15 minutes between each session so that children can rest their eyes and relax. For students of Classes 1-8, online classes may be undertaken for not more than two sessions a day and for students of Classes 9-12, not more than four sessions. For pre-primary classes, online classes cannot be scheduled; schools are encouraged to conduct online sessions of not more than 30 minutes to interact with the parents and guide them. Following an interim direction from the Madras High Court asking the government to come out with clear guidelines for online classes, the government has drawn up State-specific rules, factoring in the Pragyata guidelines issued by the Central government and the inputs from the School Education Commissioner, the Directors of School Education, matriculation schools and the State Council for Educational Research and Training. A government order with State-specific guidelines was issued on July 29 by School Education Department Secretary Dheeraj Kumar as an advisory. Seeking to address concerns over the digital divide, schools have been asked not to compel children to attend online classes and not to use terms such as ‘compulsory’ or say that it will be counted for attendance and grades because it may build feelings of stress or deprivation. While the guidelines state that schools can do assessments, they insist that none of the assessments be made mandatory or counted for the final grade or marking. Schools have been asked to plan activities keeping in mind the fact that students might have either minimum or maximum access to facilities to take part in online learning. While the guidelines state that schools should ensure that disadvantaged students, first-generation learners and children with special needs find opportunities to learn digitally, institutions have been asked to work out an alternate mode of education if this is not possible, and ensure that these students are given intense coaching after schools are reopened. The guidelines state that as far as possible, it is best to avoid separate learning groups for students with special needs and they should be treated on a par with their peers. In the event of online classes happening simultaneously for more than one child in a family, it has been suggested that schools informally establish a protocol that the elder child gets access to the device if there is a shortage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-govt-releases-norms-for-online-learning/article32235764.ece
31 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||World Bank will fund projects promoting physical distancing||The Greater Chennai Corporation and other line agencies are set to get funding from the World Bank for projects such as mega streets, evening clinics and additional MTC buses for tackling post-COVID-19 challenges. A meeting with World Bank officials was held this week, focusing on the need for infrastructure improvement. For instance, 110 km of mega streets, estimated to be worth Rs. 2,000 crore, are expected to provide non-motorised transport facilities suitable for physical distancing, officials said. Wide footpaths and public spaces will adopt a similar design. “After relaxation of the lockdown, fewer commuters will be allowed in public transit systems, including MTC buses. So, we need more buses designed for maintaining physical distancing,” an official said. “The city needs more evening clinics after the relaxation of the lockdown. The World Bank is looking at improving public health infrastructure in the city,” he said. Discussions held The World Bank and the Tamil Nadu government held deliberations this week on establishing the Chennai City Partnership. They discussed strengthening policies and institutional performance, enhancing service delivery through an integrated approach and strengthening sustainability of financing to comprehensively address urban transport and mobility challenges. “We have narrowed down on the following: establishing a metropolitan vision for the city, strengthening governance and institutions, achieving sustainable mobility through an integrated multi-modal system and establishing sustainable funding and financing mechanisms,” another official said. The Corporation, over the years, has made great progress in urban mobility, civic officials said. With a non-motorised transport policy adopted in 2014, the civic body has transformed over 120 km of streets into pedestrian- friendly. The civic body also recently launched a study on the Mega Streets Project, aimed at transforming six areas into world-class neighbourhoods. “One of the projects the World Bank was interested in is the Mega Street Project, estimated to be worth Rs. 2,000 crore. They want the safe city street design guidelines to be adopted by all agencies, including the Highways Department. They are also looking at women’s safety,” an official said.

31 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Devise mechanism to provide sanitary napkins to girls’||The Madras High Court on Thursday granted time till Monday for the State government to come up with a mechanism for distributing sanitary napkins to girls who are not able to access vending machines due to the closure of schools during the COVID-19 lockdown. Justices M.M. Sundresh and R. Hemalatha took serious note of the issue during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition filed by advocate R. Sudha. Her counsel Vasudha Thiagarajan said napkins were highly necessary for young girls to maintain hygiene. Since most government schools have remained shut since March 17, there is no way the poor girls are able to access the napkins, provided free in schools. Their parents were not in a position to spend money on napkins, the petitioner pointed out. When she added that schoolchildren were missing the nutritious meal provided at schools, the judges directed a Special Government Pleader to find out the feasibility of providing eggs and vitamin C and D tablets or supplements to students. Though the Social Welfare Secretary had already filed a counter affidavit stating that the supply of eggs on a daily basis was not found feasible and the government had decided to give dry rations in schools, the judges said that something more nutritious should also be provided.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/devise-mechanism-to-provide-sanitary-napkins-to-girls/article32235762.ece

Ajith Kumar, a bodybuilder, used to earn a living working as a personal trainer in a gym. Now, he does odd jobs to make ends meet as gyms are closed. “I was hoping that gyms will open in Tamil Nadu too as part of Unlock 3. But there was no announcement about the same. I have to again start working as a food delivery boy,” he said. Mr. Kumar won the gold medal in the recently-held Junior Mr. India competition in Andhra Pradesh. Noor Ahmed Khan, strength and conditioning coach and rehab specialist, now helps his father in his business. “Even my father’s business is affected now. Many of my clients have discontinued fearing the spread of COVID-19,” he said. There are more than 7,200 gyms in the State, with Chennai alone accounting for 3,000 of them. Struggling without regular income, many trainers, gymnasium owners and bodybuilders want the government to provide compensation and rent subsidy. “All of us were hoping that gyms will open in August. We understand that the government is concerned about containing the spread of the virus. But our profession has been hit badly. We are unable to pay rent, EMI and even our trainers,” said M. Arasu, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Amateur Body Building Association (TABBA).  Hopes dashed He said that several gym owners were on the verge of quitting the field, unable to pay rent and salaries. “Trainers have started working as loaders and are selling vegetables. Many are depressed as they are unable to earn a living the way they used to,” he said. TABBA members have written to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami seeking compensation. “If the government allows us to function, we will follow all safety measures in the gyms,” added Mr. Arasu.

The PG online admission process is currently in session and students were expected to report to the college by July 31. However, following a representation from the Rajasthan government and the private medical colleges in Bihar seeking extension of last date for admission to PG medical courses, the court extended the last date for admission up to August 31 for the academic year 2020-21. Relief to students This has come as a relief for many PG students who were worried about not being able to report to the colleges in just a day. “Even more worrying was how candidates, who had been admitted to a course in a self-financing college, would pay the penalty if they chose to opt out of the programme,” said A. Saminathan, general secretary of Service Doctors and Post Graduates Association. The list was released on Wednesday and 525 students were asked to join by Thursday. “The Supreme Court order came as a relief for the students,” Dr. Saminathan said.

31 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||20,204 temples opened while 21,131 remain shut, says HR&CE||The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department on Thursday informed the Madras High Court that only 20,204 small temples situated in villages and other rural areas and with an annual revenue below Rs. 10,000 had been opened for public worship despite the lockdown in force across the State to fight COVID-19. Justices M.M. Sundresh and R. Hemalatha were told that 21,131 big as well as small temples situated in cities as well as rural areas remained closed. The submission was made in response to a query raised by the High Court during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition.

The PIL petition was filed by R.R. Gopaljee, publisher of Tamil daily Dinamalar (Tiruchi-Vellore editions) seeking financial assistance to all employees dependent on temples for their income without discriminating between those who had been engaged on payment of salaries and those who were dependent on offerings by the devotees.

31 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Incentive for farmers to grow organic vegetables||The Tamil Nadu government has planned to incentivise farmers who grow vegetables through organic farming. An incentive, ranging from Rs. 2,500 per hectare to Rs. 5,000 per hectare, will be offered, depending upon the crop. As many as 60,000 farmers will benefit. A sum of Rs. 15 crore has been set aside, and a government order is expected to be issued shortly, according to an official of the Agriculture Department. The aim is to promote organic cultivation of vegetables such as greens, brinjal, cabbage, ladies’ fingers and cauliflower. In terms of area, the target is to achieve around 76,000 acres or 30,850 hectares this year, though the aim is one lakh acres (about 40,470 hectares). At present, according to an estimate, the total extent of organic farming in the State is about 65,610 acres (approximately 26,550 hectares). However, the official hints that the actual coverage may be much higher. “What you should keep in mind is that for our calculation, we don’t take into account non-vegetables or millets which are being grown in dry-land areas, where organic farming is being followed in one form or the other. “If you add all these areas, the area under organic cultivation will also go up. But our focus is on vegetables, which are directly consumed by people,” the official says. As of now, five major organic vegetable growing districts are The Nilgiris (1,287 hectares); Coimbatore (77 hectares); Dindigul (55 hectares); Namakkal (49 hectares); and Tiruppur (47 hectares). The official says the district-level Assistant Directors (Seed Certification) have also been given the responsibility of organic certification, and they are re-designated accordingly. Earlier, there were only four officers who were authorised to issue certification. Now, with the increase in the number of certification officers, the process has been made easier for farmers who want to do organic farming. Besides, the officers will be engaged in organic farming promotional activities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/incentive-for-farmers-to-grow-organic-vegetables/article32235772.ece
31 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Political parties in T.N. want NEP withdrawn||The DMK on Thursday demanded the withdrawal of the new National Education Policy (NEP), saying it was against the Indian Constitution and the interest of the student community. The party also urged the AIADMK government to adopt a resolution against the NEP 2020 on the ground that it was against the rights of the State government and social justice. “The government should say that there was no place for three-language policy and the two-language policy proposed by late Chief Minister C.N. Annadurai would continue,” said a resolution adopted at a virtual meeting of DMK district secretaries, MLAs and MPs chaired by party leader M.K. Stalin on Thursday. The DMK described as “anti-democratic” the approval given by the Union Cabinet to the NEP when all the States were in the grip of COVID-19 pandemic and the Parliament was not in session to allow people’s representatives to discuss it. The meeting made a strong case for keeping in abeyance the NEP till it was discussed by the Parliament and all State political parties. The meeting said the NEP was totally against the recommendations advanced by the DMK and it was unacceptable that even kindergarten syllabus would be decided by the Centre. Convene all-party meet Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi president and Chidambaram MP Thol. Thirumavalavan on Thursday urged the State government to reject the NEP. He exhorted Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to call for an all-party meeting to express the State’s opposition to the Centre’s new policy. In a statement, he said the Centre had announced the policy which took away the autonomy of States and attempted to give a saffron tinge to education, that too at the time of a pandemic. “It must be rejected,” he said. Expressing his disapproval of the new education policy, the general secretary of the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam T.T.V. Dhinakaran felt that the Centre had acted in haste in bringing out the Policy. He wanted the State government to follow those aspects of the NEP which would promote intellectual development of students of the State, leaving out features which would be harmful to the interests of the student community. ‘Bid to saffronise education’ The National Education Policy 2020 is an attempt to saffronise education and will divide the people of the country on the basis of religion, alleged TNCC president K.S. Alagiri on Thursday. In a statement in Chennai, he said it should not be implemented without discussion in Parliament. Mr. Alagiri claimed the policy was an attempt to communalise education and cause danger to the ideas of secularism. “Despite scholars and educationists opposing the policy, the Centre has not considered them and taken a decision against it,” he said. Mr. Alagiri said the policy also aimed to force Sanskrit on the people of the country. The Tamil Nadu government is now facing a situation where it has to decide whether the third language in the State will be Sanskrit or Hindi or some other language. “The Centre is trying to force its ideology of One Nation, One language, One culture through this,” he alleged. PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss on Thursday said though the new NEP approved by the Union Cabinet had many good aspects, there are many aspects which are dangerous too. In a statement, he pointed out the proposal that students in classes 3, 5 and 8 would take school examinations to be conducted by the appropriate authority was not needed. Similarly, he pointed out the proposal of adopting a three language policy is not acceptable. Mr. Anbumani urged the government to remove the dangerous aspects in the policy and include proactive measures suggested by the 1964, Kothari Commission. Vasan, Kamal welcome policy Meanwhile, Tamil Maanila Congress president G.K. Vasan welcomed the NEP 2020 and said the future generation will benefit from it. Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan on Thursday welcomed the new education policy’s proposal that 6% of GDP would be spent on education.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/political-parties-in-tn-want-nep-withdrawn/article32235746.ece

Advocate General Vijay Narayan told a Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and R. Hemalatha that the State government had so far not taken any decision on implementing the EWS quota in its institutions and hence, the Tahsildars had been instructed to specifically mention that the certificates could be used only for jobs and education in central institutes. When the counsel for one of the petitioners pointed out that some States like Telangana had decided to implement the EWS quota even in State government institutions, the Advocate General replied that it was for those States to either accept or reject the income/wealth certificates issued by Tahsildars in Tamil Nadu if people from here choose to apply.

B. Sabarinath, president of Coimbatore Jewellers’ Association, said gold prices on Thursday evening in Coimbatore was Rs. 5,093 per gram for 22 carat gold and Rs. 5,515 a gram for 24 carat. The demand is less for jewellery. However, sales is better this week compared to last week. Most of the buyers want to buy coins. “They want to lock the investment. They are likely to convert the coins into jewellery at a later date,” he said. According to B. Muthuvenkatraman, president of Coimbatore Jewellery Manufacturers’ Association, though all the cities have opened up, the demand for jewellery is still less. There are hardly any orders for the manufacturers here, even from the northern States. The market is yet to stabilise, he said. However, S.M. Kamal Hasan, president of Coimbatore Goldsmiths’ Association, said the orders for goldsmithies have increased in the recent weeks. If a goldsmith got orders for 300 gm gold a week before the spread of COVID-19, it is for 900 gm now. “We do not have people to make the jewellery. The orders are mainly for traditional items such as studs and drops,” he said. “Gold rates are expected to go up further in the coming months. We expect orders to be high even then,” he said. Chennai was the main market for jewellery. Now that it is closed and flight services are restricted, orders from other parts of Tamil Nadu are coming to Coimbatore, which is a major manufacturing centre. That is keeping the smithies busy, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/investments-in-gold-coins-up-with-increasing-prices-in-coimbatore/article32235788.ece

The palate of the elephant had a wound which the Forest Department and veterinarians suspect that it would have suffered in a fight with another male elephant. Sources with the Department said that frontline staff spotted the elephant in ailing condition a few days ago. The staff could not approach the tusker as other elephants were in its vicinity. Other elephants in the herd chased Forest Department staff on Wednesday. The staff resumed search for the ailing elephant on Thursday and they found it lying on the ground at Sundapatti section of Nellithurai reserve forest. An assistant veterinary surgeon from Thekkampatti administered fluids till A. Sugumar, forest veterinary officer for Coimbatore forest division, reached the spot. The veterinarians found a wound on the left palate of the elephant. “The tusker seems to have suffered the wound in the fight with another elephant. Locking of tusks during a fight can inflict such wounds,” said a Forest Department official. The elephant had difficulty in consuming food and water due to the wound from which maggots were removed. The veterinarians administered 32 bottles of glucose. Around 40 litres of water was also given through rectal hydration. Veterinarians were waiting for signs of revival after the treatment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/forest-dept-begins-treatment-for-tusker/article32235782.ece

Paramasivam, District President of theTamil Nadu Tribal Association, said in his petition that nearly 500 students from various tribal settlements have been unable to access online classes or televised lessons via Kalvi TV introduced by the State government due to lack of electricity or smartphones. Mr. Paramasivam told The Hindu that the special classes can be arranged in the schools located within the 17 tribal settlements of ATR. These classes could be conducted by adhering to personal distancing, he suggested. “Without classes, the future of education of these students will be uncertain,” he said. When contacted, Coimbatore Chief Educational Officer P. Usha said that the headmasters of all the government schools with students from tribal communities across Coimbatore district have been asked to prepare a list of students who are unable to access the online and televised classes. “Once the list is finalised, we shall take action,” she said. Meanwhile, any particular grievances could be addressed in coordination with the Block Resource Teacher Educators concerned, Ms. Usha said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/arrange-special-classes-for-tribal-students/article32235789.ece

31 July 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||1.39 lakh tests conducted in MMC laboratory so far||Of the 1.39 lakh swabs tested till date at the Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory in Madurai Medical College, 6,666 tested positive, said Government Rajaji Hospital Dean J. Sangumani here on Thursday. He told reporters that a record high of 4,700 samples were tested on a single day on July 28. “There are six RT-PCR machines and three RNA extraction machines with the GRH,” he said. Those who have given samples for tests can download a certificate of the result from the MMC’s website from Saturday. Till now, patients can check their test results online and an SMS was sent to their mobile phones. “Six patients who recovered from COVID-19 have donated plasma and it was used to treat five patients. We have asked for setting up a plasma bank at the GRH,” he said. M. Natarajan, Head, Department of General Medicine, said the number of admissions at GRH had come down. “On Wednesday, there were only 90 admissions, against the 150 to 170 earlier,” he said. He clarified that best possible treatment was provided to a 71-year-old patient, who recently died due to COVID-19. A WhatsApp audio in which he had complained about poor treatment at GRH was widely circulated. The patient was admitted on July 12. After two days, he went to a private hospital and after four days, he was referred back to GRH as oxygen saturation reached 70. “We treated him at the Intensive Care Unit. We initially treated him with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Since he did not cooperate, he was treated with non-invasive ventilation and finally mechanical ventilation. All doctors and nurses worked with full determination. But it was disheartening to hear the audio,” he said. Dr. Sangumani said that out of 770 beds with oxygen lines in the GRH, 365 beds were occupied. “We have been ramping up the oxygen capacity to meet requirements of patients. In July, 1.63 lakh litres of liquid oxygen was utilised to provide support to patients,” he said. High-flow nasal cannulas were used to treat patients. A separate committee has been formed to control the number of attendants or caregivers of patients. “The caregivers are stamped on their hands to ensure that they do not move out of the hospital,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/139-lakh-tests-conducted-in-mmc-laboratory-so-far/article32236100.ece

31 July 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC orders re-postmortem in farmer’s death case||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday ordered a re-postmortem to be conducted on the body of the Tenkasi farmer who had allegedly died in the custody of Forest Department personnel. The earlier postmortem was not proper as it was conducted at night. The court was hearing a petition filed by Palammal, who alleged that her husband Anaikarai Muthu died due to torture meted out by the Forest Department personnel. It was said that he was picked up for inquiry on the charge of tapping electricity illegally. Since the earlier postmortem was conducted at night she had sought a re-postmortem to be conducted as per norms. Justice R. Pongiappan observed that the Madras High Court had held that if night postmortems were held, there may be a chance for miscarriage of justice and it would lead to confusion over cause of death. The Tamil Nadu Medical Code ( Volume 1) had stated that completing post mortem in night hours was not advisable. “The post mortem has to be done in the presence of sunlight because colour of injury under tubelight, CFL, LED’s and other artificial illumination appears to be purple rather than red and as per forensic science, there is no mention of purple injury and wound. However, in some emergencies and special conditions/ occasions such as terrorism or events like disasters, forensic doctors probably perform post mortem during night and evening,” the judge said. The court refused to accept the State’s argument that the post mortem was conducted at night to avoid law and order problem. The State had argued that the family had resorted to a sit in agitation. The court observed that nowadays gathering of public after such occurrences was a normal one. The judge directed a team of experts from Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi government medical college hospitals to conduct the post mortem between sunrise and sunset and the same should be videographed. He directed the petitioner to accept the body as her grievance was redressed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-orders-re-postmortem-in-farmers-death-case/article32236114.ece
31 July 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||MLA wants testing facility to be ramped up||Rajapalayam MLA S. Thangapandian has said inadequate testing capacity in Virudhunagar district has caused the spread of COVID-19 infection. “When the district administration is claiming that it is collecting 2,000 to 2,500 samples each day, it has a capacity to test only around 1,000 samples. Taking the samples to private labs is causing the delay,” the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam MLA said. Recalling that his result from the private lab for the swab given at the Government hospital here came with an inordinate delay of eight days, Mr. Thangapandian said it defeated the very purpose of increased testing. Mr. Thangapandian, who was admitted to a private hospital in Madurai, got discharged only on Wednesday. “Government says early detection will help in isolating the patients and prevent further spreading of the infection. But, if results do not come within 24 hours, it is bound to spread infection as the infected person would keep on meeting people,” he added. Stating that his was not the only case, the MLA said that even the Chief Medical Officer of GH in Rajapalayam faced the same problem. His result came six days after the testing, the MLA said. “Why should the Government depend on private labs and allow them to make money in this troubled times? Why is the Government not increasing the testing capacity in GHs?” Mr. Thangapandian asked.. Stating that he was ready to allocate necessary funds from MLA Local Area Development Fund, he said the district administration should come forward to set up the second testing centre at Rajapalayam GH. However, Virudhunagar Collector R. Kannan said the samples were being sent only to Government IRT Perundurai Medical College hospital and the results were coming within 24 hours these days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mla-wants-testing-facility-to-be-ramped-up/article32236093.ece

31 July 2020||NAGERCOIL,TAMIL NADU||Saffron cloth tied to Anna statue triggers tension||Tension prevailed in the western Kanniyakumari town of Kuzhithurai for a while on Thursday after miscreants tied a saffron cloth and heaped trash on the pedestal of the life-size statue of late Chief Minister and founder of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam C.N. Annadurai. Though the Kaliyakkavilai police, after analysing the video footage collected from the CCTV cameras installed in nearby shops, detained a man in this connection, who they said was mentally unstable, the protesting DMK cadre, led by Padmanabapuram MLA Mano Thangaraj, termed it as an attempt to divert a “highly contentious issue” for obvious political reasons. Passersby first saw the piece of saffron cloth fluttering from the pedestal of Anna statue at Kuzhithurai junction. They also found broken helmets, used electric bulbs and dried garlands etc. heaped in front of the statue, reportedly maintained by the DMK. As the news spread, the DMK cadre gathered near the statue and staged a dharna. Raising slogans demanding the arrest of those involved in the “desecration” of the statue, the protesting DMK functionaries said a group working to trigger clashes among different political parties and people following different political ideologies to gain political mileage was indulging in such mean acts. “After giving religious colour to sage Tiruvalluvar by draping the statue with saffron cloth and splashing saffron paints on the statue of late Periyar and M.G. Ramachandran, the miscreants, who do not believe in social equality and wish to spread religious hatred, have now targeted Anna. Those vandalising the statues of Tiruvalluvar, Periyar and Anna, who always preached and practised equality, should be mentally-ill requiring medical treatment and counselling,” Mr. Mano Thangaraj said. “The police should arrest the real culprits,” Mr. Mano Thangaraj added.  Ramadoss, TTV flay act PMK founder S. Ramadoss condemned the act of tying saffron cloth to the statue of Annadurai in Kuzhithurai. In a tweet, he termed it as hate politics. “Ideology must be faced and opposed by ideology. By tying a flag to Anna, his ideology cannot be changed.” The general secretary of the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam T.T.V.

31 July 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry govt. medical college running out of beds||With the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Research Institute (IGGMC&RI), the lone COVID-19 care centre directly under the control of the territorial administration, slowly running out of beds, the focus has now shifted towards establishing additional capacity in private medical colleges and venues outside the healthcare sector. With a total bed capacity of 500 at the IGGMC&RI, the hospital already has 474 COVID-19 patients undergoing treatment. The other dedicated Centre-run Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (Jipmer) COVID-19 centre has around 300 beds, of which 150 are already occupied, said a senior Health Department official. According to the official, there is also a plan to convert the Rajiv Gandhi Women and Child Hospital into another COVID- 19 centre. But converting the hospital for treating infected patients could turn out to be another health crisis as the institute caters to around 250 out-patients, performs 30-40 surgeries, a similar number of emergency cases and attends to 100-150 casualty cases, both maternity and paediatric, every day. The government will have to find an alternative healthcare facility for maternity and paediatric cases, the official said. “Now we are getting 120-130 cases a day, on average. This is likely to go up in the coming days. Our own estimate is that by the end of next month, we will have around 4,500-6,000 cases,” said a senior doctor. The other alternative would be to add more beds in the six private medical colleges. As on Wednesday, 213 patients were admitted to these hospitals, the maximum at the Pondicherry Institute of Medical Sciences. Initially, the government requested private medical colleges to part with 100 beds each, but after seeing the spike in cases the colleges have been asked to set aside 200-300 beds. “The biggest challenge will be to fix the rates in private colleges,” said an official. “The government is also considering incurring a part of the cost of the treatment at private colleges to reduce the burden on the people, especially the economically underprivileged,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/puducherry-govt-medical-college-running-out-of-beds/article32235758.ece

31 July 2020||Rameswaram,TAMIL NADU||Mechanised boat rams Pamban bridge||A mechanised fishing boat reportedly rammed the Pamban rail bridge on Wednesday night. On information, a team of officials from the Railways and Marine Police here inspected the area on Thursday morning. An officer, who was part of the probe team, said that a fishing boat owned by Antony Rajkumar of Thoothukudi, was carrying about 10 fishermen. They had set off to the sea for fishing from Mandapam on Wednesday evening. As there was no big catch in and around Mandapam, the fishermen had planned to move towards Tharuvaikulam off Thoothukudi. As they were approaching the Pamban rail bridge, the head of the boat hit a portion underneath the bridge. Due to the collision, the boat got stuck and could not move forward. After an hour or so, the fishermen succeeded by detaching the boat from the bridge. The reason and extent of the damage was not immediately known. According to the fishermen, due to heavy wind, the accident had occurred. All the fishermen were safe. A Marine Police said that sometime in December 2019, a mechanised boat had rammed the Pamban bridge and as a result, there were some delays in movement of trains. The Department of Fisheries official, who inspected the site, said that due to gutsy wind, the incident may have happened. The mechanised boat has been anchored on the northern side of the shore. Further investigation is on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mechanised-boat-rams-pamban-bridge/article32236092.ece

31 July 2020||Tenkasi,TAMIL NADU||Courtallam in full flow but no tourist in sight||Water is flowing in all the waterfalls at Courtallam. But it wears a deserted look due to the lockdown. The annual season between June and August is crucial for many as the money they earn during this period would feed their families for the remaining days. Though the traders get decent business during the ‘Ayyappa season’ between mid-November and mid-January, it is the 90-day-long season that is the mainstay in their lives. But traders are finding the going tough now. Autorickshaw drivers and platform traders, who would be working almost round-the-clock during the 90 days every year, have left their profession and are working as construction labourers. Catering and cottage contractors are the next worst-hit as the cottages they have hired for ‘Season 2020’ have dented them financially. Normally, most of the contractors would renew in April or May lease of houses in Courtallam and surroundings, each having 2 to 5 bedrooms that can ensure pleasant stay for tourists coming in small groups. Though they have expressed their inability to the owners of these houses that they would not be able to give the lease amount this year, contractors have to pay the electricity bill for these houses and other maintenance. “Since commercial tariff is being collected for these houses, I had to pay Rs. 7,000 as electricity bill for each house as it was calculated based on what I paid during this period last year,” says contractor Shenbagam of Courtallam. These contractors also turn caterers serving a range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes with local flavour. “We’ve seen ups and downs in the past due to unimpressive season (due to scanty rainfall). But this year our business has been virtually destroyed. Whatever we’d spent on maintenance of houses we’ve hired will not give any returns this year,” says Thirumalai, another contractor. Traders who used to hire shops near the waterfalls are holding talks with the Courtallam Town Panchayat to waive the rent for this lockdown period. Courtallam is also know for fruits like rambutan, egg fruit, mangosteen, mangoes, durian, jack, star fruit, berries, plum, guava etc. The display of fruits under attractive lights was usually a treat to watch. As most of these are cultivated in the Western Ghats, tourists would make it a point to buy the fruits while leaving for their destinations. Since demand for the fruits goes up during the season, over a hundred big fruit shops would be seen in Courtallam and along the roads leading to Five Falls, Old Falls, Tiger Falls, Shencottai and Puliyarai. Fruit sellers, whose livelihood has been badly hit, have now erected roadside shops on both sides of Tenkasi – Madurai Highway. “Sale is dull this year. We’re selling fruits from a new place with the hope that what we earn now will save our families from starvation. The pandemic should end at the earliest,” says K. Murugan, a fruit-seller from Kasimajorpuram near Courtallam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/courtallam-in-full-flow-but-no-tourist-in-sight/article32236096.ece
31 July 2020||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||‘Don’t close down Ammapettai railway station’||The Ammapettai Union Committee of the Communist Party of India has called upon Southern Railway not to close down Ammapettai railway station.

31 July 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Bakrid festival shopping takes a big hit||Even though sales promotions forAadiand the run-up to Eid al-Adha (also known as Bakrid) have coincided this year, it has been a quiet time for most shoppers in the city. The nationwide lockdown and ban on large gatherings has led to muted celebrations, with garment shopping taking a big hit. “The crowds usually start coming around 10 days before Bakrid, but the lockdown and travel restrictions have forced many people to stay away,” a representative at Pathanjali Silks, toldThe Hindu. “We do have promotions forAadias well, but the number of visitors has come down drastically compared to last year.” While festive shopping fior clothing is usually centred around personal wear, saris andlungisare bought in bulk quantities as charitable donations during Bakrid . “This year, we have our usual synthetic sari collections [in the price range of Rs. 200-Rs. 300] for those who want to gift them to their staff or needy people, but they have not moved much,” he said. Tiruchi is a major hub for clothes shopping, especially for those in nearby towns and villages. In recent years, the practice of groups of shoppers booking mini-buses or vans from places like Thanjavur or Perambalur for a day-trip to Tiruchi’s clothing retailers has been popular. This year, though, the hassle of getting e-passes has put paid to such trips. But ‘video shopping’ has replaced the physical shopping experience. “Video shopping, which is done in real-time, through WhatsApp calls, has become popular among our outstation customers,” said a senior manager from Pothys. Buyers have to register through a helpline in order to be guided by a salesman through the store’s collection in a video call. “Once they have made their selection, buyers can pay through electronic transfer or cash on delivery, depending on their location,” he added. Despite the total lockdown on Sundays affecting textile sales, many people still prefer to shop directly, said an official from Chennai Silks. “Most of the clothes are being bought for personal use, but there is sizeable interest in costlier garments suitable for special occasions like weddings,” he said. “Some people are taking advantage of the Aadi sales to buy ahead for auspicious days in the month of Aavani this week,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bakrid-festival-shopping-takes-a-big-hit/article32236135.ece

31 July 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Meat becomes expensive for many||Sacrificing goats and other livestock is one of the many practices associated with Eid al-Adha, or Bakrid, the festival that is held on the 10th day of the Arab lunar month of ‘Dhul-Hijjah’, and is due to be celebrated this weekend in India. Distribution of the sacrificial meat is three-fold, with one share each for the poor, relatives and friends, and for home use. The ritual keeps many butchers busy for at least four days since Bakrid is declared, as many families stagger their animal sacrifice to ensure minimum wastage. The ban on livestock shandies due to the lockdown has compelled many observant Muslims to redirect the funds kept for this purpose, to other charitable activities. “Instead of buying goats this year, many people have decided to transfer money electronically to needy people, to help them buy essential goods like rice and cooking oil,” a homemaker toldThe Hindu. Others have pooled in their resources to buy ‘shares’ in a bigger animal like a cow, that will be sacrificed in another village. “Last year, we had people queuing up to buy herds of goats for as much as Rs. 25,000 per animal, but nobody has that kind of liquidity this Bakrid,” said S.M. Mohamed Bilal, a meat seller in Puthur. “A 10-kilo goat costs around Rs. 10,000 this year. However, people are buying pre-cut meat in smaller quantities for festive cooking and gifting during lockdown,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/meat-becomes-expensive-for-many/article32236137.ece

Ramakrishnan, assistant professor at the Department of Zoology and Wildlife Biology at the Government Arts College in Udhagamandalam, feels the main goal of the centre should be to establish the facilities required to treat vultures in distress. “Over the last decade, we have lost 15-20 vultures as we did not possess the required facilities or expertise to intervene when we came across vultures in distress,” he says. “It is painful to see a vulture in distress, maybe, owing to poisoning or some other injury, and being unable to intervene effectively and save it. As there are so few vultures left in south India, conserving each one gains more importance,” argues Mr. Ramakrishnan, who has been studying the population and nesting habits of vultures in the landscape for the last few years. The centre is also expected to help improve the rate of survival of vulture fledglings. “In some cases, we have recorded fledglings falling out of their nests. Though this is natural, a rescue and rehabilitation centre could have a dedicated aviary where these fledglings can be nursed back to health and released in the wild, further bolstering the population,” he says. The Sigur plateau is one of the last remaining bastions for three species of the critically endangered vultures in south India: the white-rumped vulture ( Gyps bengalensis) , the red-headed or Asian king vulture ( Sarcogyps calvus)  and the long-billed vulture ( Gyps indicus) . Moreover, the other species, including the Egyptian vulture, the Cinereous vulture and the Himalayan griffon vulture, have also been recorded visiting the landscape occasionally. L.C.S. Srikanth, Deputy Director, MTR (buffer zone), says the nesting patterns of the vultures in the plateau is healthy, with another successful breeding season having been completed earlier this year. “There is also a plan to have a breeding centre in the reserve, so that we can further bolster the vulture population in the region.” “However, before we go in for a dedicated breeding programme, studies will have to be conducted to ascertain the carrying capacity of the landscape for the vulture population, and whether the region can support a much higher density of the birds,” he says. MTR field director K.K.Kaushal is enthusiastic about the plan. “Establishing a facility here will definitely go some way in ensuring the continued survival of the vultures in south India. The MTR is one of the last strongholds in this region for most of the vultures... So, such a facility will help bolster their population, which is dwindling across the country,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mudumalai-tiger-reserve-plans-a-centre-to-protect-vultures/article32235780.ece

Assistant City Health Officer S. Vinodh Raja said 260 patients were under home isolation in the city limits as on Thursday. The civic body has been disposing of the biomedical waste of those under home isolation based on a set of guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board. Green bags are given to every positive patient under home quarantine to dump biomedical waste. Conservancy workers collect them from the houses on pre-determined days. “First the bag is completely disinfected using liquid disinfectant and bleaching powder. Then the conservancy worker picks up the bag and places it inside one of the bins earmarked for biomedical waste in their vehicle. Once again, the whole bin is completely disinfected,” said a Corporation Sanitary Officer. All conservancy workers have been given face masks and hand gloves to ensure their safety, he said. Mr. Raja said the bags are then given to the respective Urban Primary Health Centres from where they were picked up and incinerated at a Common Biomedical Waste Treatment Facility in Virudhunagar. In some wards, Sanitary Inspectors said they dumped the collected biomedical waste into dumper bins designated in all four zones. “Based on a fixed schedule, the contractor picks up the waste for incineration,” said a Sanitary Inspector. An employee from the treatment facility said biomedical waste from those under home isolation would mostly include face masks, hand gloves and used instruments. “Only in the recent past has the biomedical waste from those under home isolation has increased. But safety measures are adopted as caution is the key during such times,” the Sanitary Inspector said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/biomedical-waste-from-houses-incinerated/article32236103.ece

Officials said that Manikandan (48), resident of Krishnaswamy Nagar near Ramanathapuram, and his son Sanjay (27) were arrested based on complaints lodged by investors. They said that the accused ran a company named Green Crest Investment at Krishnaswamy Nagar. Around 50 investors besieged the house of Manikandan on Wednesday, accusing the duo of cheating them. The EOW registered a case based on a complaint lodged by them and arrested the accused. A senior officer with the EOW said that the accused promised investors a daily return of 0.5% interest for their investment on all working days. They were asked to get their principal amount after 11 months, said the officer. The firm also offered various levels of referral income to investors. The investors complained to the police that the accused defaulted payment of the principal amount and the interest at various levels. According to EOW, preliminary investigations revealed that the accused cheated at least 1,000 of about Rs. 60 crore. During investigation, EOW found photos of Manikandan with a retired cricketer. However, it was not clear whether they used those photos for marketing. The father and son were produced before a magistrate and remanded in judicial custody late on Wednesday. The agency was expecting complaints from more investors following the arrest of the company directors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-held-for-duping-investors/article32235809.ece

Counselling and rehabilitation is difficult as the children, who are unable to venture outdoors, are being coaxed by parents at home, they say. Since January, 74 child marriages have been prevented in Tiruchi district. In 15 cases, the girls were rescued after the ceremony. However, a sharp increase has been noticed during the lockdown, with 61 of the 74 cases recorded between April and July, says M. Thameemunisa, District Social Welfare Officer, Tiruchi. Closure of schools is a factor, says Murali Kumar, Project Coordinator of Childline-1098 in Tiruchi. “Parents pay no heed to their children’s wishes. Girls as young as 15 are being coaxed to get married since they are at home and not attending school.” Detection has become easy after former Tiruchi DIG V. Balakrishnan’s directive to all-women police stations in the district to submit daily report of such cases. Police have hastened the filing of FIRs and also issue warnings to the families, Mr. Kumar says. Schools and public gatherings serve as a means to create awareness which is absent now. “We are unable to reach children and provide counselling. Although our helpline continues to ring, we are unable to register our physical presence and create awareness among children,” he rues. Emergency counselling after a child rescue, however, is necessary and it is being conducted, he adds. Collector S. Sivarasu has warned of stern action against those organising child marriages and assists in conducting them. Members of the public must report to the District Social Welfare Office if they come across any incidents of child marriage. They can also register complaints on 1098 Childline number.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/spike-in-child-marriages-in-tiruchi-district/article32236141.ece

31 July 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Some pvt. hospitals have handed over only 10% beds against mandated 50%||At a time when the clash between private hospitals and the State government over bed allotment is showing no sign of resolution, the seven teams of IAS and IPS officers set up to inspect private hospitals have brought to the notice of the government that some hospitals are “manipulating” bed availability. Tushar Girinath, State’s nodal officer for streamlining bed availability, told The Hindu that private hospitals have so far shared with the government only 1,200 beds of the nearly 13,000 available, which is less than 10%. “This means, the remaining beds are being used for their walk-in COVID-19 and non-COVID patients. Their claim of beds not being available is not justifiable,” he said. “Although beds are mathematically available — going by the bed strength in each of the bigger hospitals — they are not available on ground. The hospitals claim that their bed strength mentioned during the KPME registration is not the actual figure. So, we had asked the seven teams of IAS and IPS officers to inspect each hospital and verify their admission data. They have been asked to find out from the hospital admission registers the highest number of occupied beds at any point of time. This will give us a picture of the actual bed strength,” he said. The initial indication is of a possible manipulation in some cases. The official said the government was mulling over stringent action against such hospitals under the KPME and the National Disaster Management Acts that can include levy of heavy penalties and even cancellation of registration. However, R. Ravindra, president of the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, said, “It is practically not possible to hand over 50% of beds in each hospital for government-referred patients. How do we accommodate walk-in COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, and non-COVID-19 patients in the remaining 50% beds? Also, several of our hospital staff are turning positive and we have to admit and treat them too.” Plight of other patients Meanwhile, the hardest hit in this tussle seem to be non-COVID-19 patients. What has aggravated the situation is the fact that most government hospitals have also been converted into exclusive COVID-19 facilities. This has meant that non-COVID-19 patients depend heavily on private hospitals. While the State has been insisting that private hospitals should allot 50% of their beds for government referred COVID-19 patients, private hospitals argue that it is practically not possible to do so. The hospital heads say that they are willing to set aside 50% of their bed strength for overall COVID-19 patients, including government-referred ones and walk-ins, leaving the remaining half for treatment of other illnesses and suspected cases. Dr. Ravindra contended that private hospitals had been repeatedly trying to bring the issue of shortage of beds for non-COVID-19 patients and suspected cases to the notice of the government. “I even raised this during the meeting with the Chief Minister. We will again write to the government on this issue. There should be a rethink on the government’s directive. We need to sort out this issue on an urgent basis to ensure non-COVID-19 patients get timely treatment,” added Dr. Ravindra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/some-pvt-hospitals-have-handed-over-only-10-beds-against-mandated-50/article32235681.ece

Both Mr. Kumaraswamy and Mr. Shivakumar want the BJP government under B.S. Yediyurappa to stay in power for the next three years, he claimed. Unable to deal with the dominance of Mr. Shivakumar and his brother and MP D.K. Suresh in Ramanagaram district, Mr. Kumaraswamy had gone soft on the BJP government for the last one year, Mr. Yogeshwar said. The brothers have been dominating in Ramanagaram district administration by securing power in the city municipal council and taluk panchayat. This has resulted in a tussle for dominance in the region between Mr. Shivakumar and Mr. Kumaraswamy, said the BJP leader. Fearing loss of control over the district, Mr. Kumaraswamy has been “supporting” the government. “Indirectly, Mr. Kumaraswamy completely supports the government,” he said. Mr. Yogeshwar appealed to the voters of the district to support the BJP, instead of either Mr. Shivakumar or Mr. Kumaraswamy.  Both the Opposition leaders dismissed the allegations. Mr. Shivakumar claimed that Mr. Yogeshwar had, in fact, come to meet him 15 days ago and expressed his willingness to join the Congress, but he had advised Mr. Yogeshwar to remain in the BJP. Mr. Kumaraswamy said that he was not interested in “adjustment politics” and was not attacking the government at this stage because it could affect its efforts to handle the COVID-19 situation. He claimed that both Mr. Yogeshwar and Mr. Shivakumar were trying to weaken the JD(S) in Ramanagaram. Mr. Yogeshwar had lost to Mr. Kumaraswamy in Channapatnain the 2018 Assembly polls. Later, he played a key role in Operation Kamala to bring down the Congress-JD(S) coalition government. Sworn in as MLC on Thursday, he is one of the ministerial aspirants anda Vokkaliga leader from Ramanagaram district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hdk-is-indirectly-supporting-bjp-government-yogeshwar/article32235721.ece
31 July 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Just want to get over with CET’||Amidst drama and tension, students took part in the Common Entrance Test (CET) 2020 at centres across the State on Thursday. Out of the 1.94 lakh students who registered, 1.47 lakh attempted biology and 1.73 lakh wrote the maths paper. Physics and chemistry will be held on Friday. The CET is the gateway to seats in engineering and agriculture colleges, among others. Those who had registered for CET were on tenterhooks till Wednesday evening when the Karnataka High Court gave the go-ahead for conducting the exams. In Bengaluru, students and authorities reported to test centres wearing masks and armed with hand sanitisers, while anxious parents waited outside. “I do not know why we had to put up with this last-minute tension. They are conducting the exam during the pandemic and, on top of that, there are these uncertainties,” said one anxious parent. Some students wore face shields and gloves as an added precautionary measure. “When I wrote the final second PU paper, we took similar precautions, but the number of cases were not so high then. Now, there are more than 50,000 COVID-19 cases in Bengaluru alone. I am very worried,” said a student. Parents, too, were worried. “When my daughter wrote her only pending second PU English paper in the third week of June, there were not more than 500 active cases in the city. Now, the cases have sky-rocketed,” said one parent, as he waited outside a centre at K.R. Puram. For the most part, students had mixed reactions to writing CET at a time when the pandemic showed no sign of easing in Bengaluru, but all wanted to “get it over with”. “Once the exam is over, I will be able to relax. We have been at home since March, but I could not stop thinking about the examination and the uncertainty. It was not a good experience,” said a student, echoing the views of many of her peers. Another student told The Hindu: “COVID-19 is here to stay, and it is better to just get done with the CET.” Anxiety levels were high as students have to attempt four core papers over two days. “There’s pandemic-related pressure over and above the normal exam pressure,” said another student.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/just-want-to-get-over-with-cet/article32235730.ece
31 July 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||High Court cautions govt. over handling COVID-19 situation||Expressing concern over the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in the State, the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday orally cautioned the State government that it may be constrained to observe that the “State’s official machinery has been broken down” resulting in the situation moving towards worst from being best earlier. The court termed as “like shedding crocodile tears” the manner in which the State government set up a team of doctors to inspect and supervise COVID-19 hospitals with a delay of 45 days after the apex court’s June 19 order to all the States and after the High Court cautioned it about non-constitution of the team. The court also cautioned that it may have to appoint an independent team of experts to inspect and supervise COVID-19 health facilities if the State government failed to take corrective steps to enforce the apex court’s order in its “true letter and spirit”. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice M.I. Arun, hearing PIL petitions on issues related to COVID-19 management, said it hopes that the government takes immediate steps to set up an expert team and takes all steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Bench noted that the team set up by the State government comprised of only doctors and no other experts are part of it despite the apex court’s direction. Though the government included an NGO in the Bengaluru city and district-level teams, the Bench pointed out that it did not name the NGO whose presence would have given valid inputs to the government to address issues on COVID-19 management. Also, the Bench orally pointed out that though the bureaucrats were working to contain the spread of COVID-19, there appears to be lapse at certain levels, particularly in the lower levels of monitoring. A few eminent persons, the Bench said, should be made part of the team of experts, who can report about the lapses and shortcomings directly to the State’s top executives such as the Chief Minister, who can then act on their advise. Death certificate Meanwhile, in response to a court’s query made during the last hearing, the State authorities clarified to the Bench that no stigma would be attached to the family of any person who has died either of COVID-19 or because of co-morbidities after contracting COVID-19 as the law does not permit mentioning the cause of death of any person in the death certificate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/high-court-cautions-govt-over-handling-covid-19-situation/article32235683.ece
31 July 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Students directed to produce COVID-19 negative certificate||A few engineering colleges in Bengaluru are allegedly asking final-year students to produce a COVID-19 negative test report before they can appear for the examination scheduled for August. Staff involved in conducting the exam have also reportedly been asked to produce a certificate. After receiving complaints from parents and students, Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) has issued directions to colleges to desist from asking for such certificates. “This does not make any sense. Colleges should refrain from doing so. If they continue to insist and ask students to provide the certificates, disciplinary action will be taken against them,” Vice-Chancellor Karisiddappa told The Hindu . He added that complaints have been received against two colleges in Soladevanahalli and Jalahalli. Final-year students, who received a circular asking them to get a medical certificate, are anxious and say the rule makes little sense. “Even if we undergo a test, it will be several days before we get our results. Even if we get a test done seven days before our exam, what happens if we contract the infection after we give our swab test?” asked one student. An associate professor at another college in the city said they have asked the management whether they should take an antigen test or an RT-PCR one. “The tests are expensive. This is a huge burden, as we have suffered salary cuts. We asked the college to bear the cost of the test, but the management has refused,” she said. Around 55,000 engineering students, who study in colleges affiliated to VTU, will appear for the final-year exam in the last week of August. Students have to appear for three papers; the viva for their projects will be conducted online. While appearing for the exam,they will have to wear masks and gloves. Colleges have been told to provide accommodation for students residing in paying guest accommodations or hostels during the course of the exam. Students who have tested positive for COVID-19 can appear forthe exam in separate rooms at their colleges. This move has not gone down well with many students, who have urged the university to have separate exam centres in every district where those with COVID-19 can sit for their papers. “This is a big risk for students. Our demand is to cancel the exam. Else, we need separate centres so that other students are not put at risk. They should also consult medical experts,” said Abhaya Diwakar, State treasurer, All-India Democratic Students Organisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/students-directed-to-produce-covid-19-negative-certificate/article32235726.ece

31 July 2020||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Expert says new education policy aims at addressing ‘educational divisions’||Member of the Draft Committee of the new National Education Policy (NEP) Professor T.V. (Tejaswi) Kattimani has said that the new education policy approved by the Union Cabinet will alleviate “educational divisions” in the existing system and help students pursue courses in various disciplines depending on their interest. In an interaction with media persons in Hubballi on Thursday, Prof. Kattimani, who is also former Vice-Chancellor of the Indira Gandhi National Tribal University, Amarkantak, said that the NEP would bring rural India comprising various skills of farming, pottery, animal husbandry, horticulture and others to the educational mainstream. Prof. Kattimani said that although 70 % of the people in the country reside in villages and 60 % are dependent on agriculture, the modern education system had neglected the rural education comprising skills and traditional knowledge. “Many are under the wrong perception that having white collar jobs is education. But the main objective of the new education policy is to make the rural India an important part of the texts and achieve compatibility in education and employment,” he said. Emphasising the need for setting up a system wherein trained scientists use traditional knowledge and time-tested methods to find advanced solutions to existing problems, Prof. Kattimani said that the NEP aimed at achieving this objective. Role of teachers Prof. Kattimani said that the failure of the Indian education system was because of teachers. He said that while elected representatives, bureaucrats and the general public too had contributed to the failure, the responsibility of teachers was more. He, however, said that it was teachers alone who could bring about an educational revolution in the country through their commitment and perseverance. He said that the NEP barred teachers from being used for non-educational activities thus helping them to focus on their core duties. The NEP also focussed on strengthening the government educational institutions while, at the same time, regulating private institutions. He said that he was against setting up of universities for agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry as the farmer who was engaged in all these activities never made a distinction between them. These universities should not end up sending graduates who would seek jobs but, instead, they should provide comprehensive education on all aspects of farming, he said. Stressing on the need for increasing budgetary allocation for education, he said that NEP had already made this recommendation and, also increasing allocation annually. “Without modifying and strengthening primary education, it is difficult to improve higher education. NEP aims at bringing in more cultural and social values into the education system,” he said. To a query, Prof. Kattimani said that Tamil Nadu and Punjab had become model States in the country as they had achieved success in providing higher education in native languages and there was a need for similar initiatives elsewhere. However, Prof. Kattimani declined to comment on why the draft policy was announced without facilitating a debate in Parliament.  Teachers alone can bring about an educational revolution through their commitment and perseverance Professor T.V.

31 July 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Cong. may go to court against amendment to land reforms Act’||Accusing the State government of succumbing to pressure from the real estate lobby and amending the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Thursday said the Congress was considering a proposal to move the courts against the “anti-farmer” amendment. Participating in an interaction programme with journalists in Mysuru, he said the aimof the amendment to the Act by dropping Section 80 was to benefit non-agriculturists, who have purchased large tracts of agricultural lands in and around Bengaluru, Mysuru, and other parts of the State and are facing court cases. As part of the amendment, which was effected through a “hurriedly” issued ordinance, Section 63 and 79 A, B and C of the Act, which deal with the ceiling on ownership, among other things, too have been dropped. Mr. Siddaramaiah said 13,814 cases were pending before various courts in the State, reportedly involving 1.7 lakh acres of land. A majority of the cases pertained to Bengaluru Rural, where 1,800 cases were pending, followed by Bengaluru Urban and Mysuru, where 1,080 and 990 cases were pending, respectively. He estimated that as much as 41,000 acres of land was involved in litigation just in Bengaluru Rural and Urban areas. Claiming that an acre of agricultural land would cost anywhere between Rs. 2 crore and Rs. 10 crore, depending on the distance from Bengaluru, he sought to know the purpose behind the government’s decision. “What was the necessity? There must be a specific reason [for the move]. Did the people of the State demand it? If you issue an ordinance when the Assembly is not in session, there should be an emergency. What was the emergency?” he asked, before accusing the government of amending the piece of legislation with “mala fide” intentions as crores of rupees was involved in the matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cong-may-go-to-court-against-amendment-to-land-reforms-act/article32235716.ece

31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Digging of tunnel for Pink Line of Namma Metro begins||After clearing several hurdles over the years, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has commissioned tunnel work on the Pink Line under Phase II of Namma Metro. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Thursday inaugurated the work at the proposed Cantonment underground metro station. As the CM pressed a green button, huge cutters of the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) named Urja started drilling. The machine will be tunnelling a distance of 850 metres from Cantonment to Shivajinagar. Urja is around 102 metres long, and costs Rs. 70 crore. Another TBM, christened Vindhya, will be commissioned shortly after Urja makes some headway, said a BMRCL official. Under Phase II, BMRCL is building a tunnel network for the 13.9 km underground line from Jayanagar Fire Station to Nagawara. The alignment has 12 underground stations and 10.37 km of twin tunnels. “To expedite the project, work has been taken up in four packages,” said the Chief Minister. The machines were procured from China, and reached the port in Chennai from where they were transported to Bengaluru in March. BMRCL will deploy nine TBMs, of which four will carry out work initially. The other two TBMs are named Avani and Lavi, and will be deployed for the underground network between Shivajinagar and Vellara junction. “Considering the geographical condition of the city, the machine will drill a distance of 2.5 metres per day. Expected geology in this tunnel section is about 250 metres of hard rock, 350 metres of mixed ground condition and about 225 metres of soil,” said a senior BMRCL official, adding that if all goes as planned, work on drilling 850 metres will be completed in nine months. Bengaluru is witnessing tunnel works after a gap of almost four years. Under Phase I, to build a tunnel network for a distance of 8.8 km, the BMRCL had started work in May 2011, which continued till September 2016. BMRCL had faced tough challenges in building the tunnel network due to hard rock.

Many students, who had returned to the campus in June, want the institute to issue directions asking students to stop returning to the hostel and the campus so that the number of cases can be curtailed. Health Centre The Health Centre, which was closed on Wednesday, has now been re-opened. “We want the institute to improve their contact tracing methods so that primary and secondary contacts are quickly quarantined,” said one student. New director Professor Govindan Rangarajan is scheduled to assume office as IISc. director on August 1 following the superannuation of the incumbent Anurag Kumar.

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has appealed to citizens to stay indoors on Varamahalakshmi and not to visit temples. While the State government has issued detailed guidelines, including a ban on Eidgah prayers for Bakr Eid on July 31-August 1, it is yet to take a call on the modalities for celebration of Ganesha festival on August 22 and observing Muharram on August 29. Guidelines issued by A.B. Ibrahim, secretary, Minority Welfare, Haj and Wakf, ban mass prayers in Eidgah maidans and other public places. Prayers can be offered only in masjids before 8 a.m. with not more than 50 people, maintaining social distancing and taking all precautions. Those wanting to take part in the prayers should mandatorily bring their own prayer mats. The customary hug to wish each other will not be possible this year. Slaughter of animals has been banned at all public places and will be allowed only in slaughter-houses. Unlike before, BBMP has restricted the sale of sheep to certain designated venues, all on the outskirts of the city. “While Muharram is also a public event, it does not lead to large crowds, like Bakr Eid, especially in urban areas. We are working on Muharram-specific guidelines, which will be issued in the coming weeks,” Mr. Ibrahim said. The State government is yet to take a call on Ganesha festivities. “The Ministry of Home Affairs is expected to come out with guidelines for pandals across the country. We are waiting for that,” said a senior government functionary. While several experts have reportedly advised the State government to completely ban public celebration of the festival this year, the issue has become a politically sensitive matter for the ruling BJP, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-to-issue-guidelines-for-ganesha-festival/article32235673.ece

One of the students who wrote the exam at SDM Ayurveda College in Hassan told The Hindu that he had done well in the exam and appreciated the facilities at the centre. “It has been a different experience for me. I feel bad that while my friends who wrote the test got to go home, I have to stay put here for three more days,” he said. CET duty Mohammed Salman, administrative medical officer of Gorur PHC, who is one of the invigilators at the COVID Care Centre, said: “One student, who had scored very well in the PU exam, was worried before the CET started. It was quite natural because he had to make last-minute preparations away from home. We motivated him to write the exam. By evening, he was fine,” he said. Dr. Salman said it was a difficult task for the doctors as they had to remain in PPE suits for long hours. Social distancing Medical officer K. Akash, who was also on CET duty, said the students were seated maintaining six feet distance between them. “The OMR sheets they answered were kept in a sterile pack, which was again placed in a metal box and sealed,” he said. In Bengaluru, Deputy Chief Minister and Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan visited the COVID Care Centre at GKVK, which is serving as a CET centre, wearing PPE kit. He spoke to the candidates present there. Special arrangements were made for transport and food of COVID-19 positive students who wrote the test.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/57-students-write-exam-at-covid-care-centres/article32235728.ece

Krishna Pillai, founder leader of the Communist movement in Kerala. District and Sessions Judge A. Badharudeen absolved Latheesh B. Chandran, P. Sabu, P. Deepumon, C.R. Rajesh and M. Pramod, all CPI(M) activists, of the charges as the prosecution failed to prove their involvement. The hut at Kannarkatu in Alappuzha where Krishna Pillai breathed his last following a snakebite on August 19, 1948, while in hiding, was set ablaze in the early hours of October 31, 2013. The miscreants had also defaced Krishna Pillai’s bust erected in the courtyard. The incident led to a war of words between leaders of the Left and Congress. The case was initially investigated by the local police but later handed over to the Crime Branch. The prosecution case was that the factional feud in the CPI(M) had led to the attack on the memorial. The CPI(M) had ousted Chandran, a former personnel staff of former Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan; Sabu, former secretary, CPI(M) Kannarkatu local committee; Deepumon, Rajesh and Pramod from the party after being named accused in the case. ‘Book real culprits’ Responding to the verdict, Chandran and Sabu said that they had been framed in the case by the then Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala and the Crime Branch. They demanded that the real culprits in the case be booked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/accused-in-krishna-pillai-memorial-attack-acquitted/article32236033.ece

The catchment area of the dam recorded 72 mm rainfall on Thursday and 5.4 mm the previous day. An official at the Dam Monitoring and Research Station, Vazhathoppe, said the water level in the dam was 2,334 ft on Thursday, an increase of below one ft from the previous day. The power generation at the Moolamattom powerhouse was at a low of 2.21 mu. There was a shortfall of nearly 40% in southwest monsoon in the district and in the high ranges, where most of the dams are located, it was below average. The Mullaperiyar dam, upstream of the Idukki dam, also recorded poor rainfall. In both Idukki and Mullaperiyar dams, the water level was below the normal level recorded at the end of July. As on Thursday, the water level was 114 ft in the Mullaperiyar dam, where the maximum storage level is 142 ft. The Central Water Commission has fixed a new rule curve level for dams in the wake of the 2018 floods . The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) monitors the dams to keep the water level below the new rule curve level. The level was 2,380.58 ft at the Idukki dam as on Thursday. A senior KSEB official said as the water level in all hydroelectric dams was way below the new rule curve level, there was no possibility of opening the dams in the present situation. Electricity Minister M.M. Mani The Hindu that the average reservoir level of State dams was below 30%. “There is a chance of a crisis on the power front if rainfall is deficient. However, it can be compensated as there is availability of power from outside sources. With the realisation of the Udumalpet-Madakkathara double circuit lines, it is now possible to avail enough power as per the State demand,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/erratic-rain-may-spell-crisis-on-power-front/article32236067.ece

31 July 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Flooding in Kochi: High Court asks Collector, corpn. to explain||The Kerala High Court on Thursday directed the District Collector and the Kochi Corporation Secretary to file independent reports explaining as to why a large-scale inundation took place during the heavy rain on July 29 in the city, especially at Panampilly Nagar, Stadium Link Road, Kaloor, and M.G. Road. Justice Devan Ramachandran issued the directive after taking up a pending case on flooding in the city. The court observed that on every occasion when the case had come up for hearing, the district administration and the Kochi Corporation had maintained that effective and necessary steps had been taken to tackle inundation in the city. However, experience proved otherwise, and, therefore, the court had reason to suspect that something was wrong somewhere. P&T Colony The court also directed the government pleader to inform it of the fate of the Government Order on shifting residents of P&T Colony to the land in Rameswaram village owned by the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) by including it in the Life Mission Project. “It was brought to the notice of the court that though the order was issued in 2018, nothing concrete had been done so far,” the court said. The court pointed out that the inundation of the colony bared the pathetic state of its residents. “Not merely were they bombarded with water, but they were under fear of COVID-19 spread,” it observed. The district administration submitted that waterlogging occurred because of the faulty gradient of the Mullassery canal bed, constructed by the corporation years ago. The flow of water to the Perandoor canal was now totally obstructed on account of the railway line as well. News reports The court pointed out that news reports in 2018 had quoted the principal adviser to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) as saying that unless the slope of the Mullassery canal from Vivekananda Road area was altered towards the west, waterlogging could never be solved, as water from the canal could not be allowed to flow into the Perandoor canal. The irony was that no steps had been taken by any authority for the last two years, though under Operation Breakthrough, the district administration had described it as a necessary work, the court observed. The executive engineer attached to Operation Breakthrough had also earlier conceded before the court that the rectification work should be done, and that it could be carried out only after the monsoon. Rectifying the slope of the Mullassery canal will have to be done on a war footing. If the corporation is not prepared to carry out the work, the District Collector could get it done by invoking the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, the court said. The report of the Collector and the corporation should mention the proposals for the work, the court ordered. The case was posted to August 4 for further hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/flooding-in-kochi-high-court-asks-collector-corpn-to-explain/article32236003.ece
31 July 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Kochi breathes easy as rain subsides for the day||Kochi breathed easy as rain subsided on Thursday after about 200 mm of downpour over a period of 20 hours from Tuesday night and high tide inundated several stretches of the city’s arterial roads, flooded homes in low-lying areas and forced the administration to shift 55 families to a relief camp. Shopkeepers at Panampilly Nagar, which saw one of the worst flooding, were seen cleaning their shops and premises on Thursday morning. Ponneth South Road Residents’ Association president P.V. Shivadasan said that about a kilometre of the road was flooded during the rain on Wednesday and said that a comprehensive plan was needed to address the recurring floods. Baji Chandran, executive engineer, Irrigation Department, overseeing the implementation of Operation Breakthrough, said that the heavy downpour and 80-cm high tide against the normal level of 40 cm could not be effectively handled by the drainage system. Floodwaters started receding in most of the areas after 12.45 p.m. on Wednesday against a situation in which most part of the city remained flooded last year for about 48 hours, he said, recalling the October 2019 inundation of several places in the city. He also said that people living along the TP Canal had to be shifted as the canal was not fully opened out for water to drain. He also said that places like Koithara saw floodwaters receding after noon on Wednesday. Mr. Chandran said that Operation Breakthrough covered only Kochi Corporation areas and not areas under Maradu and Thripunithura civic administrations. Public Works Standing Committee Chairman of the Kochi Corporation P.M. Harris said that all the agencies had to work together, take each other into confidence and execute a master plan to solve the problem of Kochi city’s flooding. Corpn. slammed Meanwhile, the district unit of the CPI(M) blamed the ruling coalition in the Corporation for its failure to save Kochi from another round of flooding. The city administration was steeped in corruption and inefficiency, said a statement issued by the party unit here on Thursday. If Kochi had some relief from flooding, it was because of Operation Breakthrough under the initiative of the State government, introduced in October last year, the statement said. The party unit also pointed out that the Corporation authorities had come under censure from the High Court for its failures. The key reason for the flooding of city areas on Wednesday was the failure of the Corporation to desilt the Thevara-Perandoor canal, which it had taken upon itself, the statement added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kochi-breathes-easy-as-rain-subsides-for-the-day/article32236005.ece

But beating all odds she stepped out of the COVID-19 isolation ward after just 10 days, much to the delight of her doctors at Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Kollam. The oldest COVID-19 survivor in the State, her recovery was one momentous occasion for the hospital after the discharge of little Insaf, who tested positive when he was only three days old. ‘Very positive’ Asma Beevi had tested positive on June 20 and by then nine members of her family had contracted the virus. “She was symptomatic and had hypertension whichis a risk factor. We had constituted a special team for her treatment and an additional monitoring system was in place. She was very positive and never developed any serious issues during the treatment. We never had to shift her to the ICU and her recovery has brought some much-needed cheer,” says Shiril Ashraf M.A., Resident Medical Officer, GMC. According to her family, the great-grandmother had no serious ailments apart from some age-related difficulty in walking. “We were more worried at the prospect of leaving her alone at the hospital as we were sent to different places. Though several members of the family, including infants, tested positive, she was our major concern. But she seemed very confident and said her generation had seen worst contagions like smallpox,” says her grandson Shameer. Only five members of the family, including Shameer, have been discharged, but Asma Beevi’s recovery has instilled confidence in others. At the other end Insaf’s mother Ayisha had tested positive two days after an emergency C-section on May 21. He tested positive the next day and both the mother and baby had to spend over a fortnight at the MCH. Baby Insaf first tested negative and it took several days for Ayisha to recover and complete her quarantine before she reunited with her son. “We had another team headed by a paediatrician for the newborn. Since patients in both extremes of age are vulnerable, special critical care teams are deployed for them,” says Dr. Ashraf.  Kollam MCH nursed back to health two COVID-19 patients, a 105-year-old and a 3-day-old.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/duo-prove-that-age-is-no-bar-in-beating-the-virus/article32236128.ece

There are 541 active cases in Kottayam. The district also recorded 564 recoveries so far. Officials said the clusters in Kottayam, except Ettumanur, were on the declining path. While Ettumanur reported 15 cases, Changanassery reported just five cases. Taking a serious note of the situation, Ettumanur municipal authorities are planning to conduct 100 antigen tests there. Though the explosion of cases in and around Changanassery has largely subsided, authorities are embarking on a plan to implement cluster containment strategies for adjacent villages. Authorities have intensified monitoring of COVID-19 protocol at the taluk level by deploying a joint team of revenue, police, and LSGD officials. Cases were registered against 59 persons for violating the guidelines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/29-test-positive-in-kottayam/article32236130.ece
31 July 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Community volunteers gear up to tackle rain-related disasters||Community Rescue Volunteers trained by the Fire and Rescue Services personnel are keeping vigil in the rural areas of Kozhikode in the wake of fresh rough weather alerts from the Meteorological Department and the recent episodes of minor landslips and flash floods. Though some families living in the vulnerable areas of Kuttiyadi and Kavilumpara have been shifted to safer locations, the process is likely to be continued with the support of the volunteers and the local administrators concerned. The sudden rise in water level continues to be a concern for several families living close to the Iruvazhinji river. Four drowning incidents have been reported from various locations this monsoon. The volunteers in such areas have been asked to remain alert. Heavy rain and instances of landslips are worrying residents living near large-scale quarrying areas. Action councils in those areas have appealed to the local administrators to impose a permanent ban on such quarrying sites. At present, all four taluks of Kozhikode, Koyilandy, Vadakara and Thamarassery have their own volunteer force apart from the Fire and Rescue Services units to deal with natural calamities. Revenue officials coordinating the activities of volunteers are in touch with grama panchayat authorities to expand their operations to more vulnerable areas. In Kozhikode’s Mukkom village, a volunteer squad is fully operational now with a wide network of trained persons to swing into action during emergency situations. Their service during the last episodes of floods and landslips in upland areas was praiseworthy and it had prompted many local bodies to promote such local units to the level of first respondents to handle emergency situations in remote villages. Village officials said the active involvement of volunteers would be crucial in managing the impact of natural calamities in interior areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/community-volunteers-gear-up-to-tackle-rain-related-disasters/article32235997.ece

Fifty-seven people were cured of the infection and 42 new cases were reported on the day. A death was reported from the Government Medical College Hospital. The deceased is a 77-year-old native of Kozhikode. According to a release, 34 of the new cases were through local transmission and the source of six others was not known. The number of active cases went up to 704. 12 quarantined at MCH Meanwhile, 12 more health workers attached to the medical college hospital went in quarantine. The tertiary cancer centre there has been partially closed after some staff members there tested positive for the virus recently. An all-party meet held at the Kozhikode Corporation on Thursday decided to have micro-containment zones in the city instead of closing down entire wards for preventive steps. Mobile testing units would be set up to test people who are not in containment zones and not on the contact list of the infected population. In view of the possibility of a large number of migrant labourers reaching the Beypore fishing harbour, boat owners were asked to submit a list of their crew members to the Fisheries Department. The labourers should undergo 14-day quarantine and submit themselves for tests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/57-recoveries-42-new-cases-in-kozhikode/article32235996.ece

There will be no Id Gahs and mass Id prayers in major mosques. Animal slaughter, a significant component of Bakrid, will be done in a minimal way as there are restrictions. However, Id prayers will be held in mosques which have been functioning with COVID-19 restrictions. More than 100 persons will not be allowed in any such mosques. Mosques in containment zones will remain closed. Animal sacrifice will take place in a restricted manner. The government said more than five persons should not assemble for sacrifice. Sacrifices in containment zones have been banned. But the meat of animals slaughtered outside the zone can be distributed within. Markets in Malabar witnessed rush on Thursday evening as last-minute buyers thronged vegetable and meat shops. Although shops were allowed to function until 8 p.m. in Malappuram district in view of Bakrid, many continued their business beyond that. As most people remained at home and many expatriates having returned home because of the pandemic threat, Muslim homes turned more vibrant on the eve of Bakrid.

The bird atlas project is being carried out by Pathanamthitta Birders, an association of birdwatchers in central Travancore. Talking to The Hindu , Hari Mavelikara, coordinator of the District Bird Atlas Project, said the bird count in the district began in 2015 and would be completed this year itself. He said the survey was being carried out in two seasons, monsoon and summer, every year. The ongoing monsoon bird survey that began on July 16 would end on September 15. “Kerala is the first State in the country to conduct a bird atlas and the survey that began in 2015 will come to a close in September,” he said. Anish Sasidevan, Jiji Sam, Aju K. Raju, Siyad Karim, Robin C. Koshy, Libin Abraham, Siju Joseph, Nisanth Raveendran, Eby Kuryan, Sajin Seethi, Shameena, Harithakrishnan, Hari Kumar Mannar, Jayakrishnan, Biju P.B., Venu G., Aswin Nisanth, Tijin, and Tony are part of the survey team headed by Mr Hari. Fewer waterbirds Mr. Hari said the team had conducted a two-day Asian Water Bird Census too in seven wetlands in the district in January. The survey registered a fall in the number of waterbirds in the district, compared to the survey results of 2019, he said. The census was aimed at obtaining information on an annual basis of the waterbird population in wetlands in the region during the non-breeding period of most species (January). The birds spotted by the Pathanamthitta Birders over the past four years included flame-throated bulbul, Malabar trogon, crested serpent eagle, brown fish owl, orange-headed thrush, spot-billed duck, little ringed plover, common greenshack, painted stork, Indian Pitta (forest bird), black-shouldered kite, grey heron, and oriental darter, Mr. Hari said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/an-avian-census-in-pathanamthitta/article32236072.ece

The woman, Omana Surendran from Kavumpady in Manimala, reportedly slipped and fell into the flooded river early Thursday. A passer-by found the woman clinging to a bunch of bamboo plants and drifting along the swollen river near the railway over-bridge at Kuttoor around 9.45 a.m. He passed on the information to his friends at Kuttoor junction, about a kilometre downstream. In the next 20 minutes, villages blocked the bamboo cluster at Thondara bridge in Kuttoor and rescued the woman. By then, she had covered a distance of around 40 km from Manimala to Kuttoor. She was conscious and gave her son’s telephone number to the local people. The villagers rushed her to the Thiruvalla taluk hospital and her son, Rajesh, reached there by noon. She said she accidentally fell in the river in the morning and managed to stay afloat by holding on to the bamboo plants. Her son took her to the Government Medical College Hospital in Kottayam. Her condition is stated to be stable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/staying-afloat-in-gushing-manimala-for-40-km/article32236132.ece

This is in view of the restrictions on entry of pilgrims to the hillock in view of COVID-19. Rajendra Prasad, Devaswom executive officer, said the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) decided to restrict the entry of people to Sabarimala as the head priests (Melsanthi) of the Ayyappa temple and the adjoining Malikappuram Devi temple were not supposed to move out of the pilgrim centre during their one-year tenure there. TDB president N.Vasu said Sabarimala would remain inaccessible to pilgrims for some more time The Ayyappa temple will be opened at 5 p.m. on August 8 for the annual Niraputhari to be observed on August 9.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told media persons here that other patients would be shifted to other government hospitals, including the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH) here. However, patients in Ward 9 that accommodated destitute patients and those suffering from mental illness would not be shifted. They would continue to receive treatment in the hospital adhering to safety guidelines. The hospital has 769 beds, including 25 beds in the intensive care unit (ICU). Doctors’ demand Notably, the announcement comes on a day when a doctors’ meeting at the hospital appealed to the government to continue to treat non-COVID-19 patients also at the GH. Pointing out that the hospital lagged only behind the MCH in terms of specialty and super-specialty facilities among the public health institutions in the district, the meeting had observed that assigning the hospital for COVID-19 treatment alone would render several services there unutilised. Services These included the facilities of the ICU; specialty services in the General Medicine department; and facilities, including cath lab, echocardiogram, acute and peritoneal dialysis, renal biopsy, endoscopy and malignance laparoscopic procedure of super-specialty departments of Neurology, Urology, Gastroenterology, Nephrology and Cardiology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/gh-to-be-made-exclusive-covid-19-treatment-centre/article32236076.ece
31 July 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||What went wrong in containing disease spread in State||On January 30 afternoon when Health Minister K.K. Shylaja made a television appearance to announce that the first novel coronavirus infection in Indian had been confirmed in a medical student from Wuhan, none could have imagined it was just the beginning of a long innings with a virus hitherto unknown. Though a sense of panic had gripped the State then, it could contain the first three cases from spreading to even the immediate family members. The sense of elation was short-lived when on March 8 a three-member family from Italy tested positive for COVID-19 in Pathanamthitta. Cases began climbing in the State as people began returning home from abroad. On March 24, when the 21-day nationwide lockdown was announced, Kerala had 109 cases. On May 8, when expatriates were beginning to return to Kerala in large numbers, the number of active cases was just 16. The cumulative number was over 500. Rapid change The scenario changed rapidly with imported cases of infection. The picture changed by May end when the proportion of locally acquired infections began to rise, many of which had no epidemiological link. While the government continued in denial about silent disease transmission happening in the community, the outbreak in the State’s coastal belt three weeks ago took the entire health administration by surprise. With the coastal belt becoming transmission zones, the government admitted community transmission at least in some places. Kerala’s initial response to the COVID-19 outbreak was pre-emptive and focussed. The initial strategy of aggressively isolating, quarantining, and contact tracing worked very well. However, in the next phase, the focus should have been on sharpening surveillance strategies to detect community transmission rather than just containment. Early hospital-based surveillance, surveillance of viral pneumonia, and SARI (severe acute respiratory infection) cases in a decentralised manner should have been initiated. Focus Public health experts believe that an early acknowledgement of community transmission followed by focussed surveillance studies and testing in areas such as markets would have made the public more aware of the importance of safety precautions and helped the State limit the spread of the infection in a much better manner. The State should have focussed better on having solid mitigation plans on ground but when the surge in cases came, the health system found itself buckling under the pressure. The global experience has shown the importance of amping up critical care capacity. Yet, the private sector was not taken into confidence till recently. Six months hence, the State is facing a scenario when there could be at least 75,000 patients filling the hospitals at a time in August-September. The government is now trying to enhance the health system capacity and keep the transmission down. It is trying to draw on its strengths at the grassroots so that the capacity management is a decentralised affair.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/what-went-wrong-in-containing-disease-spread-in-state/article32236026.ece
31 July 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Fishing activity to resume from Aug. 5||Fishing activity along Kerala shores will be allowed to resume from August 5 subject to stringent conditions, given the worsened COVID-19 scenario. The decision was taken at a videoconference convened by Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma on Thursday as the 52-day annual monsoon trawling ban is ending on July 31 midnight. Boats from containment zones also will be allowed to operate. For the time being, however, boats and crew from other States will not be allowed to enter Kerala harbours/fish landing centres or participate in fisheries-related activities in view of the COVID-19 situation. Formal orders in this regard are expected to be out on Friday. COVID-19 protocol Fishermen from the State who venture out to sea from August 5 must adhere to stringent disease containment protocols, given the alarming extent of the spread of COVID-19 in the coastal areas. Boats will be allowed out to sea on alternate days under an odd-even scheme based on their registration numbers. They will not be allowed to dock at other harbours/landing centres. Physical-distancing norms and use of sanitiser and face masks will be strictly enforced. The crew strength in the boats will be regulated. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that harbour management societies and people's committees would determine the price of fish in harbours and landing centres respectively. Transportation curbs Transportation of the catch from the coastal areas, especially those in the COVID-19 containment zones, would be strictly regulated. Fish unloaded in the landing centres within containment zones cannot be sold outside the zones. The ban on the auctioning of catch will continue. From bigger harbours, the catch will be transported elsewhere in disinfected trucks under the supervision of Matsyafed. Trade unions in the fisheries sector and representatives of boat owners attended the meeting. The annual trawling ban had come into effect on the midnight of June 9.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fishing-activity-to-resume-from-aug-5/article32236038.ece

Seventy people, including nine health workers, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the day. Sixty persons contracted the infection through local transmission. The source of infection was unknown in three cases. With 220 people recovering from the illness, the number of people being treated for the infection in the district stood at 2,872. A total of 23 COVID-19 first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) functioned in the district. While 1,612 asymptomatic people are being treated in these facilities, there are 888 vacant beds. Among those who were diagnosed with the disease on the day is a driver in the NRI cell of the Kerala Police headquarters who is a native of Vellarada. Four more employees of the Kinfra International Apparel Park also tested positive for the infection. Two more deaths Two more COVID-19 related deaths were reported in the district. The deceased were a 72-year-old man from Nedumangad who was admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital and a 52-year-old female patient from Poovachal. The patients, who died on Thursday, had been battling other ailments. The man was a cancer patient while the woman was a diabetic. The two deaths have not been added to the official tally of COVID-19 death toll. Meanwhile, the district administration issued orders removing Muttada, Kadakampally, Karamana and Kowdiar wards of Thiruvananthapuram Corporation and Venjaramoodu in Nellanad grama panchayat from the list of containment wards. The decision was taken on the basis of an assessment that the spread of the disease has been checked to a large extent in these areas. Meanwhile, containment zones have been declared in Thattathumala, Parandakuzhi and Sheddilkada wards of Pazhayakunnumel panchayat, Mullaravila ward of Neyyatinkara municipality and all wards of Kallikkad panchayat. Aid to fishers The city Corporation is seeking public support to supply kits containing essential commodities to fishermen families in the critical containment zones. The civic body is planning to provide kits containing items worth Rs. 1,000 to each family, Mayor K. Sreekumar said on Thursday. Given the COVID-19 scenario, the Corporation would launch a web portal, help.covid19tvm.com, to facilitate online contributions from the public to finance the initiative.

All its long-distance services that remained off the road since the pandemic-induced lockdown began on March 25 will be available for commuters from Saturday.  Counter move The move comes in the wake of the withdrawal of night curfew as per the Unlock 3 norms and to counter the decision of private bus operators not to operate services from August 1 in support of their demands. The private bus operators are demanding steps like waiver of road tax and diesel at subsidised rate to save the industry that is battling poor patronage. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Thursday that inter-district services would have to follow the COVID protocol. However, the government had decided not to take the risk of resuming bus services to Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in view of the increase in COVID-19 cases.  A KSRTC official said  the buses would neither halt in containment zones or operate from such zones. He said 30 of its 92 depots were in containment zones. “Commuters will be allowed as per the seating capacity and will not be allowed to stand. Moreover, face mask is mandatory to travel in buses. The number of long-distance services will depend on the patronage,” he said. In May, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs has given the authority to the State to decide on intrastate and interstate movement of passenger vehicles and buses after securing the approval of the States concerned during the extended lockdown. However, the government allowed the KSRTC and private buses on shorter routes within the districts.

Steps have been launched to facilitate the safe evacuation of people to relief camps in accordance with the COVID-19 protocol if the rainfall intensifies, he said here on Thursday. If the low pressure forms and intensifies into a depression, Kerala is likely to experience heavy rainfall. e India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) are closely monitoring the developments, he said. Torrential rain on Wednesday had caused waterlogging and damage in Kottayam, Vaikom, Kumarakom, Ernakulam, Cherthala, Kannur, and Vellanikara, he said. (According to the IMD, Cherthala received 19 cm of rainfall, Ernakulam South 18 cm, Vellanikkara 15 cm. Kochi airport, and Aluva and Piravom 14 cm each on Wednesday.) Orange alert Parts of the State can expect heavy rainfall on Friday also, the IMD said. Orange alert has been issued for Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, and Idukki.

Railways were hoping to remove the debris that had fallen along the 15-metre track and restore traffic by Thursday afternoon. But, the limited working space in the landslip area, poor road connectivity to move the machines and the 15-m high cutting from where the earth caved in hampered the restoration works. As it is a single lane and the landslip occurred near the approach to the tunnel, the debris is being removed using wagon to the opposite side and this is a time-consuming process. “Work is in full swing and the rail traffic is expected to be restored by Friday,” a top railway official said. Railways would take immediate measures to prevent further landslip by flattening the 15-metre cutting by acquiring land, he said. Train services via Kottayam had been diverted via Kayamkulam Junction-Alappuzha-Ernakulam Junction. Diverted On Thursday, Thiruvananthapuram Central-Ernakulam Venad Special Express (06302), Kannur-Thiruvananthapuram Central Janshatabdi Special (02081), Ernakulam-Thiruvanantha puram Central Venad Special Express (06301) and Thiruvananthapuram Central-Kannur Janshatabdi Special (02082) conducted service via Alappuzha.

31 July 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||State’s COVID-19 plans fail: Oppn.||The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition has accused the government of having forsaken COVID-19 afflicted persons and leaving them in the lurch with scarce State support in the time of the extreme crisis. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, who chaired a meeting of the coalition via videoconference on Thursday, said the State’s three-tier plan to treat COVID-19 patients had collapsed at the very start. The administration had deserted the people and left them to fend for themselves. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had claimed in March that the government had readied 2.5 lakh beds to quarantine expatriates. However, after the first few chartered flights arrived, the government retracted the mandate for compulsory institutional quarantine. He alleged that the government lied about ventilator and hospital bed capacity. It spurned the suggestion of experts to rope in the private health sector as early as April.  ‘The last straw’ A recent order by the Chief Secretary that COVID-19-afflicted persons should confine themselves at home was the last straw, he said adding the order did not mention whether doctors would make house calls or health workers monitor the status of patients. Instead, the government announced a slew of hefty fines for various violations of the health protocol such as failure to wear masks. “The government is treating a public health hazard as a law and order problem,” he said. He said Kerala had the lowest level of testing per thousand of the population. The government had repeatedly fudged health data to bolster its false claim that the disease was under control and at a manageable level. Experts had pointed out large-scale underreporting of cases. The government had repeatedly denied community transmission even as large community clusters erupted across the State. The stasis in government indicated a dismal failure in leadership on the part of Mr. Vijayan. The Chief Minister had no plan to reopen the economy safely. He should make cash available, a minimum Rs. 5,000, to daily wage earners at least now. The UDF would organise Statewide protests without breaking physical-distancing rules on August 3 and August 10 in 22,000 local body wards to press for the resignation of Mr. Vijayan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/states-covid-19-plans-fail-oppn/article32236029.ece
31 July 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Extremist link of hawala network under lens||At least three Central agencies are reportedly probing whether extremist elements extorted protection money from a Hyderabad-based hawala network suspected of having financed the smuggling of gold into the country from Dubai in air cargo consignments addressed to the consulate of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) here. Senior Customs investigators said they believed the money raised in Kerala to seed the smuggling runs was sent to the Dubai end of the international racket via the informal hawala banking system headquartered in Hyderabad. The accused used the underground money transfer business to dodge banking regulators. The operators at the Dubai end used the funds to purchase gold and convert the bullion into concealable form in cargo shipments addressed to the consulate. The smugglers used the same channel to plough back the profits into the pockets of their handlers in the Gulf. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is conducting a parallel probe into the racket, is reportedly inquiring whether the protection money paid by the hawala operators had gone to plot or finance domestic terrorism or fuel radical activity. Wealth case The Enforcement Directorate, the third agency involved in the case, is looking at the money laundering and illegal amassment of wealth angles of the case. Customs enforcers said the accused had smuggled at least 170 kg of contraband gold in 21 air cargo consignments send from Dubai to the UAE consulate here since July last. They also conducted two dry runs to gain an understanding of how Customs inspectors at the air cargo complex at the international airport here dealt with cargo sent to the mission from the UAE. The Customs reportedly learnt that the UAE government had taken a grave view of the matter. UAE authorities had reportedly questioned at least one consulate official suspected of having enabled the smuggling operation by raising receipted invoices to regularly ship everyday items and bathroom fittings to the diplomatic mission here. The official, who left the country for the UAE, had denied any wrongdoing and said the accused had faked his signature and letters of authorisation. A senior Customs official said the UAE government was likely to send the testimony of the consulate official to investigators here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/extremist-link-of-hawala-network-under-lens/article32236034.ece

31 July 2020||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Lucky escape for two youth as car gets washed away near Gooty||Two youth proceeding from Kadapa to Bijapur in Karnataka got washed away at a culvert at Gandhi Nagar near Gooty in Anantapur district on Thursday but had a miraculous escape as the water flow was shallow after 100 metres. Within two hours of the incident, a local fisherman, who had laid his net in the stream, also got washed away while trying to retrieve the catch. The villagers went to his rescue and brought him to safety. A little while later a Karnataka Road Transport Corporation bus stopped in the middle of the stream and did not start. People in the bus raised an alarm and none dared to get out of the bus as there was heavy water current. They feared the bus would get washed away and called out for help. Local people dragged the bus out of the stream with a rope. Police personnel temporarily stopped movement of people on this stretch between Gooty and Guntakal. Identified as Rakesh and Yousuf in their 30s, they were going behind an RTC bus between Gooty and Guntakal at 8.40 a.m. when their car came to the middle of the stream. With water flowing at great speed, the car floated and got washed away to about 100 metres, but at that place it was shallow and it got stuck. The vehicle did not get submerged and the duo made their way out of the vehicle and waited for the local people to reach the spot.  With all the tanks in Guntakal and Gooty mandals getting filled in recent rains, there has been an overflow for the past one week. Though there was not much rain on Wednesday in Gooty (24 mm) and Guntakal (0.9 mm) mandals, the Hundri Neeva Sujala Sravanthi water was released into the tanks during summer and a majority of the tanks were full. With heavy rains early in the monsoon, all tanks were overflowing. Incomplete culvert This stretch of the NH 67 has been posing a problem with the culvert portion yet to be completed by the contractor. The railings of the causeway-cum-culvert were also broken at the spot where the car stopped giving scope for the vehicle to float and carried away in the water flow. Traffic gets disrupted whenever there is rain either in Karnataka or Kurnool.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/lucky-escape-for-two-youth-as-car-gets-washed-away-near-gooty/article32236185.ece

31 July 2020||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tobacco growers favour cut in rabi crop size by 20%||Ahead of the Tobacco Board meeting on August 5 to finalise the crop size for 2020-21 season, farmers in the traditional tobacco growing areas in Prakasam and Nellore districts on Thursday urged it to cut the crop size by 20% for them to take advantage of the demand-supply situation. The lockdown-hit farmers wanted the crop regulator to take into account the quantity of tobacco purchased by Markfed while fixing the crop size for the coming rabi season. Market intervention The outbreak of coronavirus had adversely affected the quality of leaf in the form discolouration and weight loss. But for Markfed’s entry into the auction platforms, they would have incurred heavy loss of up to Rs. 3 lakh per barn, they said after taking stock of the situation in the 12 auction platforms. The intervention by Markfed had created demand for low grade varieties hitherto rejected by the traders. YSRCP farmers’ wing Prakasam district president Mareddy Subba Reddy said, “While directing the Markfed to intervene during the next cropping season as well, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy wanted the growers to cut down on production to realise better prices for the produce.” It had become a habit for the traders to project an exaggerated crop requirement at the time of crop fixation, and shy away from auction platforms at the time of marketing, lamented Southern Black Soil Farmers’ Association honorary president P. Bhadri Reddy. Traders’ game plan This year too, the situation was no better as they adopted a wait-and-watch attitude, hoping that the Markfed, with no carrying capacity, would withdraw from the market sooner or later for them to knock away with the produce at a throwaway price, he opined. He pressed for introduction of contract farming in cultivation of flue-cured Virginia tobacco as in the case of white burely. The growers of the latter variety got a better price in view of the agreement reached with the cigarette manufacturers. ‘Ensure MGP’ The Tobacco Board should convince the traders to announce a minimum guaranteed price (MGP) at the time of crop fixation itself so that the farmers could take a well-informed decision whether to grow the crop, or switch over to other crops, said Ongole II Farmers Association president V.V.

31 July 2020||P. Sujatha VarmaVIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Erring corporate schools to face the axe||The State government has decided to crack the whip on private and corporate schools running without the requisite permissions. The AP School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission (APSRMC) has asked the District Education Officers and Joint Directors in the department to identify and furnish a detailed information about the schools that are operating without official recognition. The commission intends to order closure of such schools. “Despite repeated warnings, certain private schools in the corporate sector have been violating norms, especially with regard to fee structure. The problem is that parents do not lodge a formal complaint. Some of them approach the media without revealing their identity. There is no direct complaint by a parent to the commission to initiate action,” says commission Chairman R. Kantha Rao. Exorbitant fee Speaking to The Hindu , the former Judge cited reports of schools collecting exorbitant fee even before the commencement of a new academic year, ignoring the government directive that only tuition fee be collected in instalments in view of the existing financial crisis on account of the COVID-19 pandemic that necessitated a prolonged lockdown affecting livelihood of people. The commission’s attention has also been drawn to the issues like teachers being denied salaries by their employers taking advantage of the COVID-19 lockdown. “But teachers do not come to us directly for fear of retrenchment,” he said, stating that there have been ludicrous cases of certain school managements insisting that their students wear school uniforms while attending even online classes. In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the commission discussed threadbare feasible options to impart education to students. While parents are divided on the efficacy of online classes for their children, the commission, after weighing pros and cons, set aside suggestions for a ‘zero academic year’ for students of classes 1 to 5. “We strongly feel that the children need to be engaged in some activity lest the long gap may leave a psychological impact on their minds besides contributing to the problem of school drop-outs,” he said. Mr. Kantha Rao admitted that due to the prevailing uncertainty, the commission was unable to give clear-cut guidelines at this point. After doubts were expressed that parents may not send their children to schools immediately after commencement of the fresh academic year for fear of virus, the panel advised the government to go ahead with its plan to conduct classes in online mode. “We are watching the situation. If it improves, we will recommend conduct of regular classes. If necessary, we will ask schools to conduct classes in shifts,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/erring-corporate-schools-to-face-the-axe/article32236173.ece
31 July 2020||Staff Reporter VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||GPS helps SEB bust illegal sand mining, transportation||Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) sleuths have recently arrested an authorised sand transporter on charges of diverting sand booked for construction of an apartment to the black market in various areas of the district. About 175 tonnes of sand, a truck and an earthmover used to excavate sand from a prohibited area have been seized. The illegal transportation and sale of sand were busted using GPS technology. According to SEB ASP Vakul Jindal, a transporter named Venkata Rao who was supposed to deliver 288 tonnes of sand for a builder in Gollapudi from Eturu sand reach under Kanchikacherla police station limits allegedly diverted huge quantity of sand to multiple destinations using the same e-way bill. “At five locations, sand had been sold for Rs. 50,000 per lorry for construction purposes to genuine consumers who couldn’t get sand otherwise. At one location in Kondapalli, the person who bought the sand was found to be selling it further in small tractors,” he said. The accused allegedly made a profit of around Rs. 3 lakh by selling the sand in the open market. The truck owner, his staff including the driver, earthmover operator and the person who sold sand in Kondapalli have also been booked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/gps-helps-seb-bust-illegal-sand-mining-transportation/article32235650.ece

After news broke a couple of days ago about Esther remaining clueless even as her mother Olivia left for Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh, both monetary and moral support kept pouring in for the women. After Vice-President of India M. Venkaiah Naidu’s daughter Deepa Venkat assured them of help to reach home, local legislator Bhumana Karunakar Reddy extended monetary aid for her sustenance. After Olivia was brought to Tirupati from Vrindavan, BJP State secretary G. Bhanuprakash Reddy formally called on them and gave a copy of the Bhagavad Gita. “This is just a symbolic gesture indicative of India’s treatment of its guests as mentioned in the adage ‘Athithi Devo Bhava’. The two are highly devout and hence are aware of the tenets in the Bhagavad Gita,” he told the media. Similarly, Superintendent of Police (Tirupati Urban) Avula Ramesh Reddy met Esther and offered all support for their travel to their home nation, understandably under the directions of the State government.

Kattamanchi Sekhar, aged 32, residing in Sapthagiri Nagar locality, was desperately trying to get himself tested for COVID-19, but failed to get a slot. With symptoms of illness, he had reportedly been visiting SVR Ruia Government General Hospital for the last three days. While waiting near the Tirumala link bus stand at Alipiri, he collapsed and breathed his last on Thursday. The onlookers preferred to stay away and none came to his rescue, fearing getting infected. Reacting to the incident, TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu took to Twitter to ridicule the State’s claim of providing a bed to a patient within half an hour. Mr. Naidu recalled that the patient had been made to visit the hospital thrice just to give a swab sample, but to no avail. Referring to the anguish and ramarks of the victim’s father that his son would have survived had a hospital bed been allotted on time, Mr. Naidu demanded an answer from the government on the incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/man-waiting-for-covid-19-test-dies/article32235671.ece

Addressing the participants, Mr. Reddy said the State government was already collaborating with Amazon for the empowerment of women entrepreneurs under the ‘Amazon Saheli’ programme, which was aimed at supporting women engaged in handicrafts and making toys and other products. He said the government was making efforts to bring back a large number of Telugu people employed in the field of Information Technology, to strengthen the sector in the State.

31 July 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Centre will not intervene on 3 capitals’ issue: Somu||BJP State president Somu Veerraju has said that the Central government will not meddle with the State’s policy decision on the development of the capital city. Addressing the media during his maiden visit to New Delhi on Thursday after being appointed as the State party president, Mr. Veerraju pointed out that there were no instances in the past of the Centre’s involvement in the setting up of various capital cities. Mr. Veerraju said the Central government had kept quiet when the former Chief Minister, N. Chandrababu Naidu, exaggerated the development of Amaravati by drawing unfair comparisons with the opulent capital cities of some countries. The Centre would maintain a similar stand of not intervening in the matter of the three capitals mooted by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. However, he insisted that injustice should not be done to the thousands of farmers who had given their multi-cropped lands under the pooling scheme for the development of Amaravati. Mr. Veerraju said the TDP was trying to drag the BJP into the capital controversy, and described the comments purportedly made by Mr. Naidu that some BJP leaders were looking to strike a chord with him, as a part of his political game. He further said that his party would make its own moves in the game of chess being played by Mr. Naidu with all seriousness warranted by the situation. Rajya Sabha member G.V.L. Narasimha Rao and party’s A.P. affairs in-charge Sunil Deodhar also spoke. It may be recalled that the BJP-Jana Sena combine had expressed its resolve to wage a legal battle against the proposed shifting of the capital from Amaravati while endorsing the idea of relocating the High Court in Kurnool by insisting that it had been a long-pending demand of the Rayalaseema region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/centre-will-not-intervene-on-3-capitals-issue-somu/article32236179.ece

He said the Y.S. Jagan Moan Reddy government had suggested replication of ‘Ámma Vodi’ scheme in schools across the country and establishment of Indian Education Service, which were included in the draft Bill. Mr. Suresh said the government supported the new policy framed at the national level and it would implement it effectively, with stress on accountability and transparency. The Minister said efforts were on to establish a digital university in Prakasam district. He said the State would effectively put forth its arguments in support of its proposal to implement English as a medium of instruction in government schools, in the Supreme Court. Stating that the government was of the view that the COVID-19 cases would come under control by August-end, Mr. Suresh said the decision to reopen schools on September 5 would be reviewed again keeping the developments in mind. JSP bats for mother tongue Jana Sena Party president Pawan Kalyan said the party supported the new Education Policy which recommended mother tongue as the medium of instruction for students up to Class V. In a statement, the JSP chief pointed to the fact his party had been opposing the Jagan government’s decision to implement English as a medium of instruction from this academic year. He said his party was not opposed to English, but it wanted the government to leave the decision on parents. He said it was imperative to keep the Telugu language alive in order to promote the rich culture and traditions of the Telugu land. APUTF upset Leaders of the Andhra Pradesh United Teachers’ Federation (APUTF) have criticised the fact that the open school system had not been included in the National Education Policy. In a statement, Federation leaders Sk. Sabjee and P.

31 July 2020||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||Pandemic takes the sheen off boutiques||In the olden days, the royal families of Bobbili and Vizianagaram would spend around Rs. 3 lakh on designing blouses and dresses for their women members for weddings and other special occasions. Now, with restrictions being imposed on the number of guests to be allowed, due to COVID-19 restrictions, they have also reduced their expenses to a few thousand rupees. Similar is the case with other high-profile customers who have a penchant for fashion design. All this has had an adverse impact on fashion designers, who had established boutiques spending heavily keeping in view the demand from customers. Each boutique, which used to employ 10 persons, now has only two workers, which indicates the drop in business. An average boutique used to earn around Rs. 2 lakh a month and after payment of wages and other recurring expenses, they used to earn an income of Rs. 50,000 a month. A boutique used to engage at least 10 skilled workers from West Bengal and Bihar, paying each of them Rs. 650 to Rs. 700 a day for intricate blouse designing on the ‘maggam’. But now, they are finding it difficult to even pay the wages for two workers. The trend of designer saris and blouses caught the fancy of women in the city a couple of decades ago. In the past, they would go to Hyderabad to get their blouses designed for special occasions like weddings. The advent of ‘maggam work’, about 10 years ago, ushered in a new fashion trend in the city. Young women found it a lucrative business venture, and set up their own boutiques after pursuing diploma and certificate courses in fashion designing. They were doing good business, until the coronavirus came along. Today, there are an estimated 200 boutiques in the city. Around 100 of the boutique organisers formed an association and named it ‘Mayukha Women’s Fashion Designers Association’.  “During the lockdown, we supported the maggam workers by giving them food and accommodation. We had also arranged to send them back home with the help of philanthropists,” she said. The association appealed to the government to support them financially to help them tide over this crisis, or at least offer them work on behalf of the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pandemic-takes-the-sheen-off-boutiques/article32236195.ece
31 July 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Pensioner Forum appeals to VPT on COVID treatment||The Ports Pensioners Forum has appealed to Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) Chairman Ram Mohan Rao to permit referring of COVID-19 cases of VPT to empanelled hospitals, or alternatively allow them to get the testing done on their own and later get the testing charges reimbursed. In a letter to the Chairman, All India Ports Pensioners Forum coordinator Gundu Appala Raju said that referring COVID-19 cases of Visakhapatnam Port Trust to the King George Hospital (KGH) or Chest Hospital, which are providing free services to patients from different corners of the city and district, was resulting in VPT patients having to wait for several hours, or in some cases, even days, to get treatment. “VPT is referring non-COVID-19 cases to empanelled hospitals. These patients have to mandatorily undergo COVID tests before admission. But the cost has to be borne by the patients,” Mr. Appala Raju said, requesting the Chairman to issue instructions to the Chief Medical Officer of VPT to cover COVID-19 tests also in the referral. He also sought provision of facilities at the isolation ward at the GJ Hospital of Port, arrange for the supply of Vitamin C and D tablets at the GJH in view of the shortage of these drugs in the city, and provision of a sanitisation tunnel at the entrance of Port Administrative Office Building (AOB) to sanitise all visitors/employees to prevent the spread of the virus. Mr. Appala Raju sought that these measures should be extended to both in-service and retired employees and their families.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pensioner-forum-appeals-to-vpt-on-covid-treatment/article32236193.ece
31 July 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Is Charu Majumdar’s ideology relevant today?||The Martyrs Week being observed from July 28 by the banned CPI (Maoist) entered the third day on Thursday, and the Agency areas of Visakhapatnam were incident-free so far. The week is observed to commemorate the death anniversary of Charu Majumdar, the founder and architect of the Naxalite movement that had begun at Naxalbari, a village in the Siliguri district of West Bengal, in 1967. Charu Majumdar had died in police custody on July 28, 1972, at the age of 53 in Kolkata. His body was not handed over to the family members. Instead, the security forces took the body to the cremation ground, where it was consigned to flames in the presence of his family members. During the week, the Maoists hold meetings to revisit Charu Majumdar’s ideology, build memorials and try to hog the limelight. Visit to Vizag Few know that Charu Majumdar had visited Visakhapatnam in 1969 when the Srikakulam peasant uprising was in full swing. Peasant leaders in the North Andhra district such as Vempatapu Satyanarayana, Adibhatla Kailasam, Subbarao Panigrahi and Panchadi Krishnamurthy drew inspiration from his ideology. Charu Majumdar, who was leading an underground movement then, had stayed in Visakhapatnam for a few days. His comrades such as K.G. Satyamurthi and Mahadev had reportedly stopped the train in which Majumdar was travelling from West Bengal a few kilometres before the Visakhapatnam Railway Station, then called Waltair station, by pulling the chain, and whisked him away to a secret hideout. His son Abhijit Majumdar, in a number of interviews later, had said that as a small boy he had accompanied his mother Lila and his two sisters to meet Charu in the hideout as he was then one of the most wanted men in the country. “He was here to resolve the dispute with the rival faction led by Nagi Reddy. He had also constituted the new Andhra State Coordination Committee,” said Ajay Kumar of the CPI (ML), a party formed by Charu Majumdar. The CPI(ML), which was then outlawed and banned, is now recognised as one of the mainstream political parties fighting the elections democratically. But is his ideology, which had attracted thousands of youth and intellectuals, relevant today? Land reforms The movement that Charu Majumdar had started was seen as an offshoot of the Tebhaga peasant movement of 1946, which was similar to the Telangana peasant movement. “The crux of the movement was implementation of land reforms and ‘land rights to the tiller’. But it had withered and lost its relevance after the liberalisation policy,” said a former Naxalite, who was drawn towards Charu’s ideology and who had worked with the People’s War Group (PWG) founded by Kondapalli Seetharamaiah. The Maoists still believe in the 1938 Mao Zedong’s doctrine that “political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.” “This is irrelevant today, as oppression may lead to an armed political struggle. But, as Charu had once said, arms are necessary, but they cannot control the movement and we cannot lose sight on mobilising people,” he said. “But today, the Maoists seem to focus more on arms, and have lost focus on mobilising popular support,” he added. Another aspect that haunts the Maoists is the Mao Zedong’s strategy of creation of liberated zones. This was possible in the 1970s in Srikakulam, Naxalbari, or for that matter in Karimnagar or Warangal (now in Telangana). But post liberalisation, things had changed, he said. “Today, we have moved towards an ‘aspirational society’, where this doctrine does not hold water. The dynamics have changed and the Maoists have not visualised the change and innovated as per the changes. That is why their ideology, which once attracted the masses, turned irrelevant,” said Mr. Ajay Kumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/is-charu-majumdars-ideology-relevant-today/article32236181.ece
31 July 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Profile of virus spread worrying factor: officials||The health department is on its toes after the district recorded over 8,800 new COVID-19 positive cases in the last seven weeks. Of the total cases, 80% are from GVMC limits. However, more than the numbers, what is worrying officials is the profile of the spread of the virus. Of the 8,971 cases recorded till Wednesday night, around 1,200 are from areas such as Appughar, Pedajalaripeta, Dandu Bazaar, Anakapalle and Jodugulapalem, while the rest are spread across the district, with GVMC taking the major share. This indicates that a community spread of the virus has begun and as per ICMR research, it is yet to reach its peak. The increase in the number of clusters or containment zones from 35 to 674 within two months is indicative of the range of the spread of COVID-19 in the district. Of the 674 clusters, 112 are very active clusters and 240 are active clusters while 322 are dormant clusters. “But it has been a long time that the number of de-notified clusters, which are 39, has not changed or increased in the last one month. This indicates that every day, a couple of new cases are being detected from the existing clusters, apart from new cases from newer areas,” said Dr. Sudhakar. A cluster becomes de-notified when no positive case is recorded from there for a period of two weeks. Maintaining protocol Both the district administration and health officials expressed dismay over the flouting of basic protocols. “Despite the spike, the rush at the markets ahead of Varalakshmi Vratam is alarming. It is surprising to see even educated people forgetting the basic norms of wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing. We are worried about another massive spurt after the festival,” Dr. Sudhakar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/profile-of-virus-spread-worrying-factor-officials/article32236201.ece

Though the police suspect that a failed relationship might be the reason behind the woman’s extreme step, they are yet to arrive at a definite conclusion. The deceased was identified as Vaishnavi (23), hailing from Raipur, who was living in Vizag city. Assistant Commissioner of Police (West) G. Swaroopa Rani said that as per their primary investigation, Vaishnavi was in a relationship with a man who was living in another flat in the same apartment. On Thursday, she went to the man’s house and jumped off the balcony at around 2 p.m. Pendurthi police have booked a case and have launched an investigation.

31 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CSIR-IICT aided pharma firm in making Favipiravir drug||A brain-storming of scientists on the New Year followed by a meeting with Cipla’s chairman Y.K. Hamied led to CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) to commence weeks of round-the-clock research for developing the affordable version of Favipiravir drug to treat COVID-19, said CSIR-IICT director S. Chandrasekhar on Thursday. “When the pandemic broke out, my first thought was to look for possible methods to introduce a drug at the earliest. But, soon a realisation dawned that a new drug will take at least eight to 10 years and millions of dollars of investment, which means no instant solutions were available,” he explained, giving an overview of how the premier institute in the city went about developing the indigenous version of the drug. The concept of ‘repurposing of drugs’ (using drugs made for some neglected diseases for other diseases) took shape during the annual New Year meeting with his research group and senior colleagues Dr. Raji Reddy and Dr. Prathama, when COVID was yet to be declared a pandemic. This happened along with a meeting with Dr. Hamied and the Cipla team, on his invitation at Mumbai, where discussions on collaborative projects led to the team up between both the organisations, he said. IICT scientists went about scouring scientific literature for “some known anti-viral drugs” prescribed by doctors to save lives. Drug molecules Remdesivir, Favipiravir and Umifenovir, working on diseases closely related to SARS, were screened for their efficacy against coronavirus. The search was narrowed down further to the old Japanese off-patent antiviral drug Favipiravir, structurally looking like a twin brother of pyrazinamide (anti-TB drug) and Remdevisir, a clinical molecule of Gilead firm. “We considered Favipiravir first for a quick solution,” recalled Dr. Chandrasekhar. But, then countrywide lockdown and global supply chain disruption threw different kind of challenges of mobility and materials. A select batch of scientists and research students were chosen to stay back in the hostel and guest house for uninterrupted lab activity. “We had to develop raw materials sourced from Indian companies and through an elaborate process, we could identify the chemical available locally,” he added. Once the molecule was ready, Cipla top managers Manjinder Singh and Sharadd Jain drove all the way by car from Mumbai for 15 hours, with packed food and water, as hotels were shut, taking special permissions during the lockdown to reach IICT to pick up the formulation so as to hasten the process of regulatory approvals. “We could complete the entire Favipiravir process in a record four weeks for Cipla, thanks to the support extended by CSIR DG Shekhar C. Mande,” the director said. Indigenous chemicals sourced from Indian companies and bringing down the import dependency helped an affordable version of the drug being made available to the country, Dr. Chandrasekhar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/csir-iict-aided-pharma-firm-in-making-favipiravir-drug/article32235940.ece
31 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Be vigilant to check camel slaughter: HC||The Telangana High Court on Thursday directed the State government to ensure that the official machinery was vigilant to check slaughter of camels on the eve of Bakrid. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy, hearing a PIL plea on illegal transportation and slaughter of camels, suggested that the government undertake a massive campaign to enlighten people that slaughtering of camels would attract penal action. The bench observed that people at large were under the impression that killing camels was not violation of law. “All of us know that Hyderabad is a great centre for non-vegetarian food. One cannot have non-vegetarian food unless animal is slaughtered. But there are rules and regulations governing slaughtering of animals,” the bench observed. Petitioner K. Shashikala contended that camels were being illegally transported into Telangana from other States for slaughter. The petitioner apprehended that slaughter of camels was likely to go up during Bakrid festival. The Special Government Pleader, citing the report furnished by the Animal Husbandry Director before the court, said eight committees were constituted to inspect abattoirs. These committees comprising officials from police, animal husbandry and civic bodies would raid abattoirs or butcher shops. After listening to the contentions of SGP G. Sanjeev Kumar, the bench instructed the official machinery to keep tabs on illegal slaughter of animals, especially camels, in the backdrop of Bakrid to be observed on Saturday. Even a goat cannot be killed by a butcher without certification by the veterinary doctor. “There is possibility of virus transmitting from animals to human beings as coronavirus got transmitted from bats to human beings. That engulfed entire world now and became a pandemic,” the bench remarked. Official machinery was geared up to check illegal slaughter of animals, be it sheep or camels, the SGP said. The petition was posted for August 5.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/be-vigilant-to-check-camel-slaughter-hc/article32235944.ece
31 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||3 of family die of COVID in one week||There was no end to tragedy for a family from Maheshwaram mandal of Rangareddy district as three of their loved ones died fighting COVID within a week. Six hours after Anreddy Radhesh (21) performed the funeral of his mother Anreddy Sukumari (60) on Tuesday afternoon, he got the news of his father Satyanarayana Reddy (60)’s death. Mr. Radhesh’s cousin Anreddy Harishchandra Reddy (36) died on July 23. This even after the family spent over Rs. 40 lakh for their treatment and medicines. “We paid Rs. 40 lakh for their treatment and all we got are three dead bodies,” said Harishchandra’s father Anreddy Ram Reddy. The family alleged that two private hospitals had charged them massive bills. Mr. Radhesh also had an issue with the Deccan Hospital, Somajiguda, where his father was admitted. “Despite reminding them, they took more than four hours to change his soiled diapers. The bill for my father’s treatment was Rs. 17.5 lakh,” he alleged. However, the hospital said the bill was Rs. 12.04 lakh, out of which they waived off Rs. 2 lakh. The family paid around Rs. 18 lakh for Harishchandra’s treatment in another hospital. Satyanarayana and Sukumari got admitted to Deccan Hospital on July 10. They left against medical advice on July 13, but when Satyanarayana developed breathlessness, he was again admitted there on July 15. “My mother was admitted to AIG on July 17. She developed clots, was in coma for three days, and died on July 27 midnight. The overall bill came to around Rs. 4 lakh. When I was performing her funeral the next day at around 3 p.m., I received a call from my father who said his diapers were not changed. I did not tell my father about my mother’s death. I immediately called Deccan Hospital requesting for it to be changed,” Mr. Radhesh said. Mr. Radhesh alleged that the hospital said they would hand over the body if Rs. 7.5 lakh was paid. “No one should face the problems I have faced,” he tweeted. MAUD Minister K.T. Rama Rao responded by requesting Eatala Rajender to take stringent action. COO of Deccan Hospital Lilly Saleem said that the bill was Rs. 12.04 lakh, and denied the allegation that they asked for Rs. 7.5 lakh to hand over the body. She said that diaper was changed in half-an-hour after receiving the call from Radesh around 6 p.m. She added that they have followed government prescribed charges for COVID treatment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/3-of-family-die-of-covid-in-one-week/article32235935.ece
31 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Drones to address mosquito menace||The GHMC is deploying drones and mosquito zapper machines to address the perennial issue of mosquitoes in and around river Musi. Mosquito zappers with a range of one acre area have been installed in Bapu Ghat, Lakshmi Nagar Colony and Jiyaguda areas. These machines will attract adult mosquitoes within their range, and incinerate them. Three of these machines had been experimented with in the High Court where mosquitoes were a problem owing to proximity to the Musi, before they were deployed in the aforementioned areas, officials said. The GHMC is paying special focus on control of mosquito spread in the Musi, as the river flows 21 kilometres through the city, covering four of the six zones, including Khairatabad, Charminar, Secunderabad and L. B. Nagar, and 14 divisions in them. Anti-larval and fogging operations will be intensified in areas abutting the river such as Errakunta lake, Puranapul, Nayapul, Shivaji bridge, Bhadrapur Housing Board Colony, N. M. Guda, H. V. Colony, Miralam tank, Palle cheruvu, and Attapur. A total of 80,000 residents live in over 16,000 houses surrounding the river, which exposes them to the breeding centre of mosquitoes and vector-borne diseases such as malaria. To address the issue, three units with 50 workers have been formed by the Entomology department. To monitor anti-larval operations and fogging in the river, two senior entomologists and two assistant entomologists have been deployed. One drone is being used to spray the anti-larval chemical on the river, while six vehicle mounted fogging machines too have been pressed into the operations, besides 15 portable fogging machines. The Musi Development Corporation is helping by taking up de-silting and cleaning operations of the river, through 15 earth-moving machines. This would prevent stagnation of sewage in the river, a statement by the GHMC said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/drones-to-address-mosquito-menace/article32235949.ece

31 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Why no action against Niloufer diet contractor?’||Wondering what was compelling the State government to continue a diet contractor in Niloufer Hospital even after allegations of corruption were levelled against him, the Telangana High Court on Thursday sought to know why no action had been initiated against him so far. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy, hearing a PIL petition on ‘misappropriation of funds by the diet contractor’, asked the government what prevented the government from fixing up responsibility in the matter. P. Bhagvantha Rao of Bhagynagar Ganesh Utsava Samithi, who filed the PIL plea, maintained that the contractor was being continued by the hospital superintendent even after the inquiry report was submitted. The work of supplying food to patients of the hospital assigned to the contractor ended this March. Still, the same contractor was being allowed to supply diet to the patients. The petitioner pleaded with the court to direct the government to terminate the diet contract and launch an investigation by the Crime Investigation Department into the ‘misappropriation of funds and irregularities’ by the contractor. He told the bench that for some reasons, the government awarded the work of supplying diet to in-patients in Gandhi hospital and Chest hospital, Erragadda, also. Responding to the clarifications sought by the bench, government counsel said no money was paid to the contractor after charges of corruption against him surfaced. A report was presented to the government following the inquiry into the allegations. Action by the government was awaited, counsel informed the court, seeking two weeks to secure instructions on the matter. The contractor’s counsel told the court that his client had been in the field of supplying diet to in-patients of the hospitals for the past 30 years. A rival group, which failed to obtain the contract of supplying diet, was attempting to damage his work by waging legal battles. The bench instructed the government to place before it the inquiry committee report by August 17. The petition was posted for August 19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/why-no-action-against-niloufer-diet-contractor/article32235945.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao, in Siddipet district on Thursday. Terming the incident as politically instigated, Finance Minister T. Harish Rao announced an immediate assistance of Rs. 2 lakh and an acre of land to the family of the deceased. He has also assured to get the child of the deceased farmer educated at government expense. According to sources, Dalit farmer Byagari Narasimhulu had 13 guntas of assigned land and the district authorities proposed to resume it for the construction rythu vedika. Worried by the move of the authorities, the young farmer consumed a poisonous substance on his farm on Wednesday and he was immediately shifted to government hospital at Gajwel for treatment where he breathed last in the early morning of Thursday. Tension prevailed in the village due to his death and family members held a dharna before the residence of sarpanch T. Papi Reddy holding him responsible for death of Narasimhulu. A huge police force was mobilised as a precautionary measure. The officials said that the land had been resumed in 2014 as the father of the farmer had sold the inherited assigned land to another person, in violation of assignment regulations, and that the farmer had not been cultivating the land for the past several years. The body was shifted to government hospital for post mortem and a few Congress leaders reached the hospital. The death assumed political colours with leaders of the opposition parties terming it a ‘murder’ by the ruling party while the TRS called it politically instigated. Responding to the incident, the Finance Minister termed it most unfortunate and politically instigated. “It is not a fact that the government had forcibly resumed the land from Narasimhulu. It was resumed during the Congress regime for construction of a power station. We will order an inquiry and punish those responsible for his death,” he told reporters at Gajwel on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ryot-ends-life-as-authorities-plan-rythu-vedika-on-his-land/article32235966.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||A welcome petrichor||Malayalam cinema has a knack of artfully presenting the most ordinary aspects of daily life, without romanticising it. Director Dileesh Pothan’s 2016 film Maheshinte Prathikaram is a fine example, narrating a story that looks deceptively simple and also documenting life in the picturesque Idukki. It seems befitting that director Venkatesh Maha, who took us into the close-to-reality realm of Kancharapalem in his debut film Care of Kancharapalem , picked up this Malayalam film for a remake. Now streaming on Netflix, Uma Maheshwara Ugra Roopasya (UMUR) is a worthwhile remake, soaking in the charm of Araku valley. Cinematographer Appu Prabhakar, music composer Bijibal and the production design give wings to Maha’s intent of re-creating a heart-warming tale of love, hurt, anger and a quest for self respect. There’s eye-pleasing, calming greenery and we also see the smallest of things that locals in Araku indulge in, and yet it remains raw without being glossed over. Among the many mood uplifting songs, ‘Ningi chutte’ is an instant earworm. Blending into this world is actor Satyadev, drawing from the strength of not yet being burdened by a star image. If you’ve seen the original, it will take a few minutes to shake off the memories of watching Fahadh Faasil. But it doesn’t take long to warm up to Satyadev as Mahesh, or Mahesh-u to be precise. Mahesh runs the non-descript Komali Photo Studio, and his photography follows a set method of ‘Chin up, shoulder down, eyes open, ready…’ routine. The results are funny but he’s pleased with the images. The different facets of life in Araku are depicted through the various characters. The bone setter Babji (V K Naresh), his assistant Suhas (Suhas) and Nancharayya (TNR) are Mahesh’s close aides. When the film begins, Mahesh’s father Manohar Rao (K Raghavan) is the odd one out but this character is revealed beautifully, reminding us to take a closer look at people, especially the elderly.

31 July 2020||New Delhi,||Govt. cuts VAT on diesel, price down by over Rs. 8||The Delhi Cabinet decided to slash Value Added Tax (VAT) rates on diesel effectively reducing its price to Rs. 73.64 down from Rs. 82 per litre, said Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday. He said the reduction of VAT from 30% to 16.75% would lead to a dip in the per litre cost of the fuel by Rs. 8.36 per litre. Mr. Kejriwal added that the move would not only bring huge relief to the people of Delhi but also would also be a big step towards boosting economic revival in the Capital. The Delhi government had, on May 4, ordered an increase in VAT on petrol to 30% from 27% and on diesel to 30% from 16.75%. Dip in State revenue The order had come into effect the following day and was in response to dipping State revenue on account of the national lockdown to contain the pandemic. “The two crore people of Delhi have brought COVID-19 under control. However, we need to ensure social distancing and wear masks, because if we become complacent, the virus might spike again. We now need to focus on how we can revive the economy of Delhi because many people have been affected due to shutting down of businesses and industries,” he said. “The people of Delhi have accepted big challenges in the past and have overcome them. We will accept and win this economic challenge as well. A crucial decision was taken in a Cabinet meeting held today, which I believe will be an important step in taking the economy forward,” he added. Many industry representatives, businessmen and traders were demanding a reduction in the prices of diesel because its price was affecting the budget of the people in addition to impacting trade and businesses. The decision to slash VAT, and, in effect, reduce diesel prices, was taken after consultations between the Delhi government and several stakeholders, Mr. Kejriwal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/govt-cuts-vat-on-diesel-price-down-by-over-rs-8/article32235853.ece
31 July 2020||New Delhi,||‘BJP govt. should lower petrol and diesel prices’||After the Delhi government decided to reduce VAT on diesel on Thursday, the AAP later in the day said diesel “is the lifeblood of the economy” and the decrease in its prices will act as “sanjeevani booti” in reviving an “unconscious economy”. “On the other hand, the BJP-led Centre adopted an extortionist approach and increased excise duty on diesel and petrol 22 times over 22 continuous days from June 7, 2020, to June 29 2020. They should take a leaf out of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s book and rollback,” said AAP leader Raghav Chadha at a press conference. He added that the Centre should decrease the price of petrol by Rs. 24/litre and diesel by Rs. 28/litre. The BJP government has hiked the excise duty on petrol by 260% petrol and diesel price by 820% from 2014, the AAP said. Party leader Durgesh Pathak also alleged corruption in the allocation of funds to gaushalas by the BJP-ruled municipal corporations. ‘Rs. 30 crore pending’ “Nearly 25,000 cattle in Delhi are suffering from scarcity of food. The BJP is responsible in Delhi for this negligence of the cows because they have not paid the requisite amount for their maintenance for three years from the civic bodies. There is a pending Rs. 30 crore from the civic bodies,” Mr. Pathak said. The AAP said the government has always paid the money on time. “In the last three years, the civic bodies have not paid single rupee for the cow shelters in the last three years,” he added. The BJP harasses people and asks for votes in the name of cows and Delhi has four government cow shelters where nearly 25,000 cows stay, said AAP. “According to the rules, the government pays Rs. 20 per day per cow and the same money should be given by civic bodies. This amounts to Rs. 10-Rs. 11 crores for the government per year,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bjp-govt-should-lower-petrol-and-diesel-prices/article32235854.ece
31 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||Govt. ignoring their plight, allege JJ cluster residents||The residents of Anna Nagar JJ cluster — where 12 houses were swept away 12 days ago — still continue to live in tents and expect a “closure”. “There has been no word from the government. At least they should tell us if they are even planning to take action. They should tell us if we need to start looking for accommodation ourselves so that we can prepare accordingly,” said Kuber Chandra Kotiyal, a resident who works as a security guard. The residents said they have been living in open tents since July 19 and while officials have visited them, nothing has changed. “A local MLA had visited four days ago. After we shared our problems, he promised us a bigger tent and mattresses. We haven’t received anything yet,” said Neha, another resident. Earlier, the residents would rush to the Indraprastha Metro Station whenever it rained. However, the security personnel there have allegedly forbidden them from taking shelter now. “For the last few days, we are not being allowed to enter. Hence, we stay here in the tents whenever it rains,” said Baljeet. The residents said they have been struggling for basic requirements. “We are not given breakfast. Even if I buy milk, I have to boil it in a neighbour’s house. How long will they entertain us after all?” asked Kotiyal. ‘A permanent place’ The residents said they would be content with even just a roof over their heads. “We just need a permanent place to stay. Whatever losses we have incurred, nothing can be done. We will buy things again with our meagre earnings, but we do need a roof to stay,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/govt-ignoring-their-plight-allege-jj-cluster-residents/article32235846.ece
31 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||Kin suspect foul play in police officer’s death||Two days after a Delhi police officer allegedly shot himself in South Delhi, his family raised suspicion over his death and demanded a fair investigation. Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Thakur on Tuesday had stated that “it has come to knowledge that he was upset due to the long illness of his elder brother”. However, the deceased’s family refuted the claim. Brother’s illness Speaking to The Hindu , the officer’s brother, a 35-year-old serving Army officer, said that he has been undergoing treatment for ulcers for the last one year at R&R Hospital in Delhi but that wasn’t the reason why he took the step, they feel. “Yes, I was under treatment and he used to visit the hospital often for medicines and other things but he couldn’t have done this because of me. We can’t believe that. In fact, I was discharged from the hospital on July 7,” he said. The family denied that the officer could take his own life. “We can’t understand why he would do this? He didn’t share any problems with us. We don’t think it’s a black and white case and we want to know what exactly happened,” the brother said. The family said that they were visited by senior officers on Wednesday. “We told them to investigate his death in a fair manner and also asked them to tell us what they find,” he said. A senior police officer privy to the case said that they have not found any foul play as of now. “Forensic Science Laboratory team inspected the spot and the post-mortem has been conducted by a board of doctors at AIIMS. None of the parties have suspected foul play. However, inquest proceedings are under way,” he said. The 33-year-old head constable posted at Saket police station allegedly shot himself dead using his service pistol on Tuesday morning. The deceased is survived by his wife and two children.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/kin-suspect-foul-play-in-police-officers-death/article32235847.ece

Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Legislative Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, said the decision would definitely provide relief to the people but VAT on diesel needed to be reduced to 12.5% and to 20% on petrol. “Before Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal came to power, VAT in Delhi was charged at the rate of 12.5% on diesel. This was increased from 12.5 to 30% during the Kejriwal government’s tenure while the VAT on petrol was also increased from 20% to 30%,” Mr. Bidhuri said. “If the government wants to give relief to the people of Delhi, then it should charge VAT at the rate of 12.5% on diesel and 20% on petrol. Ever since the government increased the VAT rate on diesel and petrol, the BJP has been demanding a reduction,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bjp-supports-move-but-says-not-enough/article32235851.ece
31 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘NEP a progressive document but comes with flaws’||Education Minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday said the National Education Policy (NEP) was a forward-looking and progressive document that acknowledges the flaws in our education system and seeks to better it. However, he said the problem with the policy is that there is no clarity on how it is to be implemented and does not break-free from the pressures of the old education system. ‘Poorly funded’ “The NEP is poorly funded and highly regulated policy that has multiple regulatory bodies that will end up clashing with each other,” the Minister said, adding that it is a welcome move that 6% of the GDP needs to be devoted to education. Mr. Sisodia has called for a law to ensure that the funding is received during the Budget else, it would be impossible to roll-out the policy. He said the positive aspects of the policy include that the HRD Ministry will now be an Education Ministry and also hoped for a change in the way the Ministry works. “For the first time, early childhood education has been brought in the mainframe and there are talks about serving breakfast along with lunch under the mid-day meal scheme. Instruction during foundation years in mother tongue is also a positive step,” Mr. Sisodia said. One of the biggest flaws he said was the policy does not talk about how to improve government schools but encourages private ones. The Minister said a four-year B.Ed course for future teachers was a good step but questioned why the policy does not talk about training existing teachers. Elaborating on why he felt that the policy does not break away from the traditional education system, Mr. Sisodia said: “The policy says that board examinations will be made easier and conducted twice a year. Board examinations do not need to be made tougher or easier but it needs to do away with rote learning and move to a continuous assessment model instead.” He pointed out that the policy was completely silent on sports. He said he hoped that the Centre looks into the suggestions made by him as there was still time to make changes to the document.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/nep-a-progressive-document-but-comes-with-flaws/article32235850.ece

The 17-page letter by advocates Sarthak Nayak and Kanchan Rai of Let Us Talk Foundation stated, “The forensic team reached his [Rajput’s] house the next day ... the house was not sealed immediately and was easily accessible. Even though more than 40 persons have already been interrogated but till now FIR has not been registered and not a single person has been arrested. The lapse in the time will provide sufficient opportunity to the real accused to seek anticipatory bail.” Rajput, 34, was found dead in his Bandra home on June 14. The letter said, “Mumbai Police quite irresponsibly gave a statement before media that he was under depression and was taking medicines without ascertaining any facts. Rajput’s father in the FIR had alleged that actor Rhea Chakraborty self-medicated him and gave him overdose of medicines.” Police visit Rhea’s home Meanwhile, the visiting Bihar police team on Thursday started the process of scrutinising financial transactions and bank account details of Rajput, according to a Mumbai Crime Branch official. The team from Bihar, which arrived here on Wednesday, visited several places, including the residence of Ms. Chakraborty, who is facing ‘abetment to suicide’ charge in a FIR filed in Patna, but did not find her at home, the official said. The police team visited a Bandra-based bank where Rajput had an account. They are also looking into evidence collected so far by the Mumbai Police and statements recorded by them. They are expected to question some people linked to Rajput, including his ex-girlfriend, actor Ankita Lokhande, the official said.

31 July 2020||Mumbai,||Ram temple at Ayodhya symbol of social harmony, says VHP||The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Thursday said the ceremony on August 5 to mark the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya will showcase the togetherness of the country and motivate people to celebrate social harmony, and national unity and pride. The VHP, which is affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has urged people to organise pujas on August 5, light lamps in the evening, and make a donation to a good cause. At a press conference in Nagpur, Milind Parande, central secretary general of the VHP, said, “Lord Ram gave the message of social harmony and empowerment from his own life. Water and soil will be carried to Ayodhya from thousands of holy rivers, pilgrimage centres and shrines across the country to form a part and parcel of the foundation and consecration ceremony of the temple.” Taking on critics On Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar’s statement that building the temple will not cure COVID-19, Mr. Parande said only those working against the interests of Hindus will make such statements. “Each and every person concerned about national interests must not oppose the temple. Some people have made opposition to the Ram temple their profession. The Supreme Court has given its verdict and those who swear by the Constitution must abide by it,” he said. Mr. Parande said the temple’s construction is a matter of pride for Hindus. He said the emancipation of Ahalya by lord Ram, high esteem shown to Shabari Mata and camaraderie with Nishadraj are illustrations of social harmony. He said soil and water will be carried to Ayodhya from historical places such as Nagpur, the birthplace of the RSS; Kashi, the birthplace of Sant Ravidasji; and Mahu, the birthplace of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar. Mr. Parande said that soil and water will also be transported to Ayodhya from Maharshi Valmiki Ashram at Sitamarhi in Bihar, Kachargad in Gondia district in Vidarbha, Ramrekhadham in Jharkhand, Tantya Bheel’s holy land in Madhya Pradesh, the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Jain Lal Mandir in Delhi, and Valmiki Temple in Delhi, where Mahatma Gandhi stayed for 72 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ram-temple-at-ayodhya-symbol-of-social-harmony-says-vhp/article32235876.ece

Following the meeting, Mr. Tambe took to Twitter and said the Youth Congress would start State-wide agitations if the Governor fails to meet their demand.

The delegation also said universities should not charge fees as there is no clarity when colleges will reopen and exams will be conducted. It also demanded varsities to refund the exam fees collected from students. The other demands included promoting students with backlogs and promptly providing stipends and fellowships to research students registered under State universities. The delegation also said students working on the ground and volunteering to help authorities fight COVID-19 should be paid through an ‘earn and learn scheme’ in order to encourage more students to come forward and serve society.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/youth-congress-urges-governor-to-cancel-final-year-varsity-exams/article32235878.ece
31 July 2020||Pune,||Expedite setting up of jumbo hospitals: CM to Pune officials||Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday directed the Pune district administration to expedite the setting up of the proposed three jumbo hospitals to tackle the surge in COVID-19 cases and constantly monitor the availability of beds. In his first visit to Pune since the start of the outbreak, Mr. Thackeray urged MLAs and MPs from the district to push the Centre at their respective levels to ensure that the district’s hospitals have adequate supplies of ventilators, personal protective equipment and N-95 masks from September 1. ‘Reduce case growth rate’ At a meeting at the Vidhan Bhavan, Mr. Thackeray said, “Elected representatives must act as a bridge between the administration and the people. Everybody must act in unison and make a determined effort to bring down the case growth and fatality rates. I have already directed officials to form a task force for clinically ill patients in every district. While the State has already requested the Centre to provide medical equipment to cope with the rise in cases after August, I urge all local leaders from Pune to do the same.” The Chief Minister urged the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to take the lead in streamlining the bed management system and making sure correct data is uploaded on its dashboard. He said the civic bodies in Nashik and Aurangabad districts must ramp up their medical infrastructure to deal with the spike in cases. Mr. Thackeray said, “The State government will give all necessary funds to these civic bodies to bring the contagion under control. Private labs must immediately refer patients who have tested positive to PMC authorities. They can then arrange for treatment immediately.” Mr. Thackeray’s visit follows criticism from the Opposition, especially the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Shivajinagar MLA Siddharth Shirole and party State president Chandrakant Patil, that the Chief Minister has abandoned Pune to its fate. ‘Fix inauguration date’ Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Shirole said he had urged the Chief Minister to direct the district administration to declare a date when the three jumbo facilities will be opened. “While we welcome the directive of setting up three jumbo hospitals in the city, I have demanded that the administration declare a fixed date as to when these facilities would be set up, given that authorities are giving multiple dates and likely possibilities,” he said. He also demanded daily monitoring of the COVID-19 situation by the State government. Mr. Shirole said the PMC needs to evaluate the “worst-case scenario” in cases and fatalities at the end of every month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/expedite-setting-up-of-jumbo-hospitals-cm-to-pune-officials/article32235880.ece

31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||Trump suggests postponing election||U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested postponing the November 3 presidential election in order to avoid voting by mail, which he has repeatedly called fraudulent, without basis. Mr. Trump tweeted out his suggestion shortly after news broke that the U.S. economy had experienced a record level of contraction in the second quarter of this year. “With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???” Mr. Trump tweeted just after news emerged that the U.S. economy had shrunk by a post-war record of 32.9% on an annualised basis as per preliminary estimates from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Minutes prior to tweeting out his suggestion, the President had tweeted that voting by mail was a “catastrophic disaster”. ‘Catastrophic disaster’ “Mail-In Voting is already proving to be a catastrophic disaster. Even testing areas are way off. The Dems talk of foreign influence in voting, but they know that Mail-In Voting is an easy way for foreign countries to enter the race. Even beyond that, there’s no accurate count!” he said on Thursday morning. Despite the President’s claims, there is no significant evidence of extensive fraud when voting happens by mail. “Never in American history — not even during the Civil War and World War II — has there been a successful move to ‘Delay the Election’ for President,” Presidential historian Michael Beschloss said on Twitter. Fifteen States had postponed their primaries or switched to vote by mail with extended deadlines, the New York Times had reported earlier this year. These were in compliance with State laws. Postponing the general election is a lot more complex though. Changes to Election Day, which, by law, is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November in an election year, can be effected only by changing the law. For this to happen, the U.S. Senate and House — which is controlled by Democrats — would need to vote for such legislation. “Let’s be clear: Trump does not have the ability to delay the election. Our elections are enshrined in the Constitution. The Constitution also says that if the date of the election is to be changed, it must be changed by Congress,” Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-suggests-postponing-election/article32235551.ece
31 July 2020||Moscow,||Russia jails U.S. ex-marine for 9 years||A Russian court on Thursday sentenced former U.S. marine Trevor Reed to nine years in prison for assaulting police officers while drunk last year. His conviction follows the high-profile trial of another former U.S. marine Paul Whelan last month on espionage charges in a case that has fuelled speculation of a prisoner exchange with the United States. Reed, a 29-year-old student and former marine from Texas, allegedly attacked police after attending a party in Moscow. While being driven to a police station, he purportedly grabbed the arm of a police officer, causing the car they were in to swerve, and elbowed another officer in the abdomen. Reed appeared wearing a facemask in a cage for defendants in a courtroom in Moscow as the judge read out the guilty verdict, saying the police officers had suffered “mental and physical harm”. The court ruled that Reed’s “state of intoxication” had played a decisive role in the incident and sentenced him to nine years in a penal colony. Reed denounced the verdict as “completely political” and vowed to appeal to the U.S. government for political support. A representative of the US embassy at the hearing declined to comment on the verdict.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-jails-us-ex-marine-for-9-years/article32235549.ece
31 July 2020||Beijing,||China conducts drills in South China Sea||Beijing recently conducted “high-intensity” naval exercises in the South China Sea, China’s Defence Ministry said on Thursday, as tensions grow over the Asian power’s manoeuvres in the contested waters. China’s expanding military presence in the region has worried several of its neighbours, while the U.S. has vowed to stand up against Beijing’s territorial claims to much of the South China Sea, including the contested Paracel Islands. Chinese H-6G and H-6J jet bombers carried out “high-intensity training, and completed day-and-night training exercises in taking off and landing, long-range assault, and attacks on sea targets,” Defence Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said at a virtual press conference. Mr. Ren said the exercises were part of routine training and had “achieved the expected results”, without giving their specific location. China — which is locked in disputes with neighbours including India, Japan and Vietnam over islands in the South China Sea — has infuriated other nations by building artificial islands with military installations in parts of the sea. Washington declared earlier this month that Beijing’s claims to most of the sea are illegal, ramping up support for Southeast Asian nations with claims to parts of it. The region is believed to have valuable oil and gas deposits. Australia has also rejected Beijing’s territorial and maritime claims in the sea, saying there was “no legal basis” to several of China’s claims. The U.S. regularly conducts so-called “freedom of navigation operations” in the South China Sea in order to stand up to Beijing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-conducts-drills-in-south-china-sea/article32235540.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||Gandhi-King initiative passes U.S. House committee||A Bill authored by American civil rights leader and lawmaker John Lewis, which seeks to establish an exchange programme between India and the U.S. to study the work and legacies of Mahatma Gandhi and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., passed an important committee in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday, days after Mr. Lewis’s death. The Bill, co-sponsored by Indian American Congressman from California Ami Bera will establish annual scholar and student exchange programmes for Indians and Americans to study the leaders’ legacies and visit historic sites in India and the U.S., relevant to the India’s freedom struggle and the U.S.’s civil rights movement. The Bill also seeks to establish the Gandhi-King Global Academy, a conflict resolution initiative based on the principles of non-violence. It proposes the establishment of the U.S.-India Gandhi-King Development Foundation set up by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the government of India, organised under Indian law. The Foundation, which has a proposed budget authorised of up to $30 million per year for five years through 2025, is tasked with administering grants to NGOs that work in health, pollution and climate change, education and empowerment of women. Ftting tribute “Just like Gandhi and Dr. King, Congressman Lewis shaped the world through his actions of non-violence, and his life story will reverberate throughout history. The Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act is a fitting tribute to his incredible legacy,” Mr. Bera, who heads the influential Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and Non-proliferation, said. “As the world’s oldest and largest democracies, the U.S. and India have long traditions of upholding these shared values championed by figures like Gandhi, King, and Congressman Lewis. But they are increasingly under threat in both countries. This legislation will help ensure those values endure and remind us that by holding true to them, we embody and live up to the best of our two nations,” he said. Other co-sponsors included Indian American Democratic lawmakers Pramila Jayapal (Washington state), Ro Khanna (California) and Raja Krishnamoorthi (Illinois). The Bill was inspired by Mr. Lewis’s visit to India in 2009 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Dr. King’s visit to India, according to an email from Mr. Bera’s office. The Bill will need to be voted through the House and Senate before it becomes law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/gandhi-king-initiative-passes-us-house-committee/article32235543.ece
31 July 2020||Hong Kong,||Hong Kong bars 12 opposition candidates from election||Hong Kong’s government said on Thursday 12 pro-democracy candidates had been disqualified from running for election to the legislature, citing opposition to a new national security law imposed by Beijing, but denied infringing civil rights. Disqualified candidates included pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong, some members of the Civic Party, a moderate, old-guard opposition group, and others who won an unofficial ”primary” vote held by the opposition camp this month. The move is sure to infuriate supporters of democracy, a month after Communist Party rulers in Beijing announced the national security law that reins in dissent in the semi-autonomous city. It could also steer China further onto a collision path with the West. The government said there could be more disqualifications. Critics said the move sought to curb the ascendancy of a young, more defiant generation of pro-democracy activists after an overwhelming win in last year’s lower-level district council elections. “Clearly, #Beijing shows a total disregard for the will of the #Hongkongers, tramples upon the citys last pillar of vanishing autonomy and attempts to keep #HKs legislature under its firm grip,” Mr. Wong tweeted. Possibility of poll delay Chances for a historic majority in the Legislative Council, or mini-parliament, for the opposition camp will take a further blow if the government decides to postpone the September 6 vote, as expected, amid the pandemic. Hong Kong has disqualified candidates before but not on this scale. The disqualification of Civic Party candidates signals Beijing is becoming less tolerant of even moderate democrats, who have for decades been a vocal opposition in the legislature. “The government is constructing a CCP (Chinese Communist Party) Assembly in Legco to eliminate most of the opposition voices. Outrageous, Nathan Law, a pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker who was kicked out of the legislature, said on Twitter. Mr. Law fled Hong Kong for Britain earlier this month. The Civic Party said its existence is not confined to the legislature, often referred to as Legco, and it will continue to work for its values.“When the regime wishes to enslave us, the best thing to do is to stand firm and tell the regime we would not change,” said Civic Party member Kwok Ka-ki, who was among those disqualified. Meanwhile, Hong Kong police have arrested four people aged 16-21 for suspected offences under the city's new national security law, the first such detentions outside of street protests since the legislation took effect a month ago. “We arrested for ... subversions and for the organising and also the inciting (of) secession,” said Li Kwai-wah, police superintendent. “They wanted to unite all the independent groups to promote the independence of Hong Kong.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hong-kong-bars-12-opposition-candidates-from-election/article32235545.ece
31 July 2020||HANOI,||After 99 days of success, virus returns to haunt Vietnam||For 99 days, Vietnam seemed to have defeated the COVID-19 pandemic. There wasn’t a single reported case of community transmission. Not a single death. The country of 96 million people was hailed globally as a standout success. But then a week ago, an outbreak began that has now grown to 43 cases in six parts of the country, including three of the largest cities, and forced authorities to reimpose restrictions many thought they had put behind them. And experts worry the outbreak could be much larger than currently known. The outbreak began last Thursday in the coastal city of Da Nang, where thousands of tourists had gathered for vacations. A 57-year-old man was hospitalised with a fever and tested positive. His condition worsened and he was put on a ventilator. Then health workers found three other infections in Da Nang over the weekend. And then on Monday, another 11. All of those were other patients or health workers at the Da Nang Hospital, where the man remains in critical condition. On Monday, authorities encouraged 80,000 tourists to leave the city by providing extra flights. Hotels emptied out and thousands cancelled their plans to visit. Then on Tuesday, the city was put into lockdown. Just how the virus crept back remains a mystery. Authorities say they think the source was from outside Vietnam because this time the virus is a different strain. “One big difference I’ve noticed between this wave and the previous one is that the cases we have right now, a lot of them are severe,” said Marc Choisy, a bio-mathematician.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/after-99-days-of-success-virus-returns-to-haunt-vietnam/article32235538.ece

31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||Getting ahead of constitutional practices||The Rajasthan High Court’s order of July 24 staying the anti-defection proceedings initiated by the Assembly Speaker against the rebel Congress legislators raises important constitutional issues. A simple petition challenging the issuance of notices by the Speaker to the rebel MLAs was turned into a very complex one challenging the constitutionality of Para 2(1)(a) of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution (anti-defection law). The lawyers brought in by the rebels brought big issues before the court which were not very relevant to decide this matter. Staying the Speaker’s action The simple plea initially brought before the court by the rebels was that the notice issued by the Speaker was bad in law and should be quashed. To answer this question, one should take a look at the rules framed under the Tenth Schedule. In the context of a challenge to the notice, only those rules which deal with the notice are relevant for this discussion. These rules were first framed by the Lok Sabha Speaker in 1985 and adopted by more or less all the State Legislatures. Rule 6 of the Lok Sabha rules deals with the filing of the petition and the forwarding of the same by the Speaker to the member concerned and related matters. Rule 6 (4) says that before making a petition seeking the disqualification of a member, the petitioner shall satisfy himself that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the member concerned has become subject to disqualification. Thus, the rule requires the petitioner, and not the Speaker, to satisfy himself about the reasonableness of the ground for disqualification. This responsibility is discharged by the petitioner by appending a brief statement to the petition stating clearly that he has so satisfied himself. Rule 7 says that on receipt of the petition, the Speaker shall consider whether the petition complies with the requirements of Rule 6. If he finds that the petition does not meet all the requirements, he shall dismiss it. If it complies with all the requirements, he shall forward the copy of the petition and the annexure to the member concerned and require him to submit his comments within seven days of the receipt of the copy of the petition. This is the so-called show cause notice which has been challenged. The rules do not mention any show cause notice.  The Speaker cannot go into the reasonableness of the grounds cited in the petition at this stage because the comments of the respondent, evidence he may submit etc., are not before him. Only through a proper hearing will the Speaker be able to know whether reasonable grounds exist for disqualification. It is thus beyond my imagination how a challenge can be brought against a ‘notice’ at this stage. It can thus be concluded that the Speaker’s act of forwarding the petition cannot be legally challenged as he is acting in accordance with the rules. This point does not seem to have received any attention from the court as otherwise the petition would have been dismissed at the threshold.  InKihoto Hollohan v. Zachillhu (1992), while barring any interlocutory intervention by the court in the Tenth Schedule proceedings, the Supreme Court held that a challenge is not barred if there is an imminent threat of disqualification/ suspension before the Speaker takes a final decision. In the Tenth Schedule proceedings, there is no disqualification/ suspension of a member in the interim period. Therefore, the exception mentioned by the court does not become applicable here. Staying the Speaker’s action is unprecedented at the ‘notice’ stage. It will stymie the operation of the Tenth Schedule because any member can go to court and obtain a stay and put a stop to the proceedings — more so when the court has allowed all the larger issues such as the vires of para 2(1)(a) of the Tenth Schedule to be tagged together, which will take months to be heard and adjudicated upon. It is also puzzling how a High Court can reopen a constitutional issue that was settled long ago by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court. Date of the Assembly session The second part of the political drama, about the date of the Assembly session, has just ended, with the Cabinet yielding to the Governor’s demand that there should be a 21-day gap between the summoning and commencement of the session. Although the government has averted an ugly situation by agreeing to the proposal made by the Governor with regard to the date of the session, it has opened the way to future confrontations between elected State governments and Governors. Summoning the Assembly is a routine constitutional function of the Governor. That this has created a serious confrontation resulting in a constitutional deadlock underscores the need to comprehend the ferocity of adversarial politics and its potential to disrupt normal politico-constitutional operations in the field of governance. As per the normal procedure, once the Cabinet decides to call the session on a particular date, that decision is conveyed to the Governor who signs the summons order and sends it back the same day or the next day. Thereafter, the summons is issued to individual members by the Assembly Secretary. By not agreeing to the date decided by the Cabinet, the Governor has shown that he has the final say. This is fraught with many disturbing possibilities in the relationship between the Governor and the State government. Under Article 174 of the Constitution, the Governor summons the Assembly. But the Governor can act only on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The Cabinet form of government presupposes that the executive power of the state vests in the elected government headed by the Chief Minister. The Governor does not exercise any of the executive powers except where the Constitution assigns him certain functions to be performed in his discretion. Calling the session of the Assembly is a part of the executive functions of the government and the Governor can summon the Assembly only on the advice of the Cabinet. In Nabam Rebia and Bamang Felix v. Deputy Speaker (2016), the Supreme Court reaffirmed this position. The crucial question in Rajasthan is whether the Governor has any discretionary power in the matter of summoning the Assembly. The Governor asked the government to change the date of commencement recommended by the Cabinet and proposed a date after 21 days. Finally, he got the Cabinet to yield to his wishes. The Nabam Rebia case makes it clear that so long as the Chief Minister enjoys majority support in the Assembly, the Governor has no discretional powers and is bound to accept the decisions of the Cabinet in regard to the date of commencement of the session. The decision to convene the Assembly session is taken by the Cabinet; the Governor has to merely sign the summons order. Further, the Governor has no role in the conduct of the business of the House, which is done under the control and supervision of the Speaker. Therefore, it is not open to the Governor to ask the government to clarify whether it wants to bring a confidence motion in the House. And what if the Governor does not sign the summons? This question cannot arise where the Constitution and the rule of law are in force. In Shamsher Singh v. State of Punjab (1974), the Supreme Court said: “The Governor has no right to refuse to act on the advice of the Council of Ministries. Such a position is antithetical to the concept of ‘responsible government’.” The Governor and the Chief Minister should be able to resolve such crisis without damaging the integrity of institutions. The 21-day period The last point is about the significance of the 21-day period suggested by the Governor. The Constitution does not provide for this. In 1969, the Rules Committee of the Lok Sabha recommended that the gap between the date of summons and of the commencement of the House should be 21 days. This was thought of as necessary as the collection, collation and scrutiny of information relating to Questions, at different levels of bureaucracy, before it was placed in the House, was a time-consuming job. Although Parliament changed it to 15 days later, many State Legislatures continue with the 21-day period. It is not an inflexible rule, and says “unless the Speaker otherwise decides”. This rule is generally followed but it has never constrained governments from convening the House at shorter notice. In fact, the Rajasthan House rule itself provides for a session at shorter notice. If the government feels the urgency, it is well within its power to convene the House at shorter notice. These are well-established constitutional principles and practices. If a Governor overrules the decision of the Cabinet with regard to even the date of convening the Assembly, and a politically helpless government yields, it becomes a precedent, but not an inspiring one. Society needs to debate this seriously. We must know that politics has a way of getting ahead of principles and practices, and establishing its own norms. If our lofty constitutional principles and practices do no longer excite the citizens, but new political norms do, then democracy is in trouble. P.D.T.

31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||Should the government go easy on the telecom sector?||Following years of breathtaking subscriber growth, tele-density is showing signs of strain. Some telecom players are facing an existential crisis due to brutal competition and the government demanding unpaid dues. At the same time, investors of different hues are lining up to invest in the space, signalling a belief that the industry still holds prospects of juicy returns. In a conversation moderated by K. Bharat Kumar , B.K. Syngal and V. Sridhar discuss what lies in store for the industry. Edited excerpts:  Consumer demand has recently been impacted. Is that affecting the subscriber base as well, as we see tele-density slipping? B.K. Syngal (BKS):Tele-density has been increasing since the early 2000s. The trigger point was in 1999 when we moved away from upfront licence fee payments to a pay-as-you-go regime. In the lower rung of consumers, movement is higher as well as temperamental. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) itself admitted at one point that the actual numbers are 30% lower than the numbers being bandied about. So, I am not unduly worried. This could be a COVID-19 effect where mass movement of migrant labour and joblessness could have resulted in surrendered SIM cards. V. Sridhar (VS):What worries me is not so much the urban tele-density, but the mobile broadband reach. Recent statistics show we have 656 million mobile broadband subscribers and too few — about 19 million — fixed broadband subscribers. The good news in mobile broadband is that over one year, it has risen by about 200 million to reach here. But we still have a lot of ground to cover. The second worrying aspect is fixed broadband. We have about 35 million fixed line subscribers, and only 19 million broadband subscribers. Especially when we are moving towards work from home, long-distance education, tele-medicine and the like being dependent on connectivity, we need a reliable fixed line broadband network. Will the imbroglio over adjusted gross revenues shake the industry’s foundations? BKS:The government is demanding penal interest from telecom operators which, in a way, defines them as wilful defaulters. They are not wilful defaulters. That is one big flaw in the AGR [adjusted gross revenue] imbroglio. The second big flaw is that the case has been going on for the last 15-16 years. And the government has merrily calculated interest on the basis of the number of years, at some LIBOR plus 2% or something like that. Now, how on earth is the industry to be blamed for the delay? The delay has been from both sides. The industry went to court and had a favourable judgment from TDSAT, which was very clear that you cannot have AGR included for non-telecom services. The government decided to go against that judgment to the Supreme Court. That dragged on and on. Finally, last year, this judgment came out of the Supreme Court. Of course, the entire saga is predicated on the faulty definition of AGR accepted by industry while migrating from a fixed licence fee to the variable license fee regime. Little did the industry realise the consequences of that hasty acceptance. Here’s another interesting angle: Justice Bobde, in the Devas case, asked Devas, ‘Why don’t you waive off the interest because our liability is increasing every day?’ Now, why can’t the same principle be applied to this case too? To get out of this stalemate, a bold executive decision on the lines of 1999 is needed. VS:AGR comprises the regulatory fees that are broadly categorised into two areas. One is the licence fee which is 5% universal service obligation fee (USOF) plus 3% as licence fee. So that is 8%. Second comes the spectrum usage charges that range from 1% for 2,300 MHz up to 7-8%. This is huge. We are talking probably about 15% of the AGR as regulatory fees for the government. This is a flawed policy. In any country, the licence fee is not more than 3%, including the USOF. There is no reason why the government should levy a spectrum usage when the spectrum is auctioned. In the last auction in 2016, telcos coughed up Rs. 60,000 crore on buying spectrum. Spectrum is not something that will deteriorate. It doesn’t have depreciation or management costs associated with it. Now, the Supreme Court has just gone by the executive order, which says that this is the adjusted gross revenue due from these companies, and therefore, they have to pay that. The only thing that can be done is for the Department of Telecommunication to take a decision on cancelling or revising the AGR due, excluding the penalty. Both the government and industry have said they would not come back with a recalculation. Are we setting ourselves up for a 2- or 3-player market? VS:If this pulls on, Vodafone UK may not continue to infuse capital into the Indian company. That means we are looking at three operators now. The world over, even in the U.S., in specific areas, there are only three or four operators. That is not really bad as long as the three are equipped to compete. Right now, we are looking at a monopoly emerging in Indian telecom. That will not be good for the consumer. BKS:There are other issues here: we are taxing the industry’s success in perpetuity at 33%;There are cases worldwide; for example, Ofcom, the U.K.’s communications regulator, told the government that industry just couldn’t be in a mode of paying windfall profits all the time. The industry here should ask the government for revenue neutralisation. The average revenue per user (ARPU) will have to go up if the industry’s health has to improve. But can it? VS:According to the ITU’s ICT price basket study, India is ranked 49th in the mobile broadband data plans. So, for about 1.5 GB per month on our average data plan, ARPU is at about $4.75 per month, adjusted for purchasing power parity. The world average, according to the GSM database, is about $8.45. We are very low compared to the international average. The ARPU has to go up. Here’s how it could: ARPU can go up based on the content generated or by creating a larger ecosystem, with operators playing the role of not just connectivity and bandwidth providers, but also as solution providers. Telcos can actually tie up with businesses especially in 5G and IoT. BKS:Data usage per subscriber per month has grown 43 times in the last three years. In September 2016, it was 0.235 GB per subscriber per month; now it is close to 10 GB. There is what I call tariff rebalancing, that is, how to tariff the data vis-a-vis voice — that needs to be looked into. Tariffing of data is still not being properly carried out. There should be reasonable numbers for data charging. Today, about 60% or so of the long distance calls, whether internal or external, are running on Internet or broadband connectivity. People are hardly making any switch calls. Let there be studies as to how much of revenue has migrated away. The regulator should then look into the tariffs for both data and voice. There are still a large number of customers who use basic voice service. So, there has to be a tariff for voice as well. So, look at the tariff and stop this obnoxious, ‘free this, free that’ trend. When Jio came into play and gave some one year of some free services, etc., TRAI should have intervened at that stage saying that the operator ‘was not doing anyone a favour’. The cellular industry got seriously bruised as a result of that laxity by authorities. Given the financial state of some players, is the industry even ready for 5G auctions? VS:5G is not about connectivity and high speed only; it is about creating an ecosystem. For example, in the case of healthcare, it is an ecosystem that would comprise telecom operators, healthcare providers, hospitals, governments, system integrators that provide Internet of Things and machine-to-machine communication. We need to have spectrum so that high bandwidth-intensive applications can be provided to end users. India is poor in allocating spectrum. There are specific spectrum bands which have been pending auction for a while now due to various reasons. We don’t have enough spectrum for operators despite the consolidation that has taken place. As to affordability, the auction methodology we use is appropriate. But what is wrong is the setting up of the reserve price. They have always set the reserve price based upon the winning bid price of the previous auction, which is never done in any other country. A very high price puts off operators. The 700 MHz spectrum, which went unsold in 2016, has remained vacant for the last four years. What have we got? With a lower reserve price, at least that could have been used. I advocate actually starting with a zero reserve price. BKS:The latest count on 5G consumers is something like 100 million worldwide, and 80% of those are in China. Then, there are three technologies today: Huawei-ZTE’s, Nokia’s and Ericsson’s. They are in the process of being standardised. It is the Europeans versus the Chinese. Now with the sanctions, industry is also waiting and watching, as to which technology to choose. They have limited choice, but want technology that is interoperable. Interoperability between networks is a priority. So, operators are asking, ‘why should we be the guinea pigs’? Further, 5G is a bandwidth that has to be used by consumers and consumers must have devices to use that bandwidth. There is also this debate using E and V bands for dense urban areas. Has anyone discussed health concerns, obstructions and complications? For example, Israel has not adopted the E and V bands yet, because they say there are health hazards. We have to get out of this euphoria and look at practical issues. There is also a debate about the mix of fibre and Wi-Fi hotspots. I believe in applying technology to reach out to the masses. Let’s not be hung up on 5G technology to provide bandwidths upwards of 100 Mbps. Have no doubt that higher bandwidths are needed, but how to deliver those most effectively and timely, is the question. I have an upgradeable FTTH delivering me 100 Mbps plus; is not that 5G? I think we should wait on 5G auctions, not rush into it. We should educate the government. What gives global tech majors the confidence to invest in India, albeit so far in one player, Reliance Jio? VS:Previously, the likes of AT&T or Telstra or Etisalat, would pick up stakes in telecom companies as FDI. Today, it is Facebook, Google and other Internet firms that are putting in money. Why? Because the value proposition is more on the content, and applications are abundant. India’s 650 million mobile broadband subscriber base is a huge potential base for any Internet firm to tap into. So I won’t be surprised if for example, Amazon is interested in picking up a stake in Airtel. Because it will include the synergic operation of e-commerce along with this digital cloud offering as well as connectivity.  5G is not just about connectivity and high speed; it is also about creating an ecosystem V.

31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||An education policy that is sweeping in its vision||In approving the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 on July 29, the Union Cabinet has taken an important step forward in India’s transition from deprivation to development. It marks the fourth major policy initiative in education since Independence. The last one was undertaken a good 34 years ago and modified in 1992. Given our current demographic profile, the stage of development we are in, and the aspirations of our youth, the new policy has not come a day too soon. Sweeping in vision Based on two committee reports  and extensive nationwide consultations, NEP 2020 is sweeping in its vision and seeks to address the entire gamut of education from preschool to doctoral studies, and from professional degrees to vocational training. It acknowledges the 21st century need for mobility, flexibility, alternate pathways to learning, and self-actualisation. India has faced unprecedented challenges in providing quality education to children and the youth. Lack of resources and capacity, dozens of mother tongues, a link language that despite being the global language of choice is alien to most, and a persistent mismatch between the knowledge and skills imparted and the jobs available have been some of the challenges that have bedeviled our efforts since Independence. The 2020 policy attempts to break free from the shackles of the past. In adopting a 5+3+3+4 model for school education starting at age 3, it recognises the primacy of the formative years from ages 3 to 8 in shaping the child’s future. It also recognises the importance of learning in the child’s mother tongue till at least Class 5. Here, we are up against the strong desire of parents today, born of pragmatism, to give a head start to their children by exposing them to English from day one. Maybe we should recognise that between ages 3 and 8, picking up languages is child’s play, and blend the mother tongue and English in the first five years of school. Multilingual felicity could become the USP of the educated Indian. Another key aspect of school education in the new policy is the breaking of the straitjackets of arts, commerce and science streams in high school, and the laudable goal of introducing vocational courses with internship. How exactly this will be realised is to be worked out, given the penchant of overzealous parents to “stream” their children into professions at the earliest. The ‘blue-collarisation’ of vocations in our society is also a hurdle to be overcome, but this need not deter us from recognising the merits of the proposed policy. Needless to say, the policy envisages 100% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in school education by 2030. In keeping with the philosophy of flexibility in enabling our students to deviate from the straight and narrow, NEP 2020 proposes a multi-disciplinary higher education framework with portable credits, and multiple exits with certificates, diplomas and degrees. An ambitious GER of 50% is envisaged by 2035. At the apex will be Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities, where research will be supported by a new National Research Foundation. The role of our colleges in attaining the ambitious GER target is recognised by empowering them as autonomous degree-granting institutions, and phasing out the affiliated college, a unique Indian beast that is neither fish nor fowl. The huge potential of online pedagogy and learning methodologies for attaining the GER target is recognised and sought to be tapped extensively. The question of regulation Regulatory cholesterol is the bane of governance in India, with poor outcomes to boot. NEP 2020 makes a bold prescription to free our schools, colleges and universities from periodic “inspections” and place them on the path of self-assessment and voluntary declaration. Transparency, maintaining quality standards and a favourable public perception will become a 24X7 pursuit for the institutions, leading to all-round improvement in their standard. A single, lean body with four verticals for standards-setting, funding, accreditation and regulation is proposed to provide “light but tight” oversight. In a country still beset by huge inequality and challenges faced by the disadvantaged and disabled, the NEP lays particular emphasis on providing adequate support to ensure that no child is deprived of education, and every challenged child is provided the special support she needs. The long-neglected ancient Indian languages and Indic knowledge systems are also identified for immediate attention. All this requires enormous resources. An ambitious target of public spending at 6% of GDP has been set. This is certainly a tall order, given the current tax-to-GDP ratio and competing claims on the national exchequer of healthcare, national security and other key sectors. However, resources are never the main roadblock to success in education. If public and political will can be mustered, resources will find their way from both public and private sources. NEP 2020 provides the ingredients and the right recipe. What we make of it depends entirely on us.

31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||Not the right time to open gyms||At a time when the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in India is over 1.6 million and the daily growth of cases continues to remain high, the Ministry of Home Affairs on July 29 permitted yoga institutes and gymnasiums in areas outside the containment areas to function from August 5. This, even while other enclosed settings such as cinema halls, bars, auditoriums and assembly halls have been ordered to remain shut. There is wide agreement that regular moderate intensity exercise is beneficial for immunity. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 30 minutes per day of physical exercise for healthy adults. But, beginning with the cruise ship Diamond Princess and clusters that had their origin in churches in South Korea and Singapore, it has been known that prolonged exposure in closed spaces with poor ventilation facilitates the virus’s spread. The spread becomes even more pronounced if such places are crowded. Transmission through aerosols The WHO recently acknowledged that transmission of the virus through aerosols “cannot be ruled” out in “certain closed settings that are crowded, and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected persons spend long periods of time with others”. In addition to being closed spaces with poor ventilation, gymnasiums have another critical factor that will actively facilitate virus spread — deep breathing and exhalation through the mouth by members. The number of droplets and aerosols emitted during huffing and puffing will certainly be manifold higher. While deep breathing is likely to take the tiny droplets and aerosols containing the virus deep inside the lungs, leading to infection, exhalation with force will eject more virus particles into the air and make it travel a long distance. Given the breathing pattern of people exercising, poor ventilation would mean that the amount of virus present in the room continues to increase with time. People visiting a gymnasium spend at least 30-60 minutes exercising, thus increasing the risk of infection. Cases investigated between January 15 and April 4 in Japan found that many of the COVID-19 clusters were associated with “heavy breathing in close proximity, such as singing at karaoke parties, cheering at clubs, having conversations in bars, and exercising in gymnasiums”. In mid-February, in Cheonan city in South Korea, 112 persons who participated in fitness dance (Zumba) classes involving high aerobic intensity at 12 sports facilities were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In a report in the journal Emerging Infectious Disease , the researchers said: “Intense physical exercise in densely populated sports facilities could increase risk for infection. Vigorous exercise in confined spaces should be minimised during outbreaks.” Another route of spread is through shiny surfaces contaminated with viruses. Since contact with objects of regular use such as dumb bells, weights is inevitable in gyms, chances of virus spread is high. Investigation in South Korea revealed that unlike the high-intensity Zumba dance classes, pilates (a form of low-impact exercise) and yoga “did not cause the same transmission effects”. However, it is not clear if certain yoga asana s that involve deep breathing and exhalation will increase the risk of infection. Maintaining distancing One way to limit the risk of virus spread is by limiting the number of patrons who can use the gymnasium at any point of time, maintaining physical distancing, vastly improving ventilation, and through regular and periodic cleaning of all equipment. Care also needs to be taken to change masks the moment they get wet. In recent weeks, the virus has spread from large cities to tier-2, tier-3 cities and towns, and its spread is also being observed in areas even outside the containment zones in large cities, as the sero surveys in Delhi, Ahmedabad and Mumbai have revealed. Hence, during the course of the pandemic, it would be prudent to exercise in the open by maintaining physical distancing. prasad.ravindranath@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/not-the-right-time-to-open-gyms/article32235536.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||A long road||The National Education Policy 2020 announced by the Ministry of Human Resource Development sets for itself the goal of transforming the system to meet the needs of 21st Century India. In a federal system, any educational reform can be implemented only with support from the States, and the Centre has the giant task of building a consensus on the many ambitious plans. The policy, inter alia, aims to eliminate problems of pedagogy, structural inequities, access asymmetries and rampant commercialisation. The NEP 2020 is the first omnibus policy after the one issued in 1986, and it has to contend with multiple crises in the system. It is no secret that primary schools record shockingly poor literacy and numeracy outcomes, dropout levels in middle and secondary schools are significant, and the higher education system has generally failed to meet the aspirations for multi-disciplinary programmes. In structural terms, the NEP’s measures to introduce early childhood education from age 3, offer school board examinations twice a year to help improve performance, move away from rote learning, raise mathematical skills for everyone, shift to a four-year undergraduate college degree system, and create a Higher Education Commission of India represent major changes. Progress on these crucially depends on the will to spend the promised 6% of GDP as public expenditure on education. The policy also says that wherever possible, the medium of instruction in schools until at least Class 5, but preferably until Class 8 and beyond, will be the home language or mother tongue or regional language. This is a long-held view, and has its merits, although in a large and diverse country where mobility is high, the student should have the option to study in the language that enables a transfer nationally. English has performed that role due to historical factors. There are some good elements to the NEP 2020 that will generate little friction, and need only adequate resourcing. Provision of an energy-filled breakfast, in addition to the nutritious mid-day meal, to help children achieve better learning outcomes, is one. Creation of ‘inclusion funds’ to help socially and educationally disadvantaged children pursue education is another. Where the policy fails to show rigour, however, is on universalisation of access, both in schools and higher education; the Right to Education needs specific measures to succeed. Moreover, fee regulations exist in some States even now, but the regulatory process is unable to rein in profiteering in the form of unaccounted donations. The idea of a National Higher Education Regulatory Council as an apex control organisation is bound to be resented by States. Similarly, a national body for aptitude tests would have to convince the States of its merits. Among the many imperatives, the deadline to achieve universal literacy and numeracy by 2025 should be a top priority as a goal that will crucially determine progress at higher levels.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-long-road/article32235523.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||Banking on serology||A recent serology survey that scientists used to estimate the spread of COVID-19 in Mumbai has found that nearly three in five, or 57% of those tested in slums had been exposed to the virus and had developed antibodies against it as compared to only 16% of those tested in residential societies. Results from Delhi’s seroprevalence study, earlier this month, found that nearly a quarter of the 21,000-odd samples tested had been exposed to the virus and some of the densest districts had over 20% prevalence. Of the nearly 7,000 tested in Mumbai, nearly 61% were slum-dwellers and the higher prevalence of the virus there showed that — as expected — those living in the densest urban agglomerations were most likely to have been infected by it. A large proportion of those in whom antibodies were detected — the numbers aren’t known — were asymptomatic and this pointed to the fact that the fatality rate in Mumbai may be “as low as 0.05-0.10 per cent, instead of the existing 5.5 per cent,” as per an estimate accompanying the results of the survey. Such serological surveys are increasingly being used by States. Ahmedabad’s civic body conducted one to conclude that only 17% of the city had been likely exposed to the virus and Tamil Nadu too is in the midst of conducting such a survey. A dominant theme driving State bodies that commission such surveys is to check for levels of ‘herd immunity’, or if 60%-70% of the population have encountered the infection. The argument is that this degree of exposure will, akin to a vaccine, also protect the rest of those uninfected. But given the absence of knowledge about how long antibodies last and the extent to which they protect from fresh infections, herd immunity isn’t a precise science and not something that ought to be pursued by a state as a matter of policy. It is four months since India got its first 100 cases and very early in May, the Indian Council of Medical Research’s survey had shown that the number of those infected by the virus were many multiples of those that were being reflected in official confirmed-case statistics. The unrelenting advance of the virus shows that while it is much less of a killer, in aggregate, than expected, it spares few from infection. Therefore, in the absence of a reliable vaccine, the vast majority of people everywhere — irrespective of peaks and ebbs in daily caseloads — continue to be vulnerable. Serology surveys can at best be crude pointers to chronicle the progress of the pandemic and not a psychological palliative.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/banking-on-serology/article32235526.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||Reporting sans spectators||Sport is about adrenaline rush, stunning reflexes, evergreen champions and nostalgia’s warmth. But it needs historical context and essentially, sport is reality drama that prospers along with an audience. Crowds gift buzz and it is an intangible quality that athletes constantly seek. Sadly in these times of social distancing due to COVID-19, sport has snapped its umbilical cord with a fan base that packs the stands and even enlivens dull passages with impromptu Mexican waves. Recently, Stuart Broad said: “Wish I had family and friends to wave at.” He had just taken 500 Test wickets at Old Trafford fringed by vacant seats! The lone consolation being that his father Chris Broad was present as the match referee. Equally, sports correspondents are resigned to filing their despatches from empty stadiums with just the squads, officials and broadcast crew providing a human dimension. It is not that they aren’t used to this as some domestic tournaments are watched by three men and a dog but international sport always drew the faithful. Journalists are getting used to the tragic normal and earlier times seem like utopia. Back then, there was bone-crushing rush, fans stretched their vocal chords, former players lent mystique and scribes did not crane their necks to find colour and atmosphere. Vibrant press boxes If sport is larger than life, its nuanced perceptions emanate from vibrant press boxes. There are moments when the player, fan and writer find communion and that is when a goal is scored, a six hoisted or a wicket snared. In that fleeting second, the earth stops on its axis and magic finds a second life through the reporter’s hyper-active laptop. The crowd amplifies surrealism, without that it is akin to penning a lyric from a cemetery. The press box always hosts a congregation. Rookie writer, wizened veteran, cricketers-turned-commentators and scorers, and there is always hugs, banter and high fives. Reporters also seek their jostling spaces for what gives them a high – be it caffeine or nicotine. A legend like Sunil Gavaskar could regale you with his anecdotes from the West Indies, a Michael Holding might speak with deep insight about sport as a metaphor and draw West Asia or race into it while a Sanjay Manjrekar can talk technique and belt out an old Hindi song. This bouquet of experiences needs to be savoured. All that has come to a halt inside media enclosures and another loss is the acoustic clues that spectators offer. Often in late-night matches, the correspondent has one eye on his report and another on the ground. If he or she misses a beat, the crowd’s roar prompts a quick look at the television as there is a time-lapse between live action and its corresponding telecast. Thankfully that big hit or sizzling forehand is seen and the observation merges into frenetic prose. Even bland press conferences acquired a life. There are takeaways too like when Sachin Tendulkar went on the charm offensive, grinned and asked: “So you guys are going to ask a few questions?” That personal touch is lost as sport grapples with sweaty kinetics on the turf and silence off it. The sports correspondent too is looking beyond the ball and awaiting a vaccine because reporting from venues bereft of fans, is a punch in the gut.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/reporting-sans-spectators/article32235535.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||West Bengal assembly dissolved||The West Bengal Governor, Mr. S. S. Dhavan, to-day [July 30] dissolved the State Assembly setting at rest all speculations about formation of an alternative ministry in the State. The announcement was immediately welcomed by all major parties. Some of the parties, including the two Communist parties and the Forward Bloc, also demanded an early announcement of the date of mid-term poll in the State. The Assembly was suspended on March 19, when President’s rule was imposed following the Chief Minister Mr. Ajoy Mukherjee’s resignation on March 16. A Raj Bhavan communique issued this evening, said, “The Governor of West Bengal, by his order dated 30-7-70, has been pleased to dissolve the West Bengal Legislative Assembly with immediate effect.” Mr. Dhavan had earlier sent a communication to the Union Government stating that it did not seem possible that a stable government could be formed in West Bengal. In view of this, it was recommended that the State Assembly should be dissolved. He, accordingly, dissolved the Assembly. Since the promulgation of the President’s rule, the erstwhile constituents of the second United Front broke into groups, one headed by the Communist Party of India and the other led by the Communist Party (Marxist), with the Bangla Congress ploughing a lone furrow.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/west-bengal-assembly-dissolved/article32235534.ece
31 July 2020||Southampton,||Ireland restricted to 172||David Willey marked his return to England duty with a maiden five-wicket One-Day international haul after sparking an Ireland collapse as white-ball cricket resumed on Thursday. The left-arm paceman, left out of England’s World Cup-winning squad, responded by taking five for 30 from 8.4 overs as Ireland was dismissed for just 172 in the first of a three-match series that launches the new World Cup Super League to determine qualification for the 2023 50-over showpiece in India. Willey took four early wickets as the visitors slumped to 28 for five after losing the toss. But Curtis Campher held firm with an unbeaten 59 on debut and with Andy McBrine (40) shared a stand of 66 after Ireland was in danger of being dismissed for under 100 at 79 for seven.

31 July 2020||Chennai,||TNPL’s 2020 edition likely to be cancelled||With the latest government order from the Centre prohibiting sporting events in August, the Tamil Nadu Premier League’s last hope of running the fifth edition has all but ended. The TNPL was originally supposed to have been held between June 10 and July 12 before it was postponed because of the COVID-19 outbreak. The Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) was hoping to reschedule it in August-September. But with August now out of the equation and the IPL set to start in September, there is no window in the domestic calendar to fit it in. With a curtailed domestic season set to begin after the IPL, a formal announcement regarding the cancellation of the 2020 TNPL edition is now imminent.  “We were hoping to get some relaxation after July, but now that no sporting events are allowed for another month, the window seems to have closed,” said a senior TNCA official. “It is unfortunate, especially considering we now have floodlights ready at Salem and Coimbatore as well which takes the total number of grounds with lights to five in the State,” the official added. Nets at Chepauk With athletes competing at the national and international level allowed to train in the State, the TNCA is hoping it can provide net practice facilities for State players at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium from next week. The association is also hoping to find a way to complete the remaining league matches at least in September, with only three games (two semifinals and a final) left in the first division.

31 July 2020||Kolkata,||Lockdown, Amphan render girls vulnerable in Bengal||Over the past few months, people vulnerable to trafficking and survivors of the organised crime in parts of West Bengal have had to grapple with the challenges of lockdown due to COVID-19 and the devastation caused by cyclone Amphan. The districts of South 24 and North 24 Parganas, which have taken the battering of the cyclone, are hotspots of trafficking. Anticipating an increase in child marriages and trafficking in the aftermath of cyclone Amphan, the Commission for Protection of Child Rights (WBCPCR) had come up with a dedicated helpline and a desk to deal with the issue as early as June. “We have received at least 10 incidents of children missing in the South 24 Parganas. Most of the girls are minors,” Subhasree Raptan, a representative of the Goranbose Gram Bikash Kendra (GGBK), an organisation working in the district. Ms. Raptan said some girls, reported to have travelled to other States, have actually been trafficked to other areas of the same district. There are also reports of an increase in child marriages. A representative of the Child Line that operates a helpline said that between April and July, at least 30 complaints were reported. Sambhu Nanda, who works for the Partners for Anti-Trafficking (PAT), a collective of eight community-based organisations, said a similar number of complaints of child marriages has come to fore in the North 24 Parganas district also. “In some cases, the volunteers were able to prevent the marriages but in other cases, they could not.” Another challenge is the paucity of legal aid to victims who have been rescued from different parts of the country. The girls have little access to legal protection due to the pandemic. “In some cases the accused are getting bail and in several others, compensation for the survivors is getting stalled because of the pandemic,” Ms. Raptan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/lockdown-amphan-render-girls-vulnerable-in-bengal/article32235691.ece
31 July 2020||HYDERABAD,||Blessing in disguise for Harsha||Some blessings come in disguise. The lockdown is one such for 20-year-old GM Harsha Bharathakoti. For it has given him the opportunity to interact with three-time World championship bronze medallist GM Dronavalli Harika. Online only Harsha, now training online and participating only in online tournaments, says it is a joy to work with Harika Akka . “She is such a class player, I am sure I will be a much better player after these interactive sessions with someone who is preparing for the next Olympiad,” he said in a chat with The Hindu . “She talks about the intensity of competition and the high standards of the game at higher levels. She also talks about how to mentally prepare and stay focused for the challenges,” said Harsha, the 2019 International Memorial of Irena Warakomsa champion. Harika feels Harsha has the talent and is hard-working but lacks international exposure. Trained by N.V.S. Ramaraju (Harika’s first coach), Harsha’s biggest challenge in online training is staying in touch with the classical format. Right balance “I have to strike the right balance between online competition and classical format. The huge advantage of online games is that we don’t feel psychological pressure at all. But, if we overdo that and not train properly in the classical format, we might struggle once international competition returns,” said the first year B.Com student of Spoorthi College. Breaking into the ELO 2700 elite group (present rating 2509) is his priority now. “It is a long way to go, but I am putting in the required efforts,” he said.

31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||Srihari rues time lost in lockdown||If things had gone well, Srihari Nataraj would have now been in Tokyo, competing with the world’s best swimmers. While COVID-19 forced the postponement of the Olympics, the Indian government’s continued prohibition of swimming activities — gyms have been allowed to open but not pools — has meant that the country’s best swimmers haven’t so much as wet their feet since late March. “I am at a loss for words. A break for a month or two is understandable, but pretty much everyone around the world has started training but us,” Srihari told The Hindu . “The amount of progress we could have made in these months…. we have lost it all. There is still time for the Olympics, but we can’t swim for a month and expect to do well. We need to start now.”  Swimming careers are notoriously short — the late teens and early 20s are considered peak years. Srihari is 19 and, after a record-breaking season last year, remains the nation’s best bet to achieve the elusive A-mark Olympic Qualifying Time. In 100m backstroke, he is 0.84s off the A-mark (53.85s). “I expected a lot of drop in my timings in the last six months,” he said. “Now it is going to take me another four to five months to make up for it. And from now till the next guidelines come out in September, I will waste one more month of my career waiting.” During the lockdown, Srihari has occupied himself with fitness drills with some gym equipment. But it’s the feel of water he is desperate for. “I have had some of my best races when I have done very little gym work. I know of people who can lift a lot more than me but cannot use that strength in water. So regardless of the gym time, if I don't get two sessions a day in the pool, it's not of much use. The feel of the water matters more than the strength.” Travel abroad Going abroad to train was something he thought about too. “I tried contacting my friend Tarun who travelled to Sydney in Australia and has started training. The federation (SFI) is also looking at a few places, but nothing is final yet. “I try to not bother about the negative stuff, but I do think about the months lost. Right now I am supposed to be in Tokyo and I am not. That’s definitely a disappointment.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/srihari-rues-time-lost-in-lockdown/article32235710.ece
31 July 2020||KOZHIKODE,||Nothing like playing chess over the board, says Harikrishna||Talking over phone from Prague, P. Harikrishna sounded cheerful on Thursday evening. He had reasons to be happy; he finally was able to play in a chess tournament after a gap of five months. The Biel International Chess Festival, which concluded in Switzerland on Wednesday, was the first major chess tournament after the coronavirus crisis impacted the world. Harikrishna did rather well, too. He won the titles in the classical and Chess960 events and finished runner-up overall, by just half-a-point.  “It was a great feeling to be back in a tournament hall after five months,” the World No. 26 told The Hindu . “Though I have been playing quite a bit of online chess like everybody else, there is nothing like sitting in front of a chessboard, facing your rival.” But the conditions were a lot different in Biel as the COVID-19 guidelines had to be followed. “The organisers were very careful and implemented all the precautions prescribed by the doctors,” Harikrishna said. “The players were separated by a plexiglass; I could get used to it pretty quickly.” No shaking hands The players also had to get used to the practice of not shaking hands. Normally, a game of chess would begin and end with a handshake. “Michael Adams had extended his hand when he decided to concede a game to me, but both of us remembered that we were not supposed to do that,” Harikrishna smiled. “The board and the chess pieces were frequently disinfected and there were separate doors to enter and exit the venue.” Though there were only eight players in the main event, some 150 took part in the open tournament. “A distance of 1.5m was maintained between the players,” he said. “For the blitz event, there was no plexiglass, so we had to wear masks.” Harikrishna feels the organisers could take credit for organising such a big event when very few people were willing to. “No one would have blamed them if they didn’t conduct this tournament,” he said. “Fortunately, everything went off well.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nothing-like-playing-chess-over-the-board-says-harikrishna/article32235693.ece
31 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||Anand finishes ninth||Viswanathan Anand signed off his dismal campaign in the chess24 Legends of Chess with a 2-3 loss to fellow veteran Vassily Ivanchuk in the ninth and final round on Wednesday. All five games, including the tie-breaker Armageddon game, ended as draws. Since Anand played Armageddon with white pieces, with a minute more on the clock, the winning point went to Ivanchuk. Overall, this was Anand’s fourth loss in Armageddon in as many appearances. Eight defeats in nine rounds pushed Anand to the ninth spot in the league standings, ahead of Hungary’s Peter Leko. Magnus Carlsen posted his ninth successive win after dominating Vladimir Kramnik 3-1 and topped the league table. Kramnik needed to beat Carlsen to claim a semifinal spot, provided Anish Giri defeated Peter Svidler. Giri did win 2.5-1.5 but a desperate Kramnik lost the third and fourth rapid games to slip to the sixth spot, one behind Ivanchuk. Kramnik’s defeat cleared the way for Svidler to the semifinals. In the best-of-three set semifinals, beginning on Friday, Carlsen faces Svidler while Ian Nepomniachtchi plays Anish Giri.  The results (ninth round): Vassily Ivanchuk (Ukr) bt Viswanathan Anand 3-2; Magnus Carlsen (Nor) bt Vladimir Kramnik (Rus) 3-1; Boris Gelfand (Isr) bt Ian Nepomniachtchi (Rus) 3-2; Anish Giri (Ned) bt Peter Svidler (Rus) 2.5-1.5; Ding Liren (Chn) bt Peter Leko (Hun) 2.5-1.5.

31 July 2020||BIRMINGHAM,||Roller-coaster start for Shubhankar Sharma||Indian golfer Shubhankar Sharma began with a flourish, but two slightly wayward tee shots cost him dear as he ended the first day with a roller-coaster one-over 73 in the Hero Open on Thursday. The 24-year-old Indian, who has two wins on the European Tour, had a birdie and an eagle on the second and third holes, but double bogeys on the 10th and 13th on the back stretch saw him drop a bunch of shots. Overall, he had an eagle, three birdies, two bogeys and two double bogeys. Rodriguez in lead Spain’s Sebastian Garcia Rodriguez fired a stunning 62 to hold the clubhouse lead on day one, two stokes ahead of compatriot Pablo Larrazabal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/roller-coaster-start-for-shubhankar-sharma/article32235695.ece

31 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||AFI strict on those leaving camp||The extended waiting period for athletes has been frustrating for many but the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) is not too keen on relaxing the norms citing health and security issues. Those who have left the Sports Authority of India (SAI) centres — in Patiala and Bengaluru — are also likely to face stern action with the AFI making it clear they would not be included in the national camp. Their participation in the scheduled Indian Grand Prix on Sept. 12 is also uncertain. “We are very clear on this. Those who have gone back will not be part of the national camp. They, their state associations and employers have all been informed accordingly,” AFI president Adille Sumariwala told The Hindu . Among those who have gone home and are training on their own are quartermiler Arokia Rajiv, 400m hurdler Jabir MP, javelin thrower Vipin Kasana and race-walker Manish Rawat. Of these, Manish and Jabir had been named in the latest national camp updated this month while Kasana (who returned from South Africa with other throwers) and Rajiv had been training in Patiala since lockdown. “The SOPs are there for a reason. These athletes will not be back in the national camp. As for their participation in IGP or other events, we will decide later,” Sumariwalla reiterated. Asked about Neeraj Chopra, who had also gone home, Sumariwalla said the thrower was already back at the NIS and in quarantine. “It was an urgent family emergency, he explained it to us, left and came back within a couple of days and is isolated right now. That’s different,” he explained.  “We are very clear on this.

31 July 2020||Kochi,||Usha plans a new competition||With a September start to the national athletics season looking unlikely, P.T. Usha has planned a competition within her academy in Kozhikode in August to keep her trainees motivated. “We have some 20 girls and we are planning to have teams of four each and have a competition. We will have events from the 100m to the 800m,” Usha told The Hindu . “Now, it looks like there may not be any competition this year. And if athletes just keep training without a change, their morale may go down. This competition is just to give them a pep up, to make life interesting for them.”  “In the 400m, we have Jisna Mathew, Abitha Mary Manuel, Jessy Joseph and T. Suryamol and we have some good 800m runners too. So, we will try to ensure that the teams are equal to make the competition interesting,” said Usha. The competition at the Usha School of Athletics in Kinalur near Balussery is likely to be held mid-August. “This will be our first such competition. Earlier, we used to have special events for Tintu Luka if she did not get proper exposure before big meets,” said Usha. “We used to conduct a heat, semifinal and final on three different days just to give Tintu a feel of things. Our new event will have teams competing against each other.” Usha’s athletes were among the first in the country to resume training after the coronavirus lockdown. Surrounded by mountains, the academy is a sort of closed centre and has its own synthetic track. And that offers Usha many options to try out new things.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/usha-plans-a-new-competition/article32236011.ece

31 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘54 nations not doing enough to fight slavery’||With Commonwealth countries accounting for about 40% of people living in conditions of modern slavery in the world, the 54 nations were found lacking in actions to eradicate modern slavery by 2030, according to a report released by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) and anti-slavery organisation Walk Free, on Thursday, on the occasion of World Day Against Trafficking in Persons. The report stated that India had fared the worst in terms of coordination, “with no national coordinating body or National Action Plan in place”. “Commonwealth countries have made little progress towards their commitment to eradicate modern slavery by 2030, despite an estimated one in every 150 people in the Commonwealth living in conditions of modern slavery,” CHRI and Walk Free said in a statement. The report found that one-third of the Commonwealth countries had criminalised forced marriage, while 23 had not criminalised commercial sexual exploitation of children.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/54-nations-not-doing-enough-to-fight-slavery/article32235690.ece

31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||Cheers, from across the seas||When Bhagya and Robert Barett met on a blind date at an Irish pub called Tom Collins in Limerick, Ireland, they had no idea that their romance would be encapsulated in a Malayalee-Irish gin, just five years later. “We met in 2015, and by December 2016, Rob popped the question. We were married in Kollam by August 2017,” says Bhagya, adding with a giggle, “It was speed dating by Irish standards.” The couple recently launched Rebel City Distillery in Cork’s historic docklands, in a former Ford factory building. Although the boutique distillery is just a few weeks old, it is already drawing international attention for its first launch, Maharani Gin. “We still have to put up our sign board,” says Bhagya. Robert adds that they currently have just one employee. With Bhagya still working as a senior programme manager at Dell, Robert, who is a biochemist turned fine spirits expert, is handling production, with help from his father, Brendan. Maharani’s intriguing bottle has been doing the rounds on WhatsApp and social media for its clever efforts to encapsulate both their cultures on the label. Using Pantone’s 2020 colour of the year, Classic Blue , the Malayalam lettering includes the word viplava (rebel) spirit, which Bhagya says is a nod to the rebellious history of both Ireland and Kerala. Over a phonecall from Cork, Bhagya — like a freshly poured G&T — is bright and effervescent, while Robert is quiet and endearingly wry. Explaining how she grew up in Kollam, then worked with HCL Technologies and Tata Consultancy Services in Chennai before moving to Madrid for a project, and then Dublin, where she got a job with Dell, Bhagya explains that the couple has strong links with Kerala. She switches excitedly between Malayalam and English as she speaks, punctuating her sentences with bursts of laughter. “We had a wedding on the backwaters in Kollam. It was adipoli .” Robert placidly explains his background, when she pauses. “I’m from Cork originally. I started with Biochemistry, then moved to Edinburgh to do a Master’s in Brewing and Distilling at the Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.” He then worked in Ireland, with Kilbeggan (now Beam) and The Shed Distillery. And in Canada, with Vancouver-based Central City Brewers and Distillers where he set up and established their distillery focussing on whiskey, gin and vodka. “I wanted to start a distillery, and I was talking to Bhagya about gin. She suggested using nut meg, cassia and pomelo from Kerala,” says Robert. “Can I say it?” Bhagya interjects enthusiastically, “There was this chechi next door in Kollam who had the most amazing jathikka (nutmeg) and bamblimas (pomelo) when we were growing up. I also love Kerala’s cassia, it gives a special sweetness.” The right match Scouting around Kerala for farms, the couple discovered Vanamoolika, in Wayanad. Specialising in conservation and organic cultivation of plants, the organisation focusses on empowering women farmers. “We couldn’t think of a better partnership: strong women from my homeland,” says Bhagya. “We want to go back with bottles of Maharani and open the gin with those adipoli chechimaar .” Maharani gin blends nine botanicals, out of which the nutmeg, mace, cassia and pomelo are from Wayanad. The couple plans to source cardamom as well from Kerala soon. Describing the flavour, Robert says “It’s citrus and spice. You can taste the element of juniper, as well as the citrus of pomelo. There is a creamy mouth feel…” Bhagya adds, “And a nice spicy, bright finish. Also that sweetness of cassia. It’s the taste of home.” Unfortunately, COVID-19 has delayed their celebratory trip to India. While the pandemic hampered the launch, Maharani is now being sold online and served in bars in Ireland. “The response has been great so far,” says Robert. “This is the first distillery opening in Cork in 50 years, so we have got encouraging press here. With the pandemic, people are looking for good news.” The couple is keen on retailing in India as well, eventually. In the meantime, Robert is working on their next launch: “An India-inspired rum, made with jaggery”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/cheers-from-across-the-seas/article32236048.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||A love letter to integration||Ever heard of kimchiparathas? Or oat and chickpea cheela s? These are just two of the unusual recipes in London-based restaurateur Ravindar Bhogal’s latest cookbook Jikoni: Proudly Inauthentic Recipes from an Immigrant Kitchen (Bloomsbury). The tagline begs the question: what does she think about authenticity when it comes to food. “Very restrictive,” is her answer over email. “Authenticity is very subjective and, for me, it is only important that one is authentic to oneself. We are all products of differing landscapes and experiences, so it is natural that that is reflected in the food you cook. My grandmother’sdalis always going to be different from your grandmother’s because of their unique life experiences. So to ask which is more authentic seems ludicrous.” In the initial days of her move to England from Kenya as a child, she says “I longed for the familiar and the foods that signified the familiar to me.” Food that immigrants create, she says, comes out of reconciliation of the ache for what they have left behind and the wonder of their new landscape. “It comes out of resourcefulness, the ability to adapt and often economic circumstances. Immigrants preserve their culinary heritage and overlay it with the customs and ingredients of their new nation to create unique cuisines.” Apart from family, she credits being an immigrant as a major influence in her work as a chef. “Trying to find a space to fit into, trying to assimilate into other people’s versions of what it meant to be British was always challenging because I am Indian and East African too. So in a way, opening my restaurant and cooking in the mixed heritage way I do was perhaps a subconscious effort to create a space into which I felt like I belonged.” Her best food memory is “probably eating ice cream at a 1950s ice cream parlour called Sno Cream in Nairobi with my grandfather. It was the feeling of being adored and indulged; the sharing of something naughty but nice with him.” She fondly recalls the seats that “you could spin around on till you were dizzy or until an adult yelled at you to sit still.” The worst was searching for biscuits baked by her mother. “She stored them in large steel canisters that were almost as tall as me. They were airtight so you’d have to really pull at the lids.” Opening the wrong one, Ravindar spilt cooking oil over her new frock. “I knew I was going to be in real trouble so I hid for what seemed like hours!” A salute to women The book features more than just recipes. Anecdotes from growing up in Kenya and England pepper the narrative, emphasising how food connects people and informs one’s identity. Ravindar acknowledges that the book is part memoir. “It tells the story of what it is like to settle into a new place as an immigrant,” she muses, adding, “It also pays tribute to the many women who taught me to cook and moved me. I feel strongly that these women, who had so much impact on how we cook, eat and live, should not be invisible as they often were in their lifetime.” For her book, she chose recipes that were either the most delicious or had a story. Like prawn toast Scotch eggs with banana ketchup. “It takes two perennial favourites — a British Scotch egg and Chinese prawn toast — and brings them together to create something better than the sum of their parts. I think it also makes a political statement about how we cook without borders. Politicians put up borders and cooks have the ability to take them down.”  What’s in a name? Jikoni is not just the title of Ravindar’s book. It is also the name she gave to her London restaurant, for very deliberate reasons. “Jikoni means ‘kitchen’ in Swahili,” says Ravindar, “It is a very simple name, and I wanted it that way. Many guests ask what it means, when they first come to the restaurant. And I tell them, so that they walk away learning a little bit of Swahili, a little bit more about Kenya.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-love-letter-to-integration/article32236052.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||All set for the future||Story so far: Rayu smartly exposes Mr. Som’s sweet-eating habits at a public performance. Mr. Kamal comes home the next morning. “Sister Rosie wants to see you both,” he says.   A whirring noise caught our attention when we reached Sister Rosie’s office. There was no sign of Mrs. Charumathi or Floppy. A man was working on a slab of granite with a drilling machine. Suddenly, Mad Malini appeared. “I loved your performance yesterday,” she said. “I am going to buy you a magician’s kit next time I visit the city.” I couldn’t believe my ears. Sister Rosie called us into her office. “How much money have you collected so far?” she asked, opening the steel almirah in her room. “Three hundred and eighty rupees,” said I. “Four hundred and ninety,” said Rani. “Both of you get ten thousand rupees now. Is that enough to win the gold medals?” she asked, placing two envelopes on the table. “And both of you will get 20 lakhs each to fund your education when you turn 18.” Rani leaned forward. “We would like to thank the person who gave us the money.” “There is no need for it,” said Sister Rosie. “Can we come to Happy Home after school?” I asked. “Yes,” she said. “You can visit Happy Home any time you want. Don’t expect any money for your chores! And don’t buy any sweets for Mr. Som!” I couldn’t wait to tell my parents about the money. But Rani was standing under the mango tree and looking at the man working on the slab of black granite. “Rayu!” she shouted. “She’s dead.” “Who?” I returned to her side. Rani pointed to the granite slab: “In the loving memory of Mrs. Charumathi, 1935-2020.” Floppy was sitting next to a mound in a corner. He lifted his eyes when he saw us but did not move. Mr. Kamal gave him some water. “I wish she would have been around to see the money we received,” said Rani. Mr. Kamal tilted his head and gave a crooked smile. “Didn’t Sister Rosie tell you? It was Mrs. Charumathi who left you the money,” said Mr. Kamal. “She has donated all her money to Happy Home and some orphanages. She loved you both for saving Floppy’s life.” While Rani petted Floppy and cajoled him to eat, I picked some flowers and arranged them around Mrs. Charumathi’s grave. Rani and I returned home, happy and sad. When the school reopened, we had collected the maximum amount. We took our gold medals and showed them to Sister Rosie. Later, we put our medals around Floppy’s neck and took him to Mrs. Charumathi’s grave. If it wasn’t for her, we would never have succeeded in our quest for gold.  The End   Mr. Kamal tilted his head and gave a crooked smile. “Didn’t Sister Rosie tell you?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/all-set-for-the-future/article32236220.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||Sixer in the safari||“What’s that bird with two tails?” asked a little girl in the open safari jeep. “That’s a Greater Racket-tailed Drongo. It imitates other birds’ calls; it’s a talented bird,” explained Nikhil. “Look! Bison to your right…” The jeep went on, and the tourists kept clicking pictures. Nikhil was very good at spotting picture-worthy animals and birds, having grown up around the forest. In a short time, he had become a much in-demand forest guide. But being a forest guide wasn’t easy. The money he earned meant he could take better care of Amma. But it also meant no school, no friends and no cricket. And it was the last that Nikhil missed the most. He had been the best batsman and fielder in his school team, and had played in the district finals. Harbouring dreams of playing for the Indian team, he would spend hours following the sport or practising to catch a ball, bouncing it on any surface he could find. But now, it seemed, it would always remain just a dream, thought Nikhil to himself, as the safari jeep slowed to a stop at the refreshment point near the water hole. Distraction There was chaos at the tea point, with people gathered in a crowd below the machan that was set up. Nikhil followed their gaze and seeing the reason, his eyes lit up. Ankur Bhatia, his favourite cricketer and the most successful captain of the Indian cricket team, was right here — in his forest! Nikhil idolised him. Used to all the attention, Bhatia, wholding a huge camera, was nonchalantly looking at something his guide was showing him. Nikhil was watching from the fringes, in a daze. And then, in a flash, a few men broke the cordon of men standing guard at the bottom of the steps to climb the machan to get close to Bhatia. Rattled by the commotion, Bhatia turned around and the camera slipped from his hands. A gasp sounded as people watched, and involuntarily moved their hands to their mouths. Nikhil ran the length of the ground, leapt like lightning, diving to catch it, and secured it, just an inch above the ground. The applause was as loud as when he had hit the century in the district finals. Someone from the machan shouted their thanks, while the others gathered around him. “Check that he hasn’t broken any bones.” Nikhil looked up to see the Ankur Bhatia bending over him. Nikhil broke into a grin. “Well played, man. That was one of the best dives I have seen in my life, and I must have seen thousands of them. Ever thought of playing cricket? Would you like to join my academy? That’ll be my thanks to you for saving my camera — I have had it forever with me!” Bhatia asked him. Once again, Nikhil leaped in the air, this time out of sheer joy.  Nikhil had put away his dreams of being a cricketer when his luck turned...||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/sixer-in-the-safari/article32236249.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||Evanescent hitchhiker||It had been raining all day. By evening, we were bored and restless. So, my brother and I devised a devilish game and with much laughter and screaming were enjoying ourselves, much to the consternation of our parents. But, as is the wont with all wild games, it soon ended in disaster. My brother fell and hurt his head and began bawling. My father brought the car around and we rushed off to the hospital. The doctor did not find anything seriously wrong with him, but advised that he should spend the night there. So, my mother stayed back, and my father and I went home. The steady drizzle of the evening had given way to thick swirling mist and we could barely see beyond the windscreen. At a particularly dark and lonely stretch of the road, the car, which was old and troublesome, shuddered, spluttered and stopped. A lone figure was silhouetted against the car headlights. As he walked, we saw him hunch up against the cold and hold his umbrella firm as he battled the gusts of wind. Chilling After what seemed an age, my father shut the bonnet and scrambled back into the car. He turned the key in the ignition and the car started. A bone-chilling cold swept into the car. We started off in a hurry to get home to warmth and comfort. The man with the umbrella seemed to have disappeared. “Where could he have gone?” I wondered. There were no houses anywhere close by. With the windows rolled up, the sound of the howling wind was shut out. In the silence of the car, I heard something rustle in the back seat. I mentioned it to my father and he said it was my imagination. We heard an aching, heartfelt sigh. I looked at my father. He was impassive, but he did increase his speed. When my father parked the car in the garage, I surreptitiously looked back and thought I saw a flitting shadow. And, again that long, yearning sigh. I screamed. To assure me that there was indeed nothing there, my father opened the back door and found a puddle of water on the car mat. One similar to that left by a wet umbrella. The next morning, the driver arrived and began to wash the car. He saw the puddle of water. He took out the mats and dried them. Before driving, he replaced the mats. To his utter surprise, the puddle reappeared and he was not too sure, but he thought he heard a sigh. And, it was cold in the car. *** The puddle is always there. No one sits in the back seat now. Actually, we never use the car these days. My father tried to sell it, but the puddle puts off prospective buyers. Oh, and also the bone-chilling coldness inside the car and the constant long, anguished sighs…  I heard something rustle in the back seat. We heard an aching, heartfelt sigh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/evanescent-hitchhiker/article32236254.ece

Bond says, “ A Song of India marks 70 years of my long writing career, which began when I was 16. In these seven decades, I have written hundreds of stories for children and just as many for adults too, and I am still continuing to do so. I am very fortunate to have lived in a beautiful part of the country, in the mountains. I am blessed to have received inspiration from the natural world around me, from children and animals, and all of this is reflected in my works.” What it is about Sixteen-year-old Ruskin, after having finally finished his school, is living with his stepfather and mother at the Old Station Canteen in Dehradun. Struggling to begin his writing journey, he tries to make a passage to England to chase his true calling. But as he prepares for his long voyage, the prospect of saying goodbye to the warm, sunny shores of India looms large. Brought straight from his past, Ruskin Bond recalls the longing for familiarity, the joys of receiving his first money order, publishing his stories and finding new friends. Following the trail of Looking for the Rainbow , Till the Clouds Roll By and Coming Round the Mountain , A Song of India is another year from the life of a fiery teenager as he embarks on a journey to an unfamiliar land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/on-a-literary-voyage/article32236257.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||One more time||Movie:Onward (2020) Genre:Animation, adventure comedy Blue-haired, elfs Ian Lightfoot and his older brother Barley live in the city of New Mushroomton, which once used to be inhabited by magical creatures and the practice of magic was common until technology took over and magic became obsolete. On Ian’s 16th birthday, their mother gives her sons a gift — a magical staff — left by their father who died right before Ian was born. Along with the staff is a rare gem and a letter describing a "visitation spell" that would bring back their father, but only for 24 hours. However, they can only perform the spell once and Ian has to make sure he gets it exactly right. After a glitch, they need to find another gem.  Wasting no time, they decide to take a chance and embark on an extraordinary quest in Barley’s epic van, Guinevere. Magic spells, cryptic maps, impossible obstacles and unimaginable discoveries...their journey is filled with all this and more. However, the trip does not remain all hunky dory, and meanwhile their mother realises that they are missing. She leaves no stone unturned and teams up with a part-lion, part-bat, part-scorpion, former warrior — aka The Manticore — and heads off to find them. Do they get a chance to reunite with their father? Do they say the spell right? What about the magic? Bridging the gap The director, Dan Scanlon, was inspired by the death of his own father when he was just a year old; his brother, who’s a few years older, had only hazy memories.  Onward took six years to create, from start to finish and animators created over 10,000 storyboards. The Burger Shire, a fast-food restaurant, has a sign reading, “Now serving second breakfast”. In the Lord of the Rings books and movies, second breakfast is a meal enjoyed by the Hobbits, who all live in The Shire. Look closely at the Manticore’s Tavern. The cook is actually Remy, the rat from Ratatouille, while other members of the staff are wearing Sorcerer Mickey hats. There’s even a Pixar ball in the background, emblazoned on a shield. The prize area includes the toy frogs from Toy Story 4. One of Ian’s classmates at the beginning and end of the film is wearing a Monsters University hat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/one-more-time/article32236264.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||A snowball in space||It is believed that the last time it graced the Earth’s skies was around 4,500 years ago. The next time it will visit us will be about 6,800 years from now. Say hello to Comet NEOWISE as it streaks by, giving us a rare celestial treat.       Cosmic wonders  Comets are dusty snowballs. They orbit the Sun just like planets do. They contain frozen gases, rock and dust, and are basically leftovers from the formation of the Solar System. When they go close to the Sun, they heat up, and the dust and gases form a tail – a distinctive feature of comets. Comet tails always point away from the Sun. There are probably billions of comets orbiting the Sun. Occasionally a comet will pass through the inner Solar System and get close enough for us to spot it from the Earth. If we are lucky enough, we might even be able to see it without a telescope or binoculars. Halley’s Comet, arguably the most famous comet in the world, was last seen in 1986. It becomes visible from the Earth every 75-76 years. Another memorable visitor was the Hale-Bopp comet in 1997. The tail of debris that comets leave behind can lead to meteor showers. The Swift-Tuttle comet, for instance, leaves behind debris that interacts with the Earth’s atmosphere to create the annual Perseids meteor shower.       Bright and brilliant  Comet NEOWISE was discovered on March 27, 2020, by NASA’s Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) spacecraft when the comet was streaking towards the Sun. It made its closest approach to the Sun on July 3 and then turned back to make its way towards the outer Solar System. Its nucleus is about five kilometres in diameter. Its dust tail and gas tail stretch hundreds of thousands to millions of kilometres, and it has water equal to about 13 million Olympic swimming pools. It is currently travelling at 2,31,000 kmph, about twice as fast as the Earth’s movement around the Sun. It orbits the Sun every 600 to 700 years. The comet is the brightest to be visible from the Northern Hemisphere in about a quarter century. It came closest to the Earth on July 22, at a distance of 103 million kilometres. Astronomers predict that it can be spotted till the end of the month, visible to the naked eye in the Northern Hemisphere — this includes India. It appears as a fuzzy star with a tail. Binoculars and telescopes, naturally, offer a better view. Keep your eyes on the north-western sky just after sunset. You might just get front row seats to an unforgettable spectacle.  The tail of debris that comets leave behind can lead to meteor showers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/a-snowball-in-space/article32236268.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||History lives on here||The Taj Mahal in India, the Hagia Sophia in Turkey, and the St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome are some of the iconic buildings in the world today. The Hagia Sophia, located in Istanbul, Turkey, is said to have changed the history of architecture as it was “the epitome of Byzantine architecture”. It remained the world’s largest cathedral for 1,000 years until the cathedral in Seville, Spain, was completed in 1520. The fact that an edifice of this magnitude has survived is little short of a miracle. Today, it attracts more than two million visitors annually. The beginnings Emperor Justinian I inaugurated the Hagia Sophia on December 27, 537 AD. Sophia is the phonetic spelling in Latin of the Greek word for wisdom. The church was dedicated to the Wisdom of God, the Logos. The present building was the third church to occupy the site, as the earlier one was destroyed. Justinian commissioned Greek architects Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles to build a new basilica. Initially called Magna Ecclesia meaning the Great Church because of its size, it had millions of golden glass cubes forming a glittering canopy overhead. Each cube was set at a subtly different angle to reflect the flicker of candles and oil lamps. The Imperial Gate dating to the 6th century was reserved solely for the emperor. Successive emperors were crowned in this cathedral. When the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople (now Istanbul) in the 15th century, they turned it into a mosque. In 1934, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish republic, turned it into a museum. The Hagia Sophia became a UNESCO World Heritage site and Turkey’s most famous tourist spot. Earlier this month, Turkey’s highest court allowed the museum to be converted into a mosque again. Incidentally, this World Heritage Site has a resident cat, 15-year-old Gli, which has her own Instagram account! Fun facts The material used were sourced from across the Byzantine empire: from Greecec, Egypt, the Bosporus region, and Syria.  It took five years, 10 months and four days for more than 10,000 men to construct the dome.  Forty windows in the area where worshippers sit reflect the light beautifully.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/history-lives-on-here/article32236227.ece

31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||Let the world know how curious you are.||Why do ants bump into each other?  Ants spend their entire lives in a colony, sharing their nest with thousands of others. Since ants cannot see, they must use their sense of smell to identify and coordinate with their nestmates. So, when ants “bump” into each other, they are, in fact, smelling each other to make sure they belong to the same colony. This way, they eliminate any threat to their colony. The other theory is that when an hungry ant pokes its nestmate with its antennae and, if the second ant has some food to spare, they both join at the mouth and mouth-to-mouth transfer of food takes place.  Do fish sleep?  We all need adequate sleep to help us function properly. Fish do too, just that they don’t sleep the way we do. While sleep patterns and time vary across species, the common factors are: reduced movements and remaining alert to danger. Some species float near the bottom, some close to the surface, and others nestle into the safety of wedges between corals or rocks. Their movements and breathing slow down, and they appear as if they are daydreaming. If you have a fish tank at home, you may notice the movement of their gills slowing indicating that they are breathing slowly while ‘asleep’.  How to ask a curious question  1. Pick a question. 2.

31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||Epitaphs||Sometimes, we discover that reel and real are not just a cliched turn of phrase. Like last week, when the most hardened of critics developed a lump in the throat after watching Sushant Singh Rajput’s Dil Bechara . Not necessarily because of the screenplay but because of how it reminded them of events in his life off it. It is not the first time though that life and death created a nebula around a film. There was a time in the 1980s when Doordarshan’s Chitrahaar often climaxed with a song of Love and God . There were no social media but old-timers would collectively gasp, ‘Oh! This is the last film of K. Asif. Poor chap could not complete it.’ Asif attempted four films in his career out of which two remained incomplete. But the one that he completed carried more weight than the voluminous filmography of many directors. Perhaps, that’s why everybody wanted to know, ‘what will he create after Mughal-e-Azam ?’. Well, he mounted Love and God with Guru Dutt and Nimmi in 1963, a timeless tragic romance of Laila and Majnu. But Guru Dutt’s sudden demise in 1964, which is another sad story, forced him to replace him with the then-emerging actor Sanjeev Kumar. The shooting started in 1970 but in 1971, Asif passed away at the age of 48. A token of tribute In the 1980s, the film was revived by his wife Akhtar Asif with the help of K.C. Bokadia. It was not a Bokadia kind of film, but he was repaying the debt of help he had received from Asif during his days of struggle. But once again fate intervened and Sanjeev Kumar passed away in 1985. He was 49. Not just the actors, even the original playback singers Mohammed Rafi and Mukesh were no longer around. Eventually, the incomplete film was released in May 1986, 23 years after it first went on floors. Actors dubbed for their younger selves and Naushad returned from retirement to record the background score. The film released after H.S. Rawail had already brought the tale of Kais and Laila home with Rishi Kapoor and Ranjeeta in 1976, and at a time when love stories had to compete with Jaanbaaz or find a way through Aakhri Raasta.  However, over the years, the film’s incompleteness and jinxed nature haven’t diminished Asif’s vision. Like Mughal-e-Azam, it is mounted on a grand scale and carries a deeper comment on the freedom of expression beneath a timeless love story. If Salim stands up to a monarch, here Kais questions the clergy. Take the scene where a group of clerics assembles to decide his fate on the basis of a question. Kais, dressed in white, tells his white pigeon, “See, what a time has come when a man is keen to decide another man’s fate.” The head cleric shows him a mirror on which Allah is written. Kais is asked what he sees in it. At that time, Laila appears on the balcony and her reflection finds its way into the mirror. Kais responds, “Laila!” All hell breaks loose, but Kais bursts into a song that carries Asif’s voice: ‘Yeh Nadaano Ki Duniya Hai’ (This is a world of innocents)’ Bodies come and go, it is the voice that lasts.  Epic tale of love Unlike Love and God , Asif’s good friend Kamal Amrohi’s Pakeezah, another epic tale of love marred by real-life barriers , had a happy ending at the box office. Some feel the audience of the 1970s took time to grasp the pace of a film that was envisioned more than a decade ago. Others say it got a push from the untimely death of Meena Kumari just two months after the film’s release, in February 1972. Amrohi dreamt of the story of a Lucknow courtesan way back in 1956, when his love for actor Meena Kumari blossomed. However, as their relationship soured in between, the film got shelved, only to be revived when Meena Kumari developed a serious liver complication. Still, she had to be persuaded by fellow actors such as Nargis and by a letter from Amrohi, where he described the film as a sinking ship that could reach ashore only under her care. In between, the film’s music composer, Ghulam Mohammad, and cinematographer, Josef Wirshing, who both played a vital role in making Amrohi’s dream film see the light of day, passed away. Ashok Kumar moved on to a different role and was replaced first by Dharmendra and then by Raj Kumar. However, as one could sense the presence of Guru Dutt in Love and God in some of the shots, here too Dharmendra’s shadow is palpable in the train sequence. Loosely inspired byAmrohi’s own life and his love for Meena Kumari, the film lives on as a comment on social perceptions that question the idea of purity. Amrohi pays the ultimate tribute to the beauty of a woman with evocative lines like ‘Aap Ke Paaon Dekhe...’ and ends with a bride’s palanquin arriving at a brothel. It still rings a bell, for life on and off screen has stayed intertwined.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/epitaphs/article32235474.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||A whole new whirl||From its origins in Istanbul, Morocco, Egypt and The Balkans, Sufi music, which articulates the wisdom of Islamic poets such as Amir Khusro, Rumi, Bulleh Shah and Hafiz, has found ever-widening audiences in world music forums. Every once in a while, the Sufi genre makes a memorable entry into Indian cinema. From ‘Mere Rushke Quamar’ ( Baadshaho ), ‘Maula Mere Maula’ ( Anwar ) and ‘Khwaja Mere Khwaja’ ( Jodha Akbar ) to ‘Kun Faya Kun’ ( Rockstar ), music composers have paid homage to the rich tapestry of Indo-Arabic-Persian poetry and music rooted in spiritualism. Joining the list is Malayalam cinema’s first OTT platform release (Amazon Prime), Sufiyum Sujatayum (Sufi and Sujatha), which celebrates a series of firsts. A contemporary fable that narrates the intensity of a mute Kathak dancer, Sujatha’s burgeoning but forbidden love for a whirling dervish Sufi mystic, the film traces the lovers’ separation, Sujatha’s unwilling acquiescence to an arranged marriage, and her inner turmoil that finds closure after she learns about the mystic’s death.  Ocean of mysticism The film’s Sufi-themed music showcases the works of two music directors — M. Jayachandran and rising young talent, Sudeep Palanad. What were Jayachandran’s sources of inspiration? “Musically, what we term Sufi encompasses elements of qawwali. Since childhood, I have listened avidly to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Sabri brothers, Aziz Miyan Qawwal, the ghazals of Begum Akhtar, Ghulam Ali and other luminaries. A constant source of poetic inspiration has been Jalaluddin Rumi’s ‘You are not just a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop’. So, this film has been the realisation of a long-cherished dream to work on an Indo-Middle Eastern theme. An experience which condensed me into ‘a droplet of divinity’ that focused on the creation of a capsule encasing an entire ocean of mysticism,” says the composer. Focal to the Sema ceremony of whirling dervishes, ‘Ayin’ is a vocal and instrumental piece featuring classical Turkish instruments. “My friend, a sound engineer in Dubai, helped me locate traditional practitioners Cem Ekmen (duduk), Huseyin Can Pala (baglama), Onur Nazim Engin (clarionet) and Canan Cal (voice),” he says. Due to the lockdown, their orchestral portions were recorded via Skype. It has also been the first time that authentic Turkish instrumentals were included in songs and BGM score recordings. “Director Naranipuzha Shahnavas and producer Vijay Babu helped fulfil my vision,” says Jayachandran. What was the creative process for the three songs? “Simplicity is the highest degree of sophistication. In this story, simplicity pervades every frame. I don’t usually select a specific raga. Each situation generates certain emotions which, in turn, generate the opening lines and key phrases around which the composition flows organically. For ‘Vathikkalu Vellari Pravu’ that has appealed to so many, the first two lines surfaced and kept playing in my mind. The rest just fell into place.” Mentoring two rising vocalists, Nithya Mammen and Arjun Krishna, Jayachandran has coaxed Nithya’s delicate voice to express the innocence of an unconditional first love, matching Sujatha’s childlike wonder and her half-hesitant, half-eager steps with the unfamiliar ambience that surrounds the Sufi. Watch out for Arjun’s burst of energy in the soaring anupallavi lines ‘Atharintey Kuppi Thuranney’ and Zia Ul Haq’s Urdu chants written by Shafi Kollam. Lyricist B.K. Harinarayanan sketches vivid vignettes of village life in a picturesque hamlet. Characteristic inserts of Sufi symbolism and allegory, such as ‘mylaanji kaadu’ (verdant thicket of henna), ‘mulla bazaar’ (flower market) and ‘praavu’ (dove) conjure up a striking imagery that lingers even after the visuals fade. At the core is the oft-repeated, plaintive sigh of ‘Roohe’ — a signature leitmotif that wafts ‘pranan’ (life breath/ soul) touched by divinity. Trained in qawwali In ‘Azan - The Light’, the ‘Allah Hu Akbar’ call for prayer is illuminated by the nuanced timbre of Kerala’s Zia Ul Haq, a Hindustani classical artiste and qawwal trained at the Sufi Inayath Khan Academy in Delhi. ‘Doori Teri’, powered by Madhuvanti Narayan’s contemplative vocals and Mumbai-based Manoj Yadav’s lyrics, is an elegy to Sujatha’s lost love that can never be borne to fruition. Here, anguished helplessness laces the melancholy. With minimal dialogues, the music itself becomes the voice of Sujatha’s emotions. How did Jayachadran approach the challenge? “Initially, it gave me sleepless nights! How was I going to find a particular frequency to express the inexpressible and convey mood through the BGM in scenes housing only visuals and music? The wisdom of my guru, the late M.B. Srinivasan was the eye-opener. He had taught me that silence speaks and pauses link — when to be silent, when to converse, to remain neutral, be aggressive. Above all, when to stop the music. To him, I dedicate the three background scores, which are contemporary-esoteric via Indo-Arabic confluences, shaded with warmth”. An exultant high In ‘The Journey’ theme, rhythmic patterns radiate anticipation during the protagonists’ first meeting on a bus journey. When the soul speaks, you listen. And when it sings, you break into dance. The way Sujatha does, in Aboob’s Clarionet theme, that spirals to an exultant high. In the ‘End Title’ theme, sadness gives way to serene solitude suggesting that the Sufi is at peace in the realm of eternity. Mesmeric would best describe the undercurrent of the looped ‘Noorullah’ refrain in Sudeep Palanad’s composition ‘Alhamdulillah’, as it rafts Amrutha Suresh’s vocals that meld passion with quietude. With Sudeep’s voice growing on you with every listening, the philosophy interwoven (‘Thank you god, for every pain and gain’) is about accepting one’s destiny. The orchestra includes the Turkish oud and Egyptian saz, with Indian artistes handling the percussion, acoustic guitar and keyboards. Touched by the overwhelming listener response, Sudeep says, “This song took shape in 2017. Shahnavas requested three elements — a devotional flavour (to enable it to be played at places of worship), Sujatha’s love, and the pain of separation”. One quality that compels attention is the effortlessness with which the melody retains its native identity while seamlessly blending in the Arabic flavour. How was this happy amalgam achieved? Says Sudeep, “Most listeners are accustomed to the Sufi cadences and percussive beats of the Punjab province. I owe thanks to Shahnawas, who urged me to tune into and absorb Middle Eastern styles. Frequent listening and internalisation teach one what to do and, importantly, what not to do when linking genres, while staying true to original forms”. In a throwback to an idyllic time and space, Sufiyum Sujathayum’ s music recreates an age of innocence with emotive intensity. In an uncertain present, when the pandemic has become a test of faith and hope, it comes as affirmation of both. And what better proof of that than the 10 million plus YouTube views they have drawn till now.  Initially, it gave me sleepless nights! How was I going to find a particular frequency to express the inexpressible and convey mood through the BGM in scenes housing only visuals and music?   Initially, it gave me sleepless nights!

31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||When music becomes a way of life||In an airy room where the sunlight streams in, a sruti box sits on a table. A frail hand finds its way to the power button and the room echoes with sound. After aligning his feeble voice to the sruti, a grand old man gently delves into a brief Begada alapana followed by the familiar Begada varnam. His voice sparkles, although his advanced years make it difficult for him to manoeuvre smoothly through the octaves. He signals me to sing along, often repeating phrases for me, stressing on the unique madhyama of Begada. At 97, Thanjavur Sankara Iyer is still in pursuit of Nadopasana. “If one learns to render each gamaka of Begada, Kalyani (Ata Tala) and Bhairavi (‘Viribhoni’ ) varnams, one can sing anything under the sky. That’s why I continue to sing them even today,” says one of the most revered musicians. Sankara Iyer is a a multi-faceted genius, who has composed several popular songs including ‘Natajanapalini’ and ‘Ranjanimala’. He is also a dedicated guru, veena player and an awe-inspiring performer. Born in Togaimalai in Tiruchi district in 1924 on Pongal day, to Kuppalu Ammal and Venkatesa Iyer, Sankaran had his initial training under his maternal grandfather, Krishna Iyer, a well-known musician. After the death of his father, Sankaran moved to Thanjavur where he lived with his sister’s family. In their neighbourhood lived musical giants such as Palghat Mani Iyer, Papa Venkataramaiah, Mahalingam Pillai and T.K. Murthy. Young Sankaran benefitted immensely through his interactions with them. The best of gurus Sankara Iyer’s career took a turn when his brother-in-law made him train under Sattur Krishna Iyengar in Madras. When his guru joined Annamalai University as a professor, Sankaran too enrolled there for the ‘Sangita Bhushanam’ course. There, besides his guru, he was guided by the likes of Tiger Varadachariar, T.K. Rangachari, Tiruppambaram Swaminatha Pillai, and Thanjavur Ponnaiah Pillai in vocal. He also learnt the veena under Gomathysankara Iyer and K.S. Narayanaswamy. After completing his course, he joined Devakottai Music School as a teacher and later, the Shanmukhananda Sabha Music School in Mumbai, where he worked for several years. In 1992, he returned to his alma mater as guest faculty and stayed till 1995. In 1996, he suffered a stroke that left him partially paralysed, but it did not deter him from pursuing music. He continued performing till mid-2000. In a journey that spans almost 85 years, Sankara Iyer has composed around 70 kritis in Tamil and Sanskrit, ranging from varnams to lakshana kirtanais, kritis to thillanas and javalis. His first kriti, ‘Ramanamame’ in Desh was composed when he was only 14. Creative repertoire His compositions such as ‘Mahadeva Sivasambho’ (Revati), ‘Muruga Tirumalmaruga’ (Harikhambodi) and ‘Paamalai’ (Shanmukhapriya) were popularised by legendary musicians such as D.K. Jayaraman and M.L. Vasanthakumari. His compositions are marked by a certain lyrical simplicity, but they project the grandeur of the raga. His disciple and renowned nagaswaram vidwan Injikudi E.M. Subramaniam says that when Sankara Iyer composes, it is a natural continuation of his musical introspection and brings out a raga’s unexplored aspects. “Once, while discussing raga Nayaki, Sankara Iyer sang an array of compositions while describing how it had been handled in nagaswara, veena and vocal traditions. Then he sang his own composition, ‘Ranganayaki’, and said that he had composed it to approach the raga differently,” recollects Subramaniam. Senior vocalist Neyveli Santhanagopalan points out that each of his compositions has a musical intention. ‘Natajanapalini’, for instance, projects the gandharam of Nalinakanti in its pallavi in contrast to Tyagaraja’s ‘Manavyala’ which stresses the madhyama. Musician Dr. Sunder, who was also Iyer’s physiotherapy consultant, learnt several compositions from him. He says that Sankara Iyer exudes positivity in his lyrics, never using words that reflect personal suffering. “He composed ‘Shanti Alithidum Kanthimati Deviye’ (Chenjurutti) while undergoing physiotherapy. Nowhere in the kriti does he plead to the deity to end his sufferings.” Student Valivalam Venkataraman recalls on how Sankara Iyer composed ‘Porutharulvai Bhoomi Thaye’ (Jayantasri) as a prayer following the 2001 Bhuj earthquake. He has also created several new ragas, such as Vishnupriya (‘Balasubrahmanyan balane’) and Hamsakalyani (‘Amba sri parameswari’).  Stickler for tradition Iyer’s students, who include several leading musicians of this generation, describe him as a teacher with the knack to make tough concepts look simple. Subrmaniam says, “For getting a gamakam right, he would ask students to move their head in a particular manner.” He would even tell them exactly how one should open the mouth to make each gamakam sound perfect. A stickler for tradition, he insisted that sangathis not be distorted in the name of manodharma. Alamelu Mani remembers Sankara Iyer as a perfectionist, who would prepare rigorously for several months before a concert. He would not just learn and present a kriti, but would keep singing it till he had internalised the connect between the sahithya and the raga as the composer would have envisioned it. Extolled by D.K. Jayaraman as the ‘musician of the century,’ Sankara Iyer was hugely respected by his contemporaries, including stalwarts like Ramnad Krishnan and S. Balachander. Sankara Iyer was part of a musical forum called ‘Friends of Music’ that had as its members an august group of musicians and music lovers such as T. Brinda, Raghava Rao and critic N.M. Narayanan. They met frequently and exchanged ideas. Iyer has won several awards and honours including The Music Academy’s Sangita Kalacharya in 1996 and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 2011. He continues to guide his students whenever they visit him in Tirunelveli. When asked about composing, he said that he wanted to perfect all that he has learnt first. He, however, still longs to play the veena, which has always been an extension of his musical thought.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/when-music-becomes-a-way-of-life/article32235507.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||The world of Kalpan a||Born in Jessore, now in Bangladesh, on June 27, 1919, Amala went to Paris as a 11-year-old with her father Akshay Nandy, a jeweller who was participating in the International Colonial Exhibition. In Paris, they met Uday Shankar, along with his mother Hemangini Devi and his brothers, including Ravi Shankar. Hemangini Devi took a liking to the young girl and so Amala’s father left her in Hemangini’s care. One day, Uday Shankar asked Amala to perform a little piece, and so impressed was he with her skill that he choreographed ‘Kaliya Daman’ for her, which Amala performed in Belgium in 1931, thus launching her dance career and her long association with Uday Shankar as dancer and later, wife. In the early 1920s, Uday Shankar had already met and performed with Anna Pavlova a series of ballets based on Indian themes with a distinct Oriental feel in costume and narrative. In the early 1930s, the dance troupe he created, ‘Uday Shankar and his Hindu Ballet’, expanded on this language as they toured the world. Pan-Indian dance In 1938, the dancer returned to India to establish the Uday Shankar India Culture Centre in Almora in order to create a new pan-Indian dance form that used European theatrical aesthetics with elements derived from various Indian dances. Amala, by now 20, joined the Centre. Here, her contemporaries were French dancer Simkie, the legendary Zohra Sehgal and her sister Uzra Butt, Narendra Sharma, Guru Dutt and Gul Bardhan. But Amala was the one to grasp Uday Shankar’s style best and, till the age of 93, she kept this legacy alive, passing it on to a legion of students. By 1942, the centre shut down. Uday Shankar now dreamt of making a film to capture the dances of India. He wrote a script about a dancer’s dream to establish a centre, a disguised autobiography. The same year, he married Amala, and the couple moved to Chennai to make the film. Uday Shankar wanted to name the film Imagination but Amala suggested the Indian word, Kalpana . Uday and Amala played the lead roles, with their Siva-Parvati dance considered spellbinding. The 80 dances Uday Shankar choreographed for the film covered many social issues, including ideas such as man and machine, the role of education etc. The film, shot in Gemini Studios, was released in 1948. But it was far ahead of its times and crashed at the box office. Today, it is seen as an invaluable archive of dance. After the film’s failure, the disappointed couple moved to Calcutta with their two children, Mamata and Anand. After a world tour in 1965, Uday Shankar established Kala Kendra in Kolkata and appointed Amala as its director. For 50 years, Amala worked here, teaching, performing, choreographing and mentoring three generations of dancers. Devoted to dance She possessed a strong will, was a disciplinarian albeit affectionate, and offered excellent training. She bore her son Anand Shankar’s death with fortitude, turning even more to dance. A great support to Uday Shankar, she was a pillar of both his choreography and administrative work. When ‘Life of Gautam Buddha’ was staged as a shadow play, she not only did the lead role and choreographed it, but also designed costumes and painted colour slides for projection, so versatile was she. Being the wife of a showman like Uday Shankar, she knew how best to project and direct dances. Daughter Mamata and daughter-in-law Tanushree followed in her footsteps and carried on the Uday Shankar style with innovative productions. An elegant and nimble-footed Amala performed with exquisite grace even at an advanced age. The legacy When I joined as the head of Rabindra Bharati’s Dance Department in 1980, I came in close contact with the dancer. For Uday Shankar’s 80th birthday, we planned to mount an exhibition of photographs of his works and name the dance hall in Jorasanko campus after him. That exhibition later became the nucleus for the Centenary Exhibition I curated in New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts in 2000-01. Amala lent many valuable photographs and shared amazing stories of her life. We were invited to mount a small exhibition at UNESCO in Paris and another at Nehru Centre in London. At UNESCO, Amala demonstrated Uday Shankar’s technique. In London, Amala spoke of their duets and of Anna Pavlova’s influence on Uday Shankar. In 2012, thanks to Pt Ravi Shankar telling film director Martin Scorsese about the film Kalpana, the latter was restored from a duplicate print preserved in Pune’s National Film Archives, and was screened at Cannes. Amala, at 93, walked the red carpet and said those famous words about being the youngest actor ever in Cannes. As a dancer, Amala kept alive the elusive and faintly Oriental style her partner had created. With her demise, an era comes to an end. The last representative of a certain kind of imagination in dance choreography has passed on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-world-of-kalpan-a/article32235484.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||Share the stage, pass the mic||A heated social media exchange some weeks ago offered the opportunity not only for a long overdue discussion on the real and complex history of Bharatanatyam, something most dancers, teachers and students rarely engage with, but also brought to the fore more recent contestations. Despite several scholarly works, the history of Bharatanatyam continues to be sanctimoniously traced back to origin stories associated with Siva or draws an imaginary linear history from Bharatamuni’s Natya Sastra . Only occasionally are there politically correct nods to the ‘devadasis’ as earlier custodians of the form, but this has not permeated the everyday “told” history of the dance. This continued obfuscation possibly explains why a 2017 TED talk that engaged with Bharatanatyam’s history became recently viral on social media. The need to engage That this talk was an eye-opener for many shows how fuzzy the understanding of India’s most popular cultural export continues to be. That it generated angry responses from others shows how much more closely one needs to engage with the inheritors of the dance form. As they pointed out, the community referred to as ‘devadasi’ prefers to be known now as the ‘hereditary courtesan dance community’. The TED talk debate flagged two things — first, that the term ‘devadasi’ conflates multiple identities and second, that their sexual exploitation and oppression is being misread as sexual agency (which too is a misreading). The term ‘devadasi’ has been used loosely to refer to hereditary dancers from various communities in Tamil Nadu such as the Melakkarar, the Nayanakkarar, the Dasi, the Sengundars and the Isai Vellalars and, in the Andhra region, the Kalavantulas. Further, women and trans women from the Jogati, Jogappa, Matamma and other communities, who identify as Dalits and are dedicated to temples in parts of Karnataka and Telengana, are often inaccurately referred to as ‘degenerate’ remnants of the devadasi practice. Creating a unified identity for so many distinct groups and practices is thus not only too broad-brushed but fails to recognise the different axes of their oppression. In his book Unfinished Gestures, Davesh Soneji emphasised that the ‘devadasis’ were courtesans and referred to them as “hereditary dancers”. He refuted suggestions that their profession was ‘degenerate’. Importantly, he called for a shift in focus that doesn’t stress only the temple origin or the politics of reform and revival. It is this shift that is called for even today. When late 19th-early 20th century movements stereotyped ‘devadasis’ and cast them in an essentialist mould, it was the result of several complex socio-historical factors of the time. An omnibus term that encompassed knowledge of dance, music and arts as well as the giving and receiving of sexual pleasure began, under colonialism, to be judged by an increasingly prurient and puritanical morality. What was once considered a professional ethic came to be viewed as criminal by leaving out the artistic, intellectual and ritual aspects of the practice. And the ‘devadasi’ came to be portrayed as a sexually exploited and oppressed figure. A lack of nuance The ‘reformist’ anti-nautch campaign linked to Dravidian politics and the Self-Respect Movement presented the temple dancer as a ‘prostitute’ and wanted to get rid of her altogether. The ‘revivalist’ movement, allied with the Theosophists and the Indian National Congress, presented her as a ‘nun’ so that she might be incarnated and embodied afresh. The questions, therefore, of sexual agency and oppression that have come up again now must necessarily be nuanced. It is within these fissures of scholarship, analyses, and commentary that stories of hereditary dancers exist. Debate, update To circle back to the recent social media fracas, the outcome is somewhat heartening. The TED talk site now has a fairly detailed update correcting terminology and providing references for further reading. A conversation about the preferred term ‘hereditary (courtesan) dancer’ took place and some quick tips were made available. However, debate around the issue will continue and this is perhaps not the end of it. The retelling of history to correct earlier problematic tellings cannot become another saga of inadvertent elisions and must constantly be revised to reflect new contestation. Feminism has taught us that there isn’t a monolithic oppressed woman who represents all women. So attending to nuance can help work through this jointly. If we do not ‘know’ how to tell another woman’s truth, we might invite them to tell their story, share the stage, pass the mic. As for audiences, our consumption of any art form passively, without awareness and alertness to its history and politics, is also a form of cultural appropriation. With the kind of access at our fingertips today, it’s not difficult to educate ourselves. But remember to look beyond social media for an education. As allies, the best one can hope for is that we are called-in, rather than called-out. But that can only be a grace that is given, not a right that can be demanded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/share-the-stage-pass-the-mic/article32235516.ece
31 July 2020||July 31 2020 00:00 IST,||Out of the SHADOWS||Conversations, performances and workshops — social media accounts of arts organisations are buzzing with activity. However, popular classical art forms have occupied centre stage in the digital medium too, while folk forms remain in the shadows. Samarpana for Arts and Wellbeing has taken several initiatives to not only turn the focus on folk arts, but has been extending support to these artistes through timely fundraisers. . Folk art is not just a window to local cultures and traditions but they represent the heart of communities. “They need to be promoted and preserved,” says Gayathri Suryanarayanan, founder, Samarpana. As she points out, folk artistes typically depend on the income earned during the Tamil festive months of March to July. Most of them take up their hereditary art forms at a very young age, which is often the main family source of income. Most of them are also school dropouts. This means they are seldom equipped to pursue alternate jobs. With their livelihoods hit hard by the lockdown, Samarpana decided to take up the cause of these artistes. The ‘Art Heals’ campaign is one such programme that brought together over 150 classical musicians and dancers to raise funds. Samarpana then launched the 100 for1000 campaign in collaboration with the Ministry of Culture, where people donate a minimum of Rs.100 that goes towards welfare packages for thousands of folk artistes. “Joining hands with the Ministry gave us an opportunity to interact with artistes from across the country. They were delighted about the opportunity to perform and also the remuneration. Our Lok Kala series (June 8 to July 8) featured over 30 folk forms. We reached out to obscure artist communities,” says Gayathri. The pandemic has brought to light the deep fault lines in the art world and the need for a change in how we approach this domain. “Tamil Nadu itself is home to over three lakh folk artistes. Not even 10 per cent of them have benefited from the State Government relief funds,” says Gayathri. This is as bad as the plight of the families of deceased artistes, who endure a lifetime without any benefits. “In fact,” says Gayathri, “while volunteering we found that starvation and debt had driven two artistes to suicide.” . The pandemic has allowed Samarpana to work closely with these communities. “In some cases, we have adopted the families. We plan to introduce them to cottage industry activities so that they can supplement their earnings.” Besides the obvious financial instability and uncertainty, the pandemic has affected the fraternity emotionally as well. “We have started Maithri to focus on the emotional well-being of artistes. We have a team of psychologists, nutritionists and yoga instructors working on this,” says Gayathri. Maithri is a free initiative for folk artistes and artistes from economically backward backgrounds, while other artistes can get the service at a subsidised price. “sms MAITHRI in your preferred language to 94450 22150 and we are here to listen and talk,” she adds. Samarpana’s social media platform now serves as a repository of performances and conversations, becoming essentially a digital archive. Going digital means that all this rich material will have a wider reach and greater inclusiveness. It also becomes a platform where artistes come forward to help their own community and participate actively towards the archiving of their traditions and practices.

31 July 2020||New Delhi,||As virus graph dips, DMs asked to reassess containment zones||With the number of new COVID-19 cases in the city on a downward trend, the 11 District Magistrates (DM) were on Thursday directed to reassess about 700 containment zones in the city, which is expected to bring down the number of such zones, according to officials. “The DMs have been directed to review all containment zones that are 28 days and older and with a population of more than 1,000 or more, based on directions received from the Central government yesterday [Wednesday],” a Delhi government official told The Hindu . They have also been asked to come up with a list of zones that can be removed from the list or made into micro containment zones for effective implementation of measures by Friday. The move follows an office memorandum issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Wednesday to all States to scale down operations and de-notify containment zones. Downscale measures “In view of the hardships faced by residents, States having such containment zones with prolonged lockdowns may opt for the following... The surveillance operations will be scaled down if no laboratory confirmed COVID-I9 case is reported from the containment zone for at least 14 days,” the memorandum said. This was earlier done after 28 days. A containment zone is a geographic area such as a large colony, a street, or even two or three houses, and people are not allowed to enter or leave such zones. “Some States have experienced continuing outbreaks in some containment zones and buffer zones [encircling the containment zones], keeping them under the lockdown for over months. In such cases, to have another period of 28 days, to de-notify such containment zones brings hardships to its residents,” the memorandum further said. “With the number of days coming down to 14 and directions to reassess the containment zones, the number of such zones will come down for sure,” a District Magistrate said. An official of another district said that it is better to declare smaller containment zones. “When a containment zone is large, officials are unable to implement proper measures,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/as-virus-graph-dips-dms-asked-to-reassess-containment-zones/article32235869.ece
31 July 2020||PATNA,||11 doctors die of COVID-19 in Bihar||The surging COVID-19 pandemic in Bihar has claimed the lives of 11 doctors and 250 more are infected, the State secretary of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) said on Thursday. Amid acute shortage of doctors and paramedics, the number of positive cases in the State crossed 48,000 on Thursday. As many as 12 doctors — two senior and 10 resident doctors — have tested positive at the Patna All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS-P) alone. “Besides, 30 nurses and technicians, 20 cleaning staff and 12 administrative staff too have been infected,” Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer at the hospital, said over phone. “The doctors who died are from Muzaffarpur, Rohtas, Gaya, Nalanda, Supaul, Patna and West Champaran districts,” said Sunil Kumar, IMA Bihar secretary. The State IMA chapter on Thursday issued an appeal to the people not to panic over instances of coughing, sneezing or fever in this monsoon season. “In case of any other symptoms and complications, they can contact the doctors named in our release,” Dr. Kumar said. Dr. Kumar expressed anger at the state of medical infrastructure in Bihar. “The condition is there for everyone to see. Against 16,500 sanctioned posts of doctors, there are only 6,500 working here. Similarly there is an acute shortage of paramedics and nurses,” he said. The Patna High Court had recently pulled up the State government for not filling up the posts of doctors. On Thursday, the government cleared the way for the appointment of 900 doctors. “But, out of these 900 doctors, 500 are already working on a contract basis… so where is the gap being filled?” said Dr. Kumar.  ‘Senior doctors needed’ “At a difficult time like this, we need senior doctors and experts to deal with the situation,” said a senior doctor at the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH). “The doctors at AIIMS, Patna, have to work long hours to meet the rush of COVID-19 patients. Since the condition at government hospitals in the State is bad, everyone wants to be admitted at AIIMS and doctors here are at a high risk of infection,” said a relative of a resident doctor who tested positive two days ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/11-doctors-die-of-covid-19-in-bihar/article32235844.ece
31 July 2020||New Delhi,||COVID-19 cases continue steady decline in the Capital||As many as 1,093 new COVID-19 cases were reported in Delhi in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 1,34,403, according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Thursday. Also, 29 more deaths have been reported, taking the tally to 3,936. Of the total cases, 1,19,724 people have recovered and there are 10,743 active cases. Since the daily count touched almost 4,000 – highest so far – on June 23, the number of new cases has been dropping and it has been less than 1,500 for the past 14 consecutive days. Active cases have decreased by 60.2%, from 27,007 on July 1 to 10,743 on Thursday. Of the total 19,475 tests done in the past 24 hours, 71.5% were rapid antigen tests, which have shown a low positivity in the city compared to RT PCR tests. The number of people admitted to COVID-19 hospitals has been dipping. On July 1, a total of 5,892 beds in COVID-19 hospitals were occupied and it has decreased to 2,950 on Thursday. In the same period, the number of COVID-19 positive people in home isolation has come down from 16,703 to 5,873. Also, the positivity rate, which is the percentage of people who test positive, has dropped from 12.2% to 5.6%. There are 694 containment zones now.  Meanwhile, the Delhi government on Thursday issued an order to form four committees to inspect 11 COVID-19 hospitals and give hospital-wise recommendations on following standard operating procedures and protocols. The committees will also examine the reasons behind the COVID-19 deaths in the hospitals. “It has been observed that the percentage of COVID-19 deaths vis-a-vis admissions and the percentage of COVID-19 deaths in wards in 11 hospitals is on the higher side from July 1 to July 23,” the order said. Following a High Court order, the Delhi government decided not to test people admitted with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) using rapid antigen tests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/covid-19-cases-continue-steady-decline-in-the-capital/article32235871.ece
31 July 2020||New Delhi,||L-G rejects Cabinet decision on lawyers for riots, anti-CAA cases||Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal on Thursday rejected the decision of the Delhi Cabinet regarding the selection of a panel of lawyers to represent it in cases of Delhi riots and anti-CAA protest in the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court. The L-G has issued orders to the Delhi government to notify the panel of lawyers suggested by Delhi Police instead of the panel of lawyers selected by the Home Department. As per the Constitution the Delhi government is now bound to implement the L-G’s order in this regard, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office said in a statement. “The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Governor of Delhi has rejected the decision of the Delhi Cabinet by exercising his special powers under Article 239AA(4) of the Constitution. Following this development, the Delhi government is compelled to issue an interim order to approve the panel of Delhi Police,” the statement said. The Delhi government held its Cabinet meeting on Tuesday to decide on the appointment of the panel of lawyers in the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court. The Delhi Police had sent a proposal to the Delhi government regarding the appointment of six senior lawyers, including Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Aman Lekhi as Special Counsel in the High Court and the Supreme Court in 85 cases related to the riots and anti-CAA protests. The Delhi government rejected the proposal stating that its standing counsel, Rahul Mehra, and his team were capable of contesting these. This was followed by disagreement on Mr. Baijal’s part who then sought the proposal sent by the Delhi Home Minister, using special powers. On Tuesday, the Cabinet, sources said, observed that there had been allegations that the investigations of Delhi Police in riots cases were “biased and not impartial”. The judiciary had also made adverse remarks against investigations by Delhi Police on “several occasions”. Sources claimed the Cabinet also termed the L-G’s “repeated expression” of his difference of opinion on the matter unfortunate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/l-g-rejects-cabinet-decision-on-lawyers-for-riots-anti-caa-cases/article32235860.ece

These decisions, the government said in a statement, were in continuation of others taken by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the past few days to ensure that Delhi’s economy, which has been impacted severely by the lockdown, gets back on track. “As part of the decisions taken today [Thursday] under Unlock 3 guidelines, Delhi government has decided to end the night curfew that was earlier in operation from 10 p.m. to 5 p.m. Since hotels of Delhi are no longer linked to hospitals, Delhi government has also decided to allow normal functioning of hotels and hospitality services, as already permitted under Centre’s Unlock guidelines,” the statement said. Earlier during the week, Mr. Kejriwal launched ‘Rozgar Bazaar’, a job portal to ensure synchronisation between businesses looking to hire and job-seekers looking for jobs, permitted street hawkers to start operating on a trial basis from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. for a week and de-linked hotels from COVID-19 hospitals so that they could start functioning normally. “It was decided today that the street hawkers will be permitted to function in the future without any limitations on hours of operation. Delhi government has also allowed weekly bazaars to function on a trial basis for a week adhering to social distancing and all necessary precautionary measures,” the statement also said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/unlock-3-to-end-night-curfew-allow-hotels-hawkers-to-operate/article32235865.ece

31 July 2020||Ghaziabad,||14 inmates escape from Mathura juvenile home||Fourteen inmates escaped from a government juvenile observation home in Mathura on Wednesday by removing the grill of a window, the police said, adding that nine were brought back after a night-long operation. District Magistrate, Mathura, Sarvagya Ram Mishra has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the matter. He admitted that the juvenile home had more inmates than the sanctioned capacity. Additional Superintendent of Police, Mathura, Udai Shankar Singh said: “The juveniles escaped by removing the screws of the grill of a window around 2.30 a.m. One of the home guards noticed the movement and informed the police. We immediately pressed police teams into action and search operations were carried out along the Yamuna bank. By morning nine of them were found and the search is on for others,” Mr Singh told The Hindu.  Local sources said the inmates were complaining of poor food quality in the juvenile home. Mr. Mishra said, “It is a matter of investigation, but the role of the home guard on duty and the in-charge of the juvenile home needs to be looked into as both were present at the time of the incident.” Prima facie, he said, the plot was hatched by one of the juveniles who was about to be shifted to the district jail because he had turned 18.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/14-inmates-escape-from-mathura-juvenile-home/article32235841.ece
31 July 2020||New Delhi,||HC asks governments to respond to plea on DMC Chairman appointment||The High Court on Thursday asked the Centre and Delhi government to respond to a plea seeking that no one should be appointed to the post of Delhi Minorities Commission (DMC) Chairman, which fell vacant recently. The plea has argued that since the constitutional validity of the DMC Act is under challenge in the High Court, no one should be appointed to head the commission till the matter is decided. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan also issued notice to the Lieutenant Governor’s office and sought his stand on the application by August 31, the next date of hearing. The application was filed by Vikram Gahlot, a social worker, in his main petition where he has challenged the constitutional validity of the Act under which the commission has been set up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-asks-governments-to-respond-to-plea-on-dmc-chairman-appointment/article32235856.ece
31 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||IIT-M back on board to instal smog tower: govt.||The government on Thursday informed the Supreme Court that the Indian Institute of Technology-Mumbai is back on board on the court-ordered project to instal a smog tower in Delhi to fight air pollution. But the project may take 10 months to complete. Appearing before a Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the “drawings” of the project would take two months. The court expressed dissatisfaction with the time frame, blaming the government for showing “laxity” in complying with its order on January 13 to complete the smog tower in three months. When Mr. Mehta submitted that it was IIT-M that had backed out of the project, Justice Mishra retorted “you [government] had to make the effort. Our direction was to your Ministry. This is a government project. It was for the government to do it... A detailed order has been violated and you seem to have no intention to comply with it”. “We will not tolerate laxity,” Justice Mishra said. Mr. Mehta offered to file an affidavit with an undertaking to complete the project. Amicus curiae Aparajita Singh suggested the court to ask the government to come up with a “firm time frame” on the project. The court listed the case on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/iit-m-back-on-board-to-instal-smog-tower-govt/article32235866.ece

31 July 2020||GURUGRAM,||Haryana to link registered organisations having contractual labour with HUM||The Haryana government has decided to link all registered sites and organisations having contractual labour with Haryana Udyam Memorandum (HUM) in the next six months. It will ensure complete benefits of Employees’ State Insurance and Employees Provident Fund to the workers. The State’s Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, who also holds the portfolio of Labour and Employment Department, said this while presiding over the second meeting of the State Advisory Contract Labour Board in Gurugram on Thursday. It was decided in this meeting that in the coming months, it will be ensured that the contractual labour holding organisations have a HUM number. Under this, the registration of contractors and workers is being done with their Aadhaar card number. The Labour Department will confirm that every such organisation is registered and after February 1, 2021, if any contractor or organisation is not found registered, then strict action will be taken against it. It was informed at the meeting that so far during this year, 427 institutes have obtained their certificates by registering themselves under The Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 in the State. Similarly, 1,882 contractors and organisations have obtained licences under this Act. It was also informed that under the Act, the primary employer or industry receives a certificate after registering itself by providing information about the empanelled contractors working with them to the State government. Thereafter, all the impanelled contractors apply under the Act and obtain a licence. The Act covers units or organisations with 50 or more workers. The second important agenda in today’s meeting was to allow contractual labour in the units related to rubber industry. In this case, it was decided to invite suggestions from all industrial associations and trade unions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/haryana-to-link-registered-organisations-having-contractual-labour-with-hum/article32235857.ece
