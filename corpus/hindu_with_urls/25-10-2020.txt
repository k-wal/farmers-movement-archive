They asserted theirs was “not an anti-national” grouping. Veteran CPM leader M.Y. Tarigami was elected the convener while Lok Sabha member from South Kashmir Hasnain Masoodi will be the coordinator of the conglomerate, known as the Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD). Sajjad Gani Lone of People’s Conference would be the spokesman for the amalgam. After a meeting held at Ms. Mufti’s house, Mr. Abdullah, who turned 84 earlier this week, said the alliance was fighting for the restoration of special status to Jammu and Kashmir and is an “anti-BJP platform” and not an anti-national amalgam. ‘BJP’s false propaganda’ “I want to tell you that this is false propaganda by the BJP that the PAGD is anti-national. I want to tell them that this is not true. There is no doubt that it is anti-BJP, but it is not anti-national,” he told reporters here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/farooq-to-lead-gupkar-alliance/article32938966.ece
25 October 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,||GITAM campus partially demolished in city||In an early morning swoop, the Revenue Department demolished part of the campus belonging to GITAM deemed to be university, here on Saturday. According to Revenue officials, about 40 acres of government land had been occupied by the educational institution and the management was informed about it. Speaking to the media at the demolished site, RDO Kishore Kumar said about 40 acres belonging to the government had been under occupation by the private university since many years and this was informed to them. According to him, the land was occupied both by GITAM Institute of Medical Sciences and Research and GITAM deemed to be University. He pointed out that at about 18 acres had been occupied under various survey numbers of Yendada and 20 acres under Rushikonda. “We have today demolished the compound wall on the Rushikonda side and also on the Yendada side and reclaimed the occupied land that is vacant inside the campus, which includes roads, gardens, playgrounds and other vacant sites. We have also done the markings,” Mr. Kumar said. According to him, permanent structures had also been surveyed and the marking had been done and it had been informed to the management. “Once we reclaim the vacant occupied land, we will then deal with the permanent structures in the next phase,” he said. The RDO informed that the private university had earlier sought for alienation of 71 acres of land at market value, but it was not accepted by the government. On whether notices were served, he did not give a clear answer, but said that the management was informed in advance. ‘No notices served’ The spokesperson of the private university claimed no notices were served and the demolition of an educational institute in such a manner was unlawful. A huge contingent of police force accompanied the demolition squad and cordoned off both the roads leading to the university on the Yendada and Rushikonda side, in the early hours around 3 a.m. Without any notice, the demolition began at around 4 a.m., said the spokesperson. Speaking to The Hindu , GITAM president, M. Sribharat said the demolition was gross violation of basic rules, as it was done in the early hours and on a holiday. GITAM was started by former TDP MP MVVS Murthi in 1980 and was the first private engineering college in this part of the State. It later turned autonomous and became a deemed university in 2007. It also started a medical college and is one among the designated COVID hospitals in the district. The campus stands on around 125 acres, with over 25,000 students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gitam-varsity-campus-in-ap-partially-demolished/article32938892.ece
25 October 2020||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan Assembly session on new farm Bills from Oct. 31||A special session of the Rajasthan Assembly to bring amendment Bills against the Centre’s recent agriculture sector laws will begin here on October 31. Assembly Speaker C.P. Joshi on Saturday convened the session, which was earlier adjourned on August 24 after the Congress government won the confidence vote on the floor of the House. The notification for convening the Assembly session was issued after the State government made a recommendation for carrying out an “urgent legislative work”. Official sources said the Governor’s permission for reconvening the sitting was not required because the Assembly was earlier only adjourned without the formal orders for prorogation. The Ashok Gehlot government is set to introduce the Bills, on the lines of those in Punjab, formally rejecting the new Central farm Acts and nullifying their applicability to the State. The Assembly may also adopt a resolution against the Centre’s “rigid stand” on the issue despite strong opposition by large sections of farmers across the country.  Cabinet approval The State Council of Ministers had earlier this week approved the proposal to bring the Bills in the Assembly, while laying emphasis on a mandatory provision for procurement of agricultural produce at minimum support prices. There may be penal provisions for those paying less than minimum support prices as in the Punjab Bills. As many as seven crops — wheat, gram, mustard, moong, urad, soybean and groundnut — are covered under MSP in Rajasthan. The State’s proposed farm laws may also restore the powers for settlement of disputes in crop procurement to the civil courts. The Chief Minister had recently indicated that Rajasthan would follow suit after the passage of Bills against the Central statutes in the Punjab Assembly. The Congress, which stood resolutely with the farmers, would continue to oppose the laws harming the agriculturists passed by the BJP-led government at the Centre, Mr. Gehlot had stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rajasthan-house-to-meet-on-new-farm-bills/article32939186.ece
25 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||Subsidised onion to be sold in Rythu Bazars at Rs. 35 per kg||In an attempt to provide some relief to consumers from the spiralling price of onions, which is around Rs. 100 per kg in retail, the State government has started sale of onions on subsidy at Rs. 35 per kg, in eleven Rythu Bazars in the city from Saturday. Minister for Agriculture and Marketing Singireddy Niranjan Reddy, in a statement issued on Saturday, said arrangements have been made to sell the subsidised onion at Rs. 35 a kg to consumers in Rythu Bazars. Every consumer can get a maximum of 2 kg of subsidised onions by showing their identity cards such as Aadhaar, voter ID and others at the counter. The minister said the government intervention would not only provide the pricey commodity at a subsidised rate to consumers, but would also help control the onion prices in the open market – at least prevent it from shooting up further. Stating that the onion crop has been damaged badly in the recent rains, the minister said the Centre had also banned hoarding of the commodity and fixed limits of stocking by the retail and wholesale vendors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/subsidised-onion-to-be-sold-in-rythu-bazars/article32939537.ece

25 October 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,||Govt. not vindictive: Minister||Reiterating that the government is not vindictive, Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao has accused the TDP for raising a hue and cry unnecessarily over the “reclaiming of government land” from GITAM deemed to be University. Addressing the media here on Saturday, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said the university was not a charitable organisation. “It charges exorbitant fee from the students and does not follow the rule of reservation. The government has reclaimed only the encroached extent as per the guidelines,” the Minister said. Wondering why the land was not regularised during the TDP term, the Minister claimed that many TDP leaders too had objected to the institution’s “illegal land encroachments.” Accusing the TDP leaders of creating hurdles in the path of development, the Minister said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was trying to strengthen government institutions unlike former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu who had worked for the benefit of private organisations. Earlier, at a separate press conference, YSRCP Anakapalle MLA Gudivada Amarnath alleged that the TDP was batting for those who had encroached nearly 40 acres of government land worth Rs. 800 crore in the city. Refuting the university’s claim that it was not issued prior notice, Mr. Amarnath said that five months ago, surveyors of the Revenue Department had conducted a survey and informed the university management that 40 acres of government land fell within the campus compound and that it would be reclaimed. In the year 2014, when Mr. Naidu was the Chief Minister, the university had applied for alienation of the land, he said. “How can the government consider if someone first encroaches land worth crores of rupees and then applies for regularisation?” he questioned. ‘SIT report soon’ Alleging that huge amounts of money had been swindled and vast extents of land encroached during the TDP term, the MLA said, “The YSRCP, then in the Opposition, had questioned the TDP over the encroachments in Vizag. Had we not mounted pressure, the Dasapalla Hills area in the city would have turned into a concrete jungle by now.” Under pressure from the YSRCP, the TDP government was forced to constitute a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the land scam. However, it did not make the SIT report public. The YSRCP, after coming to power, had constituted another SIT. Its report will be out very soon,” he added. Pendurthi MLA Adeep Raj said though GITAM was involved in irregularities, the TDP government had not taken any action considering the relationship between members of the university management, Mr. Naidu and TDP leader N. Balakrishna.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-not-vindictive-minister/article32939258.ece
25 October 2020||Bengaluru,||Rs. 25,000 for each flood-hit household: CM||A day after heavy rain brought parts of the city to its knees, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa inspected some of the worst-affected areas in Dattatreya Nagar, Dorekere and Kumaraswamy Layout to assess the damage. Accompanied by Revenue Minister R. Ashok, BBMP Administrator Gaurav Gupta and commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad, the CM announced a relief of Rs. 25,000 for each affected household. A BBMP survey puts the total number of houses flooded at over 410. Mr. Yediyurappa, who also holds the Bengaluru Development portfolio, directed the civic officials to identify beneficiaries and begin distributing the compensation cheques immediately. On Saturday evening, Mr. Ashok distributed around 50 cheques. The remaining will be distributed on Sunday. Earlier in the day, the CM held a meeting on the measures taken up by the BBMP in the rain-affected areas. “As per State Disaster Response Force norms, the maximum compensation that may be given is Rs. 10,000. However, taking cognisance of the extent of damages, it was decided that BBMP would give an additional Rs. 15,000,” said Mr. Prasad. During Mr. Yediyurappa’s inspection of Dattatreya Nagar, many residents demanded that he see the houses in the low-lying area that were flooded. However, after the crowds swelled, the Chief Minister, who has recovered from COVID-19, was forced to return to his car. Speaking to reporters later, Mr. Yediyurappa said he had directed the BBMP officials to find a permanent solution to prevent flooding. He also said all encroachments would be cleared and that the drive would be taken up soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rs-25000-for-each-flood-hit-household-cm/article32939472.ece
25 October 2020||New Delhi,||Kejriwal pitches for free COVID-19 vaccine for everyone||Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said that a vaccine against COVID-19, once approved, should be given to everyone in the country for free. “The whole country sho-uld get the vaccine for free. It is the whole country’s right, everyone is worried because of the [novel] coronavirus,” Mr. Kejriwal told reporters. He also said that schools in the Capital “are not opening now”. On September 30, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in its guidelines gave powers to the States to decide if they wanted to open schools from October 15, but the Delhi government has not allowed schools to function in the city because of high number of virus cases. Delhi on Saturday witnessed over 4,000 fresh COVID-19 cases for a second consecutive day with 4,116 persons testing positive in the past 24 hours, according to a health bulletin released by the city government. Also, 36 more deaths were reported, pushing the toll to 6,225. Of the total 3,52,520 cases, 3,19,828 have recovered and there are 26,467 active cases, the highest in the Capital in 23 days. The number of people in hospitals and under home isolation also increased on Saturday. Out of the total 15,737 beds available for COVID-19 treatment in Delhi, 66.1% were vacant, stated the government data. The positivity rate (percentage of people testing positive every 100 tests done) was 7.4% — the highest in over a month. Hunger strike Five resident doctors of North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run Hindu Rao Hospital continued their indefinite hunger strike for the second day on Saturday against non-payment of salaries of over 220 resident doctors of the hospital for three months. The five doctors started their hunger strike on the hospital premises at 4 p.m. on Friday and had spent the night at the hospital, which used to be a COVID-19 treatment facility. The resident doctors of the hospital have been on strike since October 5 over the salary issue. Attacking the BJP on the issue, the ruling AAP said that the North civic body should be handed over to it for one year and promised to run it better within the same budget and revenue. “It is unfortunate that at a time when organisations and institutions are giving bonuses to their workers for the festive season, the municipal corporation is not even paying the salaries to its employees,” AAP leader Durgesh Pathak said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kejriwal-pitches-for-free-vaccine-for-all/article32939188.ece
25 October 2020||Mumbai,||HC okays Dussehra celebrations at Nanded||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court has allowed a Nanded gurudwara to conduct its annual Dussehra celebrations going on since three centuries. However, Takht Sachkhand Shri Hazur Abchal Nagar Sahib will have to follow strict guidelines laid down by the court, which include mandatory COVID-19 test and no congregation. A Division Bench of Justices S.V. Gangapurwala and Shrikant Kulkarni was hearing a petition filed by The Takht Sachkhand Shri Hazur Abchal Nagar Sahib Board, Nanded, through its secretary Ravinder Singh. The petition was filed assailing the order passed on October 21, 2020 by the Secretary, the Disaster Management, Relief and Rehabilitation, Revenue and Forests Department, M.S. Mantralaya, Mumbai, which had rejected the Board’s representation to celebrate/conduct the Dussehra, takhat isnan, dipmala mahalla, gurta gaddi kirtan and gurta-gaddi sampathi kirtan darbar nagar kirtan event at Nanded. The court said, “The Board may celebrate the event of Dussehra by observing certain conditions: one Palkhi Sahib with Shri Guru Granth Sahibji; historical Nishan Sahib 16 numbers; horses of Guru Sahib, five numbers; Kirtan Jathe 03 numbers. The same shall be on two large open trucks. Sixteen persons would board one truck and eight persons would board another truck. The same would be for the distance of 1.5 Kms. as suggested in the application of the petitioner.” The court also said, “The petitioner shall get the test of Covid-19 performed of the persons boarding the trucks. Only those persons whose reports are Covid-19 negative shall be permitted to board the trucks. The said open trucks would be accompanied by pilot car and the escort car of the Police Department. The petitioner shall take videograph of the entire event from the stage of loading and the culmination of the event. En route, there shall not be congregation of persons. No person shall accompany the two open trucks on foot,” the court mentioned. The Bench said, “The order is being passed by way of an exception, which is not intended to be used as a precedent by other persons, to seek permissions, to hold any festival/festivities, which would involve by their very nature congregation of people.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-okays-dussehra-celebrations-at-nanded/article32938979.ece
25 October 2020||Bengaluru,||Children of govt., aided schools not given ration since June||Lakhs of students in government and aided schools have been deprived of dry ration kits since June. When schools closed because of COVID-19 in March and midday meals were stopped, the government provided the kits, which included rice and toor dal, for three months till May. Around 48 lakh children from class 1 to 10 depend on the midday meals and a majority of them come from lower socio-economic backgrounds and marginalised communities. Siddharth Joshi, an independent researcher with the Aahara Namma Hakku, Karnataka, filed an RTI application with the Department of Public Instruction to find out the months when dry rations were provided and the reasons for not doing so in certain months. “Officials from two districts [Tumakuru and Kolar] have told us that they gave dry rations till the end of May,” he said. Dry ration kits have not been distributed in other districts too. V. Anbu Kumar, Commissioner for Public Instruction, said they were waiting for a government order. “As soon it is issued, we will distribute rations for June and July. A proposal for the subsequent months has also been sent to the government,” he said. Activists say the delay has affected the students. Manjunath S., an auto driver whose two children study in a government primary school in Bengaluru, said, “I had no steady income for two months. I am able to provide only two meals a day to my children. If the school provided rations, it would have taken care of the food requirements of my children.” The midday meal is a right under the National Food Security Act. “The Ministry of Human Resource Development too had instructed State governments and Union Territories to ensure that they either provide hot meals or give food security allowance, comprising food grains and cooking costs, to children for the duration of the pandemic till schools were closed,” said Mr. Joshi. Sylvia Karpagam, a public health doctor, said there is a need to ensure that rations are supplied to children as there is a nutrition crisis among several families, which have been pushed into poverty owing to the pandemic. “The government should provide oil, milk powder, and eggs also to meet the nutritional demand of children,” she added.  I had no steady income for two months. I am able to provide only two meals a day to my children. If the school provided rations, it would have taken care of the food requirements of my children.Manjunath S.Auto driver whose children study in a govt. school||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/children-of-govt-aided-schools-not-given-ration-since-june/article32939476.ece
25 October 2020||CUTTACK,||NRIS quota in NLUs an affront to meritorious candidates: Orissa HC||Observing that Non-Resident Indian Sponsored (NRIS) category reservation is an affront to meritorious candidates, the Orissa High Court has called upon the Bar Council of India and other stakeholders to revisit the process of admission to National Law Universities (NLUs). “Worthy students toil day and night to secure a seat in NLUs by cracking Common Law Admission Test (CLAT). But NRIS students, by paying hefty donations, grab the seats of meritorious students,” the court observed. A Division Bench of Justice Sanju Panda and Justice S.K. Panigrahi said the NRI Sponsored candidates who are very low ranked in the merit list often get seats in NLUs, whereas the general candidates having secured better marks and placed higher in the merit list are denied admission. “This is like reservation for the elite class and this dubious category of reservation is unconstitutional,” the High Court said.  ‘Unregulated selection’ The court further observed that the eligibility and selection under the NRIS category are “unregulated, illegal and arbitrary”. It also cited a recent Supreme Court judgment in a case relating to private medical colleges in Rajasthan in which it held that private institutions that offer professional and technical courses have complete discretion to do away with their quota of seats after giving reasonable prior notice. “The consortium of NLUs, the BCI and all stakeholders involved in the process (of admission) should revisit the so-called NRIS quota and prepare a proper regulation and system. Several studies reveal that the selection process under the NRIS is quite vague, undefined and based on inconsistent parameters,” the High Court said while disposing of a petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nris-quota-in-nlus-an-affront-to-meritorious-candidates-orissa-hc/article32939195.ece
25 October 2020||Mangaluru,||Murder suspect shot at, arrested at Gundya||The Dakshina Kannada district police on Saturday shot at a murder accused and later arrested him. The police gave his name as Khaleel and he is accused of killing Umar Farooq alias Chenna Farooq in Bantwal town police limits on Friday evening. Farooq, 28, a resident of Kalladka, was hacked to death allegedly by a gang led by Khaleel. Old rivalry was said to be the reason behind the attack. The police immediately barricaded all exit points from the district to apprehend the accused, who were planning to flee. DK Superintendent of Police constituted a special team under Bantwal Circle Inspector of Police and comprising Sub Inspectors of Police from Bantwal Town, Rural, and Uppinangady police stations. The team got information on Saturday morning that the accused were on their way towards Bengaluru on NH 75 and intercepted their car at Gundya in Puttur taluk. While the police were securing the accused, Khaleel allegedly assaulted the team members with a weapon injuring Bantwal Rural PSI Prasanna. This forced Bantwal Town PSI Avinash to open fire at the accused. While Khaleel was arrested, the other accused managed to flee, a communique from the police said. Khaleel was a native of Kalladka and presently residing at Nandavara. The police are on the lookout for the remaining accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/murder-suspect-shot-at-arrested-at-gundya/article32939594.ece
25 October 2020||Kolkata,||Chittaprosad Bhattacharya’s paintings on display in online exhibition||Every year, during the festival season, art galleries and museums in and around Kolkata curate exhibitions mostly centred on the theme of festivals. As the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, presenting challenges to galleries and museums in organising physical exhibitions, the question that many of these institutions are grappling with is what kind of art they should bring into the public domain. Victoria Memorial Hall, along with DAG, a private art gallery, has decided to put together the art of celebrated painter Chittaprosad, known for his heart-wrenching sketches and drawings of the Bengal Famine of 1943-44, alongside economic exploitation, urban poverty and depravity. “It is a good time to choose the digital platform to convey some of the anguish from a people’s artist and for all of us to use this festive season to get out of our comfort zones,” Jayanta Sengupta, secretary and curator of Victoria Memorial Hall, said. The online exhibition titled ‘People’s Artist – Chittaprosad: In Solidarity, In Solitude’ has more than 40 works of the celebrated artist, from around Independence. Chittaprosad Bhattacharya (1915-1978) was a member of the Communist Party of India and worked as an artist-cadre during the tumultuous years before and after the birth of the new Republic.' His explorations of new spaces of political action led him to his work for children through puppets and storytelling, and shift into a more personal and intimate space of politics. In 1968, he wrote “art is neither a weapon or a means of propaganda of any ideology — as we were told a few years ago by the political pundits”, revealing his commitment to developing a visual language that could speak directly to and for all people. Five events Along with the online exhibition, the VMH and DAG have also organised five different events in October and November, where experts, art historians and academicians will shed light on the work of the celebrated artist. The events include a book talk by Sanjukta Sunderason (Leiden University) that will look at Chittaprosad’s experiments in art and politics, introduced and moderated by well-known art historian Tapati Guha-Thakurta. The artworks in the online exhibition have been sourced from the Ghare Baire, an exhibition put together by DAG at Currency Building, Kolkata and from the collection of DAG. Ghare Baire - The World, The Home and Beyond: 18th-20th Century Art in Bengal was commissioned by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India, and it has been produced by DAG in collaboration with NGMA. The exhibition that brings together three centuries of art from Bengal under one roof is at the newly-restored Currency Building in Kolkata. “The exhibition, true to the spirit of Chittaprosad, has been curated through a collective process, where a group of students from across the world have joined our ‘Curious Curatorium’ initiative. They are a part of a month-long exploration of the artworks, developing the curatorial framework and building a narrative through their selection of artworks,” said Sumona Chakravarty, Deputy Director, Ghare Baire, DAG Museums. Pointing out that the online exhibition on Chittaprosad and events around it has generated good response, Ms. Chakravarty said that for online exhibition one has to think about exhibitions in a broader context, which is the dialogue and discourse around the exhibition. Mr. Sengupta said that the exhibition on Chittaprosad has been “planned it in a way that it grows and grows, and acquires a life of its own by means of the conversations and interactions”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/chittaprosad-bhattacharyas-paintings-on-display-in-online-exhibition/article32938981.ece

25 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Extra interest charged to be credited by Nov. 5||Three weeks after informing the Supreme Court that the Centre would bear the additional compound interest on loans of up to Rs. 2 crore taken by retail borrowers as well as micro, small and medium enterprises, the government formally communicated the modalities of the scheme to lenders on Friday. Banks and other lenders, including cooperative banks and non-banking finance companies, have been asked to credit the difference between the compound interest and simple interest for the six month period between March 1 and August 31 into these loan accounts by November 5. This would be implemented even for borrowers who had not availed themselves of the moratorium on loan repayments allowed by the Reserve Bank of India up to August 31. At its last hearing on October 14, the Supreme Court had turned down the Centre’s request for a month to implement the scheme. The scheme would have ensured that borrowers with loans of up to Rs. 2 crore won’t have to bear compound interest on the interest dues accruing on their loans during the moratorium period. The apex court had given the Centre time till November 2 and said “the common man’s Diwali is now in the government’s hands”. “In view of the unprecedented COVID-19 situation, the object of the scheme is to provide ex-gratia payment of difference between compound interest and simple interest by ways of relief from March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020, to borrowers in specified loan accounts,” the Finance Ministry said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/loan-interest-waiver-to-be-credited-by-nov-5/article32938968.ece

25 October 2020||Special Correspondent,||APSRTC runs buses from Telangana border||There seems to be no end in sight to the stand off between the road transport corporations of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana with regard to resuming inter-State bus services. After exhausting all options to break the ice, the APSRTC on Saturday deployed 38 buses at six check-posts on the Andhra-Telangana border to fetch home-bound people in the festival season. “This is to enable Andhra people to visit families during the festival season,” Transport Minister P. Venkataramaiah told the media in Hyderabad on Saturday. Of the 38 buses, seven are deployed at the Garikapadu check-post near Jaggayyapet in Krishna district, four at Wadapally check-post, seven at Pylon, 13 at Kallugudem check-post, two at Jeelugumilli and five at the Panchalingala check-post. While the aim is to increase the number of buses based on public response, the initiative does not seem to have found much acceptance. “The response is poor,” said an official, explaining that this was because people did not want stopovers and the hassle of changing buses multiple times. The APSRTC stopped operating buses on March 21 after lockdown was imposed and resumed services later to Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The Minister requested Telangana to run buses at least till the border to spare hardship to the public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/apsrtc-runs-buses-from-telangana-border/article32938973.ece
25 October 2020||VIJAYAWADA,||Capping Polavaram project cost makes its completion impossible, says CM||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy emphasised in a review meeting on Polavaram on Saturday that capping the project cost at Rs. 20,399 crore would make its completion impossible, as land acquisition and R&R were costing around Rs. 29,000 crore which was approved by the Ministry of Jal Shakti, Central Water Commission (CWC) and Polavaram Project Authority (PPA). The Chief Minister observed that the total cost of the project considered by the PPA and approved by CWC stood at approximately Rs. 55,450 crore at 2017-18 price level and the revised cost committee constituted by the Government of India approved a cost of Rs. 47,726 crore, which has been accepted by the Ministry of Jal Shakti and the same has been recommended to the Ministry of Finance. Officials told the Chief Miniser that Andhra Pradesh incurred an expenditure of Rs. 4,014 crore, of which Rs. 2,235 crore was proposed for “extra budget release” by the Ministry of Finance to Ministry of Jal Shakti. The Ministry of Finance stated that the cost of irrigation component in revised cost estimate should be construed as approved by PPA at Rs. 20,399 crore as on April 1, 2014, and the Ministry of Finance sought a confirmation about it from the PPA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/capping-polavaram-project-cost-makes-its-completion-impossible-says-cm/article32938974.ece

25 October 2020||cuttack,||NRIS quota in NLUs an affront to meritorious candidates: HC||Observing that Non-Resident Indian Sponsored (NRIS) category reservation is an affront to meritorious candidates, the Orissa High Court has called upon the Bar Council of India and other stakeholders to revisit the process of admission to National Law Universities (NLUs). “Worthy students toil day and night to secure a seat in NLUs by cracking Common Law Admission Test (CLAT). But NRIS students, by paying hefty donations, grab the seats of meritorious students,” the court observed. A Division Bench of Justice Sanju Panda and Justice S.K. Panigrahi said the NRI Sponsored candidates who are very low ranked in the merit list often get seats in NLUs, whereas the general candidates having secured better marks and placed higher in the merit list are denied admission. “This is like reservation for the elite class and this dubious category of reservation is unconstitutional,” the HC said. The court said the eligibility and selection under the NRIS category are “unregulated, illegal and arbitrary”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nris-quota-in-nlus-an-affront-to-meritorious-candidates-hc/article32938982.ece

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Taking on the Generals and their Prime Minister||Pakistan has been there before. Political parties coming together in alliance to take on a military dictator or an authoritarian civilian government. This time, it is in the form and shape of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), which has both the Pakistan Muslim League (N) and the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) as leading lights. The old warhorse Maulana Fazlur Rehman, head of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F), is the president of the PDM. In 73 years of existence, Pakistan has been under military rule on four occasions. Time and again, the Army has demonstrated that it wants civilian Prime Ministers to be brought to heel. Usually, the coup has been the preferred khaki style but with Imran Khan as Prime Minister it’s been held out as a “hybrid” model of governance. Two recent rallies in Gujranwala, Punjab, and in Karachi, Sindh, have galvanised the Opposition and brought what were once two opposing poles of Pakistani politics — the PML (N) and the PPP — out in the open to attack both Prime Minister Imran Khan and his Army props. As many as 11 political parties, many of them regional entities, came together to form the PDM on September 20 in Islamabad. Demanding the Prime Minister’s resignation, they decided to put in place an alliance structure, which will “lead and guide nationwide protests against the anti-public and anti-nation government in a disciplined and integrated manner”. Arguing that Mr. Khan’s government had been accorded “fake stability” by the establishment, the PDM expressed “extreme concern” at the increasing interference of the establishment in Pakistablistering attack Blistering attack Such statements are pretty standard in Pakistani politics. But former Prime Minister and PML(N) leader Nawaz Sharif departed from the standard when he launched a blistering attack on the serving Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa, whom he had appointed to the job back in November 2016, superseding two generals senior to Gen. Bajwa. Mr. Sharif also took on the serving Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed, a close associate of General Bajwa, in his video address from London to the first PDM rally in Gujranwala on October 17. “You are responsible for the exit of my smooth-running government,” Mr. Sharif thundered at Gen. Bajwa. “You got judges to write the judgments you wanted,” Mr. Sharif, who is convicted for corruption, said. The three-time Prime Minister also laid the blame for rising prices and unemployment at Gen. Bajwa’s door. About the serving ISI chief, Mr. Sharif claimed, “all this had been done” at Gen. Hameed’s instance. His comments are nothing short of blasphemous in Pakistani politics. You can talk of the “establishment”, a euphemism for the Army, but you can’t name names. Mr. Sharif has broken that tradition and his public comments blaming Gen. Bajwa have created ripples in the country’s politics. Mr. Sharif is also likely to have created problems for his alliance partner, the PPP, and other more moderate and risk-averse politicians like his own brother and senior PML (N) politician Shehbaz Sharif. But then he’s sitting in London and is unlikely to return. The leader on the ground for him is his daughter Maryam Nawaz, someone to watch out for in Pakistan. On the defensive “The Army has been put on the defensive by the PDM rallies. Their spokespersons have to come out to defend them,” a Karachi-based analyst, who preferred anonymity, told The Hindu . “It’s good that Mr. Sharif is naming names. These things should be out in the open. Everyone knows who is backing Imran Khan’s government.” If Mr. Sharif ruffled feathers with his comments on Gen. Bajwa, the arrest of Captain Safdar, Maryam Nawaz’s husband, from their hotel room, in the early hours of October 19 after a successful PDM rally in Karachi, was nothing short of inexplicable. “Police broke my room door at the hotel I was staying at in Karachi and arrested Capt. Safdar,” Ms. Maryam tweeted after the incident. There is CCTV footage of Capt. Safdar being taken away by armed men as well as these personnel standing outside Mariyam Nawaz’s room. This story is unlikely to die down in a hurry and will be used by the PDM to hit out at both Mr. Khan and the Army leadership. But what happened before the arrest was equally bizarre. Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar, Inspector-General of Police in Sindh, was reportedly abducted by personnel of the Pakistani Rangers, a central force, on Sunday-Monday night, and forced to sign on the dotted line so that Capt. Safdar could be arrested. Later, IGP Mahar and 14 other senior Sindh police offers decided to take earned leave, only to withdraw their applications after top PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari called up Army chief Gen. Bajwa, who then ordered an “inquiry” into the incident. “The unfortunate incident that occurred on the night of 18/19 October caused great heartache and resentment within all ranks of Sindh Police... IG Sindh has decided to defer his own leave and ordered his officers to set aside their leave applications for 10 days in the larger national interest, pending the conclusion of the inquiry [ordered by Gen. Bajwa],” the Sindh police said on Twitter. All this stuff is unprecedented. If the Pakistan Rangers and Army personnel can kidnap an IGP of a province, then it raises questions on the country’s political system. The fact that Mr. Bhutto spoke to the Army chief and not the serving Prime Minister shows his lack of confidence in the leadership of Mr. Khan. The Prime Minister has himself played his dharna politics while in Opposition so he should be cognizant that events such as this bizarre kidnapping and arrest can sometimes have a long-lasting impact on people’s perceptions. Great partnership Mr. Khan and General Bajwa have had a great partnership going. “For the first time, the Prime Minister and the Army chief are on the same page. There are no differences of opinion even on foreign policy issues like India and Afghanistan. Make no mistake, Mr. Khan will complete his term in office,” an Islamabad-based analyst said. Pakistan is due for elections only in 2023. Whether it is Mr. Nawaz Sharif or the PPP leadership, the Army as an institution has never been totally convinced that the “civilians” are sufficiently attuned to furthering khaki interests. So, Mr. Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were built up to “partner” so that the Army doesn’t have to be seen taking power directly yet again. Economic strains can upset this Khan-Bajwa partnership. So can ham-handed actions of the kind on display in Karachi. Mr. Khan can probably ride out this storm with Gen Bajwa’s backing. Bluster, however, can’t be a substitute for governance.

25 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Kerala’s move to bar CBI draws flak||A purported move by the Kerala government to withdraw the general consent given to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to operate in its territory appeared to have become an irritant in the State’s arguably fraught relationship with the Centre. If implemented, Kerala will join a line-up of non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled States to ban the Central agency from functioning in their respective jurisdiction without the explicit consent of the provincial government. The States include West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and, soon, Maharashtra. Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muralidharan on Saturday decried the government’s reported plan. The State government wanted to fend off the CBI to cover up high-level corruption and save top leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) from being investigated for recurrent political murders in North Kerala, he said. The Pinarayi Vijayan government had brazenly recruited top lawyers from New Delhi to prevent the CBI from investigating Life Mission, a State-agency involved in providing free housing for the poor, on the charge of violating the Foreign. Contribution (Regulation) Act. The CPI(M) also feared that overlapping investigations by central law enforcement agencies into the UAE gold smuggling case and narcotic busts in Karnataka would reach the doorstep of its leadership. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the Congress-led United Democratic Front (LDF) would oppose the move to ban the CBI. The LDF wanted to conceal its corruption and other crimes, including “playing second fiddle to gold smugglers treasonously”, he said. ‘Centre using CBI’ Communist Party of India (CPI) State secretary Kanam Rajendran said Mr. Muralidharan seemed to imply that the BJP owned the CBI. He said the Central government had without compunction used the CBI to destabilise non-BJP ruled States, and Kerala was no exception. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) was aware of the plot to use the central law enforcement to discredit the government in the election year. The CPI had on October 23 requested the LDF to recommend to the government to withdraw the free rein accorded to the CBI under the provisions of the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act. The law clearly states that law and order and crime investigation are State subjects. The CPI(M) had on Friday formally requested the government to explore legal options to curb the CBI from acting on its own volition in Kerala. The CBI could probe local cases or charge-sheet suspects only with the permission of the State administration. The agency cannot act on its own accord even in cases involving scheduled offences. The CBI does not require the consent of the State government only in investigations ordered by the Supreme Court of the High Court, the party felt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/keralas-move-to-bar-cbi-draws-flak/article32938897.ece
25 October 2020||Patna,||RJD manifesto reiterates promise of 10 lakh jobs||The Rashtriya Janata Dal, which heads the Opposition Grand Alliance ( Mahagathbandhan ) in the Bihar election, released its poll manifesto on Saturday, in which it reiterated its promise of 10 lakh jobs and loan waiver for farmers. The manifesto was released by Tejashwi Yadav at a press conference at the party office here. The cover page of the manifesto displays photographs of Mahatma Gandhi, B.R. Ambedkar, Abul Kalam Azad, Ram Manohar Lohia, Karpoori Thakur and Loknayak Jayprakash Narayan, among others, but it does not have a photo of the party’s founder and its charismatic leader Lalu Prasad. Mr. Tejashwi Yadav’s photo finds a prominent space on the cover page. There is a message from Mr. Prasad in the document, in which he highlights how his party government fought a battle in the past to ensure social justice for the downtrodden and brought Bihar back on the path of development. Mr. Prasad, who is in jail in Ranchi after his conviction in four multi-crore rupees fodder scam cases, has also made a scathing attack on the NDA government in the State. “There are no jobs, atrocities against women have increased and happiness is missing from the face of farmers,” he says. While emphasising on its future plans for the State if voted to power, the RJD vision document also hit out at the BJP for trying to “fool the people” by announcing 19 lakh jobs in the State. “Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has been raising doubts about our promise of providing 10 lakh jobs, so how will his future government fulfil ally BJP’s declaration of 19 lakh jobs?” Mr. Yadav asked. The RJD announced that it would give priority to agriculture, industry and education if voted to power. Source of finance Replying to Mr. Kumar’s queries about the source of finance for the 10 lakh jobs, Mr. Yadav said the State’s annual budget is of Rs. 2.5 lakh crore “out of which his [Mr. Kumar’s] government is able to spend only 60%. The remaining of around Rs. 80,000 crore can be utilised by a competent government for people’s welfare”. The manifesto stressed on increasing income of farmers and waiving KCC (Kisan Credit Card) loan taken by cultivators till 2020. It also vowed to purchase grains from the farmers at an enhanced Minimum Support Price that would include bonus.  In the field of education, it promised to fill vacancies of teachers in schools on a war-footing. It declared that the party headed future government would increase budget on education to 22% of the total budget. Mr. Yadav said that if voted to power they would promote investment in the State for setting up industries so that its people were not forced to migrate outside.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rjd-manifesto-reiterates-promise-of-10-lakh-jobs/article32938913.ece
25 October 2020||Ahmedabad,||PM inaugurates three Gujarat projects||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated three projects in his home State of Gujarat — one each related to farmers’ welfare, healthcare, and tourism development — via video-conferencing from New Delhi. Mr. Modi launched the ‘Kisan Suryodaya Yojana’ aimed at providing day-time electricity to farmers in the State for irrigation and farming. The second project he inaugurated was a paediatric heart hospital at the U.N. Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre in Ahmedabad, developed with an investment of Rs. 470 crore by the State’s Health Department. The third project launched was a 2.3-km-long ropeway project on Mount Girnar in Junagadh city, a major pilgrimage site. The ropeway project is being touted as the longest temple ropeway in Asia. The ropeway has been developed by Usha Breco Limited at an investment of Rs. 130 crore. In his address on the occasion, Mr. Modi said, “The world-class ropeway will make it convenient for more people to visit Girnar. Earlier, it used to take five-seven hours to climb Girnar, but now it will take only seven-eight minutes. More devotees and tourists will visit Girnar. It will give a boost to adventure activities. I am also happy that the project will create more employment opportunities for local youth.” The Girnar ropeway is a state-of-the-art passenger ropeway comprising 25 cabins, including one glass-floored cabin, each having the capacity to carry eight passengers at a time. It can ferry 800 people in an hour, and 8,000 in a day. In his online inaugural address, Mr. Modi slammed the Opposition over the delay in completion of the ropeway project. “Had they not created hurdles in [the building of the] Girnar ropeway, it would not have been delayed for so many years. People and tourists should have got the benefit of it a long time back,” he said. On the Kisan Suryodaya scheme, Mr. Modi said, “Farmers should save water and adopt the mantra ‘per drop, more crop’.” He also stressed on using technology to boost production.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-inaugurates-three-gujarat-projects/article32938920.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||The socialist successor||Last Sunday’s landslide victory for Luis Alberto (Lucho) Arce in the Bolivian presidential election is, arguably, a repudiation of the policies of the military-installed right-wing government that was formed after the disputed October 2019 election. Mr. Arce, a socialist and the long-time former Finance Minister, polled more than the combined vote share of his two nearest contenders, and thus eliminated a run-off. His Movement for Socialism (MAS) party obtained a comfortable parliamentary majority. The emphatic victory ends the political instability of nearly 11 months, after an unelected and little known evangelical senator Jeanine Anez assumed charge as the transitional leader last November. The elections were postponed twice, citing the COVID-19 emergency, causing fury among MAS supporters. The recent verdict is simultaneously a resounding endorsement of Evonomics — the economic policies pursued under the former President of 14 years and the first indigenous occupant of the office, Evo Morales. They entailed the partial nationalisation of Bolivia’s extractive industries and revenue generation during the commodities boom, enabling the social redistribution programmes that lifted millions out of poverty. The latest results have sparked media speculation that the man behind the throne in La Paz would be Mr. Morales, Mr. Arce’s mentor and former boss, who is to return from exile in Argentina. But there are enough indications already that while the 57-year old protégé intends to build on the Bolivian model to revive the sputtering economy, Mr. Morales would play no direct role in the government. Mr. Arce’s plans include the substitution of the country’s import dependency with industrialisation on one hand, and securing international debt relief and levying a wealth tax on the other to raise revenues to continue MAS’s poverty alleviation initiatives. Low-profile moderate The President-elect, given his reputation as a low-profile moderate within the party, is perhaps best-placed to navigate the country’s recent tumultuous political divisions. Since the November 2019 ouster of Mr. Morales, the country has been rocked by violent confrontations between the security forces and MAS loyalists. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has dubbed the killings of protesters as a massacre and called for an international investigation. Born in La Paz on September 28, 1963, Mr. Arce grew up in a middle class family. He graduated from the University of Warwick, England, in 1997 with a masters in economics. Mr. Arce spent a large part of his career as a public official at the Central Bank of Bolivia. In 2006, Mr. Morales, who came to power riding the pink wave that was sweeping through South America, appointed Mr. Arce as the Minister of Economics and Public Finance. Ever since, he remained a close aide of Mr. Morales. He oversaw the rapid expansion of the economy as well as the public spending programmes, which helped MAS build a strong connect with the country's poor. Syncretic traditions Interim President Anez had rolled back many of Mr. Morales’s policies. Her display of the Bible at public appearances, in a demonstration of her Catholic identity, downplayed Bolivia’s syncretic traditions of respect for diverse racial symbols at a time when social relations have been strained. Underscoring the overall direction of his government and the urgent need for national reconciliation, the President-elect promised in a speech following his victory to establish a unity government, to effect change without hate and to learn from MAS’s past mistakes. The latter remark was possibly an oblique reference, among others, to the controversial and blatantly undemocratic judicial reversal of the 2016 referendum verdict, wherein the people opposed changes to the Constitution that would have authorised Mr. Morales to run for a fourth presidential term. The fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has placed the country as the third highest in terms of per capita rate of deaths, is the other big challenge facing the next government. Mr. Arce has earned a mandate for the policies he crafted in the past. Now the challenge is to live up to the expectations of the voters in the midst of the unprecedented public health emergency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-socialist-successor/article32938930.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||The Ramas of Thailand||In Thailand, the King traditionally enjoyed a god-like status. The monarchs from the reigning Chakri dynasty that was founded in 1782 are called the Rama Kings, after the Hindu God Rama, the avatar of Lord Vishnu. The institution of the Thai monarchy, which is roughly 800 years old, has its roots in Hinduism and Buddhism. While the warrior Kings, under different dynasties, adopted Hindu Gods’ names as their official titles, the Theravada Buddhist concept of ‘Dhammaraja’ (kingship under dharma ) has been the proclaimed goal of the monarchy. Even after it lost absolute powers in the 1932 Siamese revolution, the monarchy continued to enjoy an outsized influence in the government and society. Thailand’s strict lèse majesté rules shielded the King from public criticism, irrespective of the political changes. But the winds are now changing. Thailand, which has seen 12 successful coups since 1932, is no stranger to mass uprisings. In the past, protests were largely focussed on the government or the powerful military. What makes the ongoing agitation, started earlier this year against the military-backed government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha, different is that the protesters are increasingly targeting the monarchy. On October 14, protesters, mainly school and college students, tried to disrupt a royal motorcade in Bangkok that was carrying Queen Suthida and flashed the three-finger salute, a symbol of resistance and solidarity which they borrowed from The Hunger Games books and movies. It was an unprecedented show of dissent to the monarchy by protesters in a country where public criticism of the institution could land one in jail for up to 15 years. A day after, the government declared a state of emergency, banning public gatherings and censoring the media coverage of the protests. Not backing off But the protesters did not back off. They termed the emergency yet another move by the government to take away their freedoms. A week later, as it was clear that the students were determined to press ahead with their agitation, the government cancelled the emergency and called for calm. Protests in Thailand began after the pro-democracy Future Forward Party was banned by the country’s top court in February. But public resentment against the ruling elite was building up since the 2014 military coup that brought Mr. Prayuth to power. Since then, the military rewrote the Constitution, awarding itself and the monarchy more powers and privileges, and held an election last year, which made sure that Mr. Prayuth continued as the Prime Minister. The new King, Maha Vajiralongkorn (the 10th monarch of the Chakri dynasty, also called Rama X), who ascended the throne in 2016 after the death of his father Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX), blessed the coup masters, while the Generals spent millions to promote the monarchy. The King was earlier required to appoint a regent while travelling abroad. The new Constitution did away with this clause. The junta gave the monarch full control of the Crown Property Bureau, which manages the palace’s roughly $30 billion worth of assets. King Vajiralongkorn also brought two Army units under his direct control. He has steadily expanded the powers of the palace, while the military has used the monarch’s backing to gain legitimacy for its actions. For the protesters, if the Prime Minister represented a repressive regime, the King, who is mostly in southern Germany, is a symbol of extravagance at a time when the country was wrecked by the pandemic. In August, Anon Nampa, a 35-year-old human rights lawyer, called for reforms to the monarchy. The protesters have since submitted 10 demands to the government, asking for a separation of the King’s assets and the Crown Property Bureau, reducing the Palace’s share in the national budget, a ban on the King from expressing his political views and endorsing future coups. The protesters say they were not against the institution of monarchy. What they want are reforms — a democratic Thailand with the King being a ceremonial head of the state — not abolition. For now, the government has ignored such demands, and warned against “insulting” the monarchy. But the fact that even a state of emergency did not stop the protests poses a serious challenge to both the government and the King.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-ramas-of-thailand/article32938934.ece

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Millennial politicians are determined to take over the reins’||Professor Ashwani Kumar , political scientist at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, speaks on why the upcoming Assembly poll in Bihar is different from those in the past 45 years and heralds a new epoch in State politics:   The Bihar polls were considered a slam dunk but a spirited campaign and clever positioning by Tejashwi Yadav and Chirag Paswan seem to have made the contest interesting. Your take? The Bihar Assembly election promises to be historic in many ways. Whatever be the outcome of the election, the ageing political patriarchs from the days of Total Revolution ( Sampurna Kranti ) are set to fade into history; it is the last election with regard to those who came up during the Emergency and Mandal. If the 2005 election was about the Rashtriya Janata Dal’s (RJD) misrule, 2010 was a victory of Nitish Kumar’s ‘vikas’, and 2015 resonated with the return of Mandal titans Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar in ‘Naya Bihar’. The Assembly election of 2020 will be the last poll of the older generation of socialist leaders in Bihar. With Lalu Yadav in absentia, Ram Vilas Paswan deceased and the ageing Nitish Kumar facing the toughest political challenge of his life, Bihar is on the cusp of an improbable youth insurgency. Refusing to play the secondary role in the making of new Bihar, the starry-eyed upwardly mobile millennial politicians Tejashwi Yadav, 30; Chirag Paswan, 37; Mukesh Sahani, 35; Shreyasi Singh, 29; Garib Das, 26; Pushpam Priya Choudhary, 28; Sandeep Saurabh, 32, and many others, including fire-brand student leader Kanhaiya Kumar, are determined to take over the reins in a post-clientelisitic Bihar. Also, there is something novel here — these millennial young politicos or their cohorts belonging to subaltern groups point to further democratisation of politics, as a new youth elite has emerged through the resilient post-Mandal politics in Bihar. Many of whom you have named are political dynasts and inheritors, so what is new in this youthful politics? Unlike their famous fathers, who inherited the legacies of caste, rural and feudal experiences, these neo-dynasts are savvy with social media, electoral rhetoric and also conjure up an image of aspirational India. Demographically speaking, Bihar is a State with 80 million (65%) youth population, and it is home to a large proportion (58%) of youth below the age of 25. This demographic reality is reflected in the electorate, as there are as many as 56% voters in Bihar in the 18-40 age group among the 7.6 crore voters in Bihar. In other words, Bihar’s politics stands transformed by millennials and their generational cohorts. The four north Indian States of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have seen median ages fall, while the South is greying; this will have an impact and is having one within the established political parties too. How is the leadership within parties changing in Bihar? This unexpected youth insurgency has impacted all political parties and has initiated what is termed as a “demographic electoral shift in leadership”. Older-generation BJP leaders such as Sushil Modi, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Nand Kishore Yadav, Giriraj Singh are pitted against the rising new-generation stars such as Nityanand Rai. Likewise, veteran Congress party leaders such as Sadananda Singh, Madan Mohan Jha, Aditya Singh have handed over their pocket borough to the next generation sons and daughters. Schooled in the old grammar of patronage and caste, Upendra Kushwaha of Rashtriya Samata Party (RLSP) and Pappu Yadav of Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) are also facing the heat of gravitational force of rising youth. Interestingly, the older generation of bahubali politicians such as Anant Singh, Sunil Pandey, Surendra Yadav continue to be in the electoral fray, but Anand Mohan Singh’s 29-year-old Chetan Anand is contesting Shivhar seat on RJD ticket, signalling a generational shift even in the mafioso politics in Bihar. That sounds like a regular generational shift that’s happened in the past, how is it different from others? Strauss and Howe, the demographers who coined the term ‘millennials,’ have identified some core traits of them. Millennials, including post-millennials and Gen Z, consider themselves special, both as individuals and as a group. They are confident, tech-savvy, meritocratic, high-achieving, team-oriented and pressured to succeed even if it means donning the role of potential hackers of systems. And they are practical, entrepreneurial, and digitally networked than their more austere, risk-averse parents. Paradoxical as it might sound, they are not nationally powerful politicians as yet but they are locally influential, drawing huge crowds to their political rallies, and changing the local political equations and coalitions. Given his administrative experience as youngest former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, Tejashwi has excited the imagination of voters by his ‘million jobs’ pledge. With his audacious and strategic decision to part company with JD,U) while retaining the NDA, Chirag has invoked the powerful slogan of ‘Bihar First, Bihari First,’ making the Bihar election truly aspirational and open-ended.   These neo-dynasts are savvy with social media, electoral rhetoric and also conjure up an image of aspirational India||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/millennial-politicians-are-determined-to-take-over-the-reins/article32938915.ece
25 October 2020||BHUBANESWAR:,||Animals spared of sacrifice in pandemic-hit Odisha||Chatar festival in the Bhawanipatna town of Odisha’s Kalahandi district, which is usually marked by the sacrifice of thousands of animals and birds, passed off without much bloodshed on Friday. Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Kalahandi district administration imposed a strict security blanket that did not let devotees kill animals and birds in propitiating Goddess Manikeswari. Every year, the idol of Goddess Manikeswari is taken to Jena Khal on the outskirts of the town, and after some secret rituals, the deity returns to her abode. The return journey is known as Chatar Yatra. Lakhs of devotees from Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and West Bengal participate in the festival. A three kilometre main thoroughfare, and nearby lanes and by-lanes, turn red with animal blood. On this occasion, almost every family has an animal or bird to sacrifice. This year, the Orissa High Court had ordered ban on animal sacrifice. “No person including the State shall be allowed to sacrifice any animal or bird during ‘Chatar Yatra’ festival on the public road or in and around the precincts of the temple,” the Orissa HC had ordered while acting on a public interest litigation. “God is the creator of the universe. He has created the human beings, animals, birds and all the species on this earth. The animals and birds breathe like us. They have also a right to live in harmony with human beings and the nature. Like the parents cannot tolerate to see the blood of their children, deity cannot be pleased by sacrificing the animals,” it observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/animals-spared-of-sacrifice-in-pandemic-hit-odisha/article32938994.ece
25 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||KTU orders probe into question paper leak||Students of five engineering colleges in Kerala were found to have smuggled in mobile phones into the exam hall and shared the question papers of an engineering examination on Friday. The question papers of the third semester supplementary examination on ‘Linear Algebra and Complex Analysis’ were circulated by the students. As photos of the papers found their way to WhatsApp groups, answers were soon posted in response. The APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) has decided to cancel the examination and order an enquiry into the malpractice. According to official sources, the students caught indulging in the malpractice apparently sought to capitalise on the fear of novel coronavirus infection and banked on invigilators not coming close enough to detect the use of mobile phones. However, the vigilant teachers sensed something amiss and seized the mobile phones and other evidence from the students. Based on a preliminary report submitted by the Controller of Examination K.R. Kiron, the examination sub-committee of the Syndicate chaired by Pro-Vice Chancellor S. Ayoob decided to cancel the examination and order a fresh one at the earliest. KTU Vice Chancellor M.S. Rajasree ordered the principals of the affiliated colleges to conduct a detailed probe into the incident. The university is expected to lodge a formal complaint with the Police Cyber Cell on the basis of the investigations that could also ascertain any possible role of any external sources in supplying the answers to the students. An urgent meeting of college principals and chief superintendents of examinations has also been called to enforce proper conduct of examinations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ktu-orders-probe-into-question-paper-leak/article32938898.ece
25 October 2020||Mumbai,||In a first, Shiv Sena to hold Dasara rally in auditorium||The Shiv Sena has decided to organise its annual Dasara rally on Sunday at an auditorium in Mumbai and not on the Shivaji Park ground, where the event is traditionally held. This decision was taken in view of the COVID-19 safety protocols, in which the Sena-led Maharashtra government has prohibited political, social and religious gatherings, party sources said on Saturday. This is the first time the rally is being held outside Shivaji Park, where party workers gather in large numbers to hear the Sena chief address them on Dasara evening. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who is president of the Sena, will address the party workers from the Swatantryaveer Savarkar auditorium opposite the Shivaji Park ground at Dadar in central Mumbai at 7 p.m., the sources said. The Chief Minister and his family members will first pay their respects at the memorial of late party founder Bal Thackeray at Shivaji Park. Party sources said that only a group of 50 people, including Ministers and leaders, will have access to the auditorium. The event will be telecast live on all the social media accounts of the party. First rally as CM This is the first Dasara rally for 60-year-old Mr. Thackeray after becoming the Chief Minister. He will complete a year in office on November 27. Geeta Jain, an independent MLA and a former BJP leader, joined the Shiv Sena on Saturday. She visited the residence of Mr. Thackeray, where she was inducted into the party, a Sena source said. She was accompanied by Minister Eknath Shinde and Thane MLA Pratap Sarnaik. Ms. Jain, a BJP rebel, won from the Mira Bhayander constituency last year by defeating the BJP’s Narendra Mehta. After winning, she declared support to the BJP. Recently, Water Conservation Minister Shankarrao Gadakh, who had won from the Nevasa assembly seat as Krantikari Shetkari Paksh’s candidate, joined the Shiv Sena. On Friday, senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse joined the NCP, which is part of the ruling coalition in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-a-first-shiv-sena-to-hold-dasara-rally-in-auditorium/article32938923.ece
25 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||BJP questions ‘silence’ of Cong. leaders over Punjab rape||The BJP on Saturday accused the Congress of employing “selective outrage” in cases of crimes against women, questioning the silence of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra over the alleged rape and murder of a six-year-old girl in Punjab. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, at a presser at the BJP’s national headquarters in New Delhi, also took a swipe at Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav, questioning if he had asked Mr. Gandhi about the issue while holding a joint poll campaign with him in the State. She also noted that the child hailed from the Dalit community. Attacking Mr. Yadav, she referred to a news report of 2008 to mention the “allegations of eve-teasing and misbehaviour with women against the RJD brothers”, a reference to him and his elder brother Tej Pratap. “It [the Punjab incident] may not hurt the RJD because that is how things were when they were in power,” Ms. Sitharaman said adding that the RJD presided over “Jungle Raj” during its rule between 1990-2005. Hitting out at the Congress, she said, “The pretentious Congress has not said a word. The tweet-friendly Rahul Gandhi has not tweeted on the Hoshiarpur incident. There has been no outrage. And no picnic either.” Her “picnic” jibe was in reference to Mr. Gandhi and Ms. Gandhi’s visit to Hathras in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh following the alleged gang-rape of a Dalit girl, who died in a Delhi hospital subsequently. “The Congress party should stand up and answer. Does this kind of selective outrage suit the stature of their party? Why is the brother-sister pair not going and voicing horror in Hoshiarpur? Why not in Rajasthan? The selective cry of outrage that the Congress wants to show when it is elsewhere but not in States governed by it is completely exposed,” Ms. Sitharaman said. Stating that crimes like rape should not be politicised, Ms. Sitharaman said certain political parties are selective in voicing horror. The six-year-old girl was allegedly raped, killed and then set on fire, with her half-burnt body found at a home in Tanda’s Jalalpur village, the police said on Thursday. The accused — Gurpreet Singh and his grandfather Surjit Singh — have been arrested on the charges of murder, rape and under other Sections of the IPC and POCSO Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-questions-silence-of-congress-leaders-over-punjab-rape/article32938904.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Don’t get swayed by instincts, Karnataka High Court tells trial court judges||Noticing that a sessions court judge acted on hunches, instincts, and conjectures in convicting two persons for allegedly murdering a pregnant woman, the Karnataka High Court has said that “moral conviction bordering on strong suspicion is not an option with the courts as cases should be proved beyond reasonable doubt, based on evidences”. “Unless a judge trying a heinous offence does not administer a caution to himself, especially, when his moral sense of justice is seriously disturbed, he is likely to fall into an error inducing in him “an instinctive reaction against a dispassionate judicial scrutiny of the facts and law,” the court said. A Division Bench, comprising Justice S. Sunil Dutt Yadav and Justice P. Krishna Bhat, delivered the verdict while acquitting Yankappa S. and Hanmant S. of Vijayapura district of the charge of murdering Lakshmi, wife of Yankappa. Pointing out that the judge of Vijayapura sessions court himself had made “a significant observation that except the evidence of official witnesses, there is no legal evidence to substantiate alleged ill-treatment of Lakshmi as projected by the prosecution,” the court said the trial judge, in convicting and sentencing the accused to imprisonment for life, had “entirely acted on hunches, instincts and conjectures, which is impermissible in law”. Recalling what Benjamin N. Cardoz, who was an associate justice of U.S. Supreme Court in 1930s, had advised his colleagues, the Bench said: “a judge has no ‘will’ of his own”. “In the calling of a judge his only ‘will’ is, only ‘choice’ he has is – if that can be called one – to give force to the ‘cumulative effect’ of the evidence placed before him taking inspiration from the statutes applicable and settled precedents,” the Bench observed. Stating that “a judge is required to be dispassionate,” the Bench noticed that the sessions judge was “swayed by the fact that a woman, who was heavily pregnant had to meet a tragic end for no discernible reason and due to the same, subconsciously, perhaps on account of ghastly nature of the death, permitted himself to be provoked to connect, what appeared to his mind, the several links in the chain of evidence, albeit, non-existent ones resulting in his getting an impression that the case was proved beyond reasonable doubt.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dont-get-swayed-by-instincts-karnataka-high-court-tells-trial-court-judges/article32939121.ece
25 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||‘Hyderabad flood manageable with the help of technology’||Engineers and experts in subjects linked to flooding have opined that linking all the 185 tanks in and around Hyderabad with modern technology to divert flow of water during deluge coupled with measures to control flood (rainwater) flow by restoring ‘nalas’ and removing encroachments would help prevent flooding and inundation. Vice-chairman of State Planning Board, B. Vinod Kumar held a meeting with the engineers of Institution of Engineers-India (IEI) and other experts here on Saturday on “how to overcome flooding and inundation in the event of deluge in Hyderabad and alternative ways out”. The engineers and experts had detailed discussions on the issue before meeting Mr. Vinod Kumar. According to officials, the engineers and experts explained to Mr. Vinod Kumar that the unprecedented rains recurred in the city after a gap of over 100 years. The death toll in the 1908 floods in Musi was over 17,000 when the population of the city was only about 5 lakh. The recent flooding, however, had caused loss of life on a lower scale although the population had gone beyond 1 crore. Experts were of the opinion that 45% of the inundated/flooded colonies during the recent heavy rains experienced the impact of deluge for the first time and another 35% for the second or third time. The remaining 10% residential areas had, however, experienced, flood several times after 1908. Further, they were of the opinion that surplus flood water from Osmansagar (Gandipet) and Himayatsagar could be linked to the command area of Musi downstream by removing the encroachments along the river course so as to ensure obstruction-free flow within the course. Besides, the drainage and sewage water that is let into Musi should be treated on a daily basis before allowing it flow out of the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hyderabad-flood-manageable-with-the-help-of-technology/article32939552.ece
25 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Norms for last glimpse of face||The Kerala Health department has issued guidelines which will allow the family members of a person who has died of COVID-19 to have a last look at the person’s face, while following all protocols for handling the body. Accordingly, while observing all safety protocols, the healthcare personnel handling the body will untie the body bag just enough so that family members can have a last look at the face of the deceased. The standard operating procedures and guidelines for handling the bodies of COVID-19 patients have been issued by the local self-government bodies. The family members cannot gather to see the body or for conducting funeral as there are safety issues involved, the Health department has said. All family members will have to keep distance when religious rites are performed and none should be allowed to hug or kiss the body.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Mysuru policeman earns praise for helping orphaned sisters||An assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of police has earned the admiration of residents of Shiramahalli village in H.D. Kote taluk after he turned guardian angel to two orphaned sisters, who were living on the verge of starvation amid the pandemic. The sisters — the elder one aged around 16 had passed SSLC while the younger one was around 14 years and had passed VIII — were living in abject poverty in their dilapidated house in the village after they lost their parents about eight years ago. Their grandmother, who was taking care of them, too died a couple of years ago, making matters worse. With no relatives even to take care of them, the sisters were leading a pathetic life with no food to eat in the house. Their survival depended on the mercy of the villagers, who were giving them food. But, the situation took a turn for the worse during the pandemic. Shivalinga Kabini, a local lensman, shot a video of the pathetic condition of the sisters and posted it on his Facebook account with an appeal to the people to help the siblings. When Doreswamy, assistant sub-inspector of police, H.D. Kote, came across the video about five months ago, he immediately visited the house of the sisters. “I was moved by their pitiable condition. There was no electricity in the house. There were no beds or mattresses. There was no toilet. There was no food in the house”, Mr. Doreswamy told The Hindu . He immediately arranged for rations and groceries for the two. His wife, Chandrika, joined him in taking the girls to H.D. Kote town in his car to purchase clothes and other utensils for the house. Education He declared in the village that he was adopting the two sisters and will take care of their future needs. He has also facilitated the elder girl’s admission to a PUC college in H.D. Kote town while the younger one will continue with her high school education in the same village. Mr. Doreswamy also got their dilapidated house reconstructed with a new compound wall and concrete reinforcements. He spent Rs. 3 lakh from his own pocket. The housewarming ceremonywas performed earlier this week. The residents of the villagewere all praise for Mr .Doreswamy. Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar also called him over phone and praised him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/policeman-earns-praise-for-helping-orphaned-sisters/article32938885.ece

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Unlike Uttar Pradesh, Punjab did not block justice, says Rahul||Former Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday hit back at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the rape of a minor at Hoshiarpur in Congress-ruled Punjab, and asserted that, unlike the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress government has not denied the incident or threatened the family of the victim. Mr. Gandhi, in a tweet, said he would go to “fight for justice” in these States as well, if they blocked justice. “Unlike in UP, the governments of Punjab and Rajasthan are NOT denying that the girl was raped, threatening her family and blocking the course of justice. If they do, I will go there to fight for justice,” Mr. Gandhi said on Twitter with the hashtag #Hathras. Earlier, in the day, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had targeted Mr. Gandhi, and his sister and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, for “selective outrage” over rape, and their silence over the gruesome incident of a rape and murder of a minor in Punjab. Ms. Sitharaman had also accused the Congress leaders of visiting the Hathras rape and murder victim’s family as if they were going to a “picnic”. At a press conference, Mahila Congress president Sushmita Dev accused the BJP of playing politics over the Hoshiarpur incident because of the Bihar poll and targeted Ms. Sitharaman and her colleagues Prakash Javadekar and Harsh Vardhan for questioning the Hathras visit of the Congress leaders. “I hope that Nirmala Sitharaman ji will stop displaying her total insensitiveness to such a sensitive issue. Don’t politicise it,” she said, adding, “The nation understands that you have suddenly woken up from your deep sleep because Bihar is in an election mode. There is no second reason. Your party, your leaders and even Prime Minister Narendra Modi do not see beyond elections and that is why all of a sudden you have decided to make Hoshiarpur an issue.”  I hope that Nirmala Sitharaman ji will stop displaying insensitiveness to such a sensitive issue Sushmita Dev Mahila Congress president||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/unlike-uttar-pradesh-punjab-did-not-block-justice-says-rahul/article32938909.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Amarinder dismisses BJP’s criticism as ‘political puffery’||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday dismissed the attack by BJP leaders on his government over the Hoshiarpur rape and murder case, terming the remarks of Union Ministers Nirmala Sitharaman and Prakash Javadekar as “political puffery”. “Contrary to what these leaders were claiming, there is no comparison between the Hoshiarpur and the Hathras cases,” Capt. Amarinder said, pointing out in the latter instance, the Uttar Pradesh government and the police had not only failed to initiate stern action but also allegedly tried to cover up the matter to benefit the upper-caste accused. This, he said, was in sharp contrast to the prompt action taken by the Punjab police, which immediately arrested the accused. Ridiculing the BJP leaders’ criticism of the “so-called silence of the Congress leadership on the Hoshiarpur case”, Capt. Amarinder pointed out that his party had been forced to speak up and protest in the Hathras case because the State had failed to get justice for the Dalit girl there. “Had the BJP government in U.P responded as effectively and speedily as we did in Punjab, neither the Congress and the Gandhis, nor scores of NGOs, lawyers, human rights activists would have been forced to take to the streets to fight for the victim,” he added. “No BJP leader had uttered a word in protest against the acts of omission and commission of the U.P government and police, when the entire nation was in angry uproar,” he said. Slamming the party over its “politically motivated” reaction to the Hoshiarpur incident, he pointed out that unlike the Hoshiarpur case, the Hathras case and the subsequent developments were a part of a chain of atrocities being committed against Dalits in U.P.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/punjab-cm-dismisses-bjps-criticism-as-political-puffery/article32938911.ece
25 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||2 Srisailam units to resume generation||About two months after a fire brought power generation to a halt in the 6×150 megawatt underground Srisailam Left Bank Hydro Electric Station (SLBHES) near Eegalapenta in Nagarkurnool district, two of its units are set to resume generation formally on Monday. After experimental run to check various parameters of the two units on Thursday and Friday by running them for short duration in phases, trial run of Units 1 and 2 commenced on Saturday morning. During the experimental run, the two units were also synchronised with the grid on Friday evening. According to officials of the Telangana State Power Generation Corporation (TS-Genco), the trial run continued throughout the day and is likely to continue further. “But for the COVID-19 impact, the two units would have been revived last month itself. Several engineers and employees of the prestigious underground power station with the facility of reversible pump mode of generation and Director (Hydel) of Genco who was supervising the work too have contracted COVID-19 during the restoration/repair works delaying the completion by about three weeks”, a senior executive of the Genco told The Hindu on Saturday. They were able to bring back the two units to generation stage with spares sourced locally (within the country) and with local experts. “We are happy to revive the two units at least at the fag end of the flood season. It has been quite challenging but our engineers and employees have proved their mettle one more time”, the senior officials stated. With good inflows continue to reach the Srisailam reservoir from Bhima-Krishna-Tungabhadra rivers, the TS-Genco officials are hopeful of making up at least some lost ground in generation of the low-cost energy. Last year, generation in the Srisailam LBHES during September and October months was about 988 million units (MU). In 20 days of generation possible this August, nearly 400 MU energy was generated till the fire broke out on August 20 night bringing the facility to a grinding halt., officials explained. As part of the revival of the Srisailam LBHES, the Genco authorities have also replaced the outdated supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system there with a modern facility. Minister for Energy G. Jagadish Reddy, Chairman and Managing Director of TS-Genco D. Prabhakar Rao and other senior officials of the Energy department and power utilities are expected re-launch the two units of Srisailam LBHES officially on October 26. Genco officials plan complete restoration of three more units over the next three months, irrespective of possibility of generation, and the remaining one unit before the flood season next year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/2-srisailam-units-to-resume-generation/article32939203.ece

25 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Carbine deal a benchmark for UAE firms to invest in India’||The deal for 93,895 Close Quarter Carbines (CQBs) for the Indian Army, for which United Arab Emirates (UAE)’s government-owned small arms manufacturer Caracal was shortlisted, is like a “benchmark” for UAE industry and they are watching closely on further investments in the Indian market, said Hamad Salem Alameri, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Caracal in an interview to The Hindu . “Once this first contract moves, a lot of sister companies within the group will see this as a success story and people will have the confidence to come and invest in India,” Mr. Alameri said. However, while Caracal was shortlisted two years back, the final deal has been delayed and recently an in-principle decision was taken in the Defence Ministry to cancel the deal and take the domestic route for procurement. But no formal announcement has been made so far. “Nothing came to us officially on the cancellation or on the intent of cancellation,” Mr. Alameri said. He said in the last two years Caracal had developed lot of suppliers and technology partners and the starting point of indigenisation will be 60%. Stating that Caracal has already identified four locations to set up the facility and also identified local partners to be able to commence production immediately, Mr. Alameri said India is already part of their global supply chain and over 20% of the components fitted on the CAR 816 are already made in India. The deals for 72,400 assault rifles and 93,895 carbines were approved by the Defence Acquisition Council in January 2018 to be processed through the Fast Track Procurement route. Caracal which is looking to expand its presence in the Indian market, is now bidding for the Sniper rifles tender of the Army and also looking to supply sub-machine guns to the Home Ministry, Mr. Alameri added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/carbine-deal-a-benchmark-for-uae-firms-to-invest-in-india/article32938918.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Bihar result crucial to Congress revival||The Congress may be the junior partner in the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led alliance in Bihar but its performance in the Hindi heartland State could play an important role in the party’s revival plan. Amid a renewed call for Rahul Gandhi to take over as the Congress chief once again, the election could well be a litmus test for Mr. Gandhi, the principal campaigner for his party. It could also set the tone for the party’s campaign for the next round of Assembly elections, expected around April-May next year, in crucial States such as West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and the Union Territory of Puducherry. “These elections come at a time of churn within the Congress. The party plans to have a full-time president next year and if it does well and improves on its previous tally, Mr. Gandhi may become the natural unanimous choice. But if that’s not the case, then there will be challenge as senior leaders had recently written about the leadership question,” said Professor Sri Prakash Singh, Department of Politics, Delhi University. Good show in 2015 In the 2015 Assembly election, the Congress had its best performance in nearly two decades. Of the 41 seats it contested as part of the grand alliance between the RJD and Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) [JD-U], the party won 27 seats. The unexpected results were meant to be a trigger to revive the party in the Hindi heartland where it had lost out to leaders such as Lalu Yadav, Nitish Kumar and Ram Vilas Paswan — all products of JP [Jayaprakash Narayan] movement — and their brand of politics aimed at social re-engineering. But far from it, the then Bihar Congress chief, Ashok Choudhury, switched sides when JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) by parting ways with the RJD and the Congress. Dependent on alliance “The party at the State level as well as the central level only relies on alliances. Congress workers mostly carry on with routine political activity and become visible only during the elections,” said K.K. Jha, a member of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) from Bihar. “There were so many issues. From 15 years of anti-incumbency to the collapse of the health and education systems, the Congress should have emerged as the main voice of the people. Nearly 200 children died from encephalitis in Muzaffarpur but we could not hold the government accountable. Since it has become a habit of sorts to depend on alliances, our State leaders failed to raise issues strongly,” Mr. Jha added. No voter base In this election, of the 243 Assembly seats, the Congress has fielded candidates in 70 constituencies. But the party can hardly boast of a strong organisation on the ground or winnable candidates. “While the RJD has its Yadav and Muslim voter base intact, the Congress does not have a voter base or an organisation on the ground. And they have also not been able to reach out to any particular group such as the Brahmins and the Dalits, who used to be their traditional voters,” Professor Singh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bihar-result-crucial-to-congress-revival/article32938908.ece
25 October 2020||Kolkata,||Outlook bleak for Himalayan brown bears||A recent study on the Himalayan brown bear ( Ursus arctos isabellinus ) has predicted a significant reduction in suitable habitat and biological corridors of the species due to climate change, prompting scientists to suggest an adaptive spatial planning of protected area network in the western Himalayas for conserving the species. The Himalayan brown bear is one of the largest carnivores in the highlands of Himalayas. The study carried out in the western Himalayas by scientists of Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) predicted a massive habitat decline of about 73.38% to 72.87% of the Himalayan brown bear by the year 2050. “These losses in habitat will also result in loss of habitats from 13 protected areas (PAs), and eight of them will become completely uninhabitable by the year 2050, followed by loss of connectivity in the majority of PAs. Furthermore, simulation suggests a significant qualitative decline in remaining habitats of the species within the protected areas of the landscape,” Lalit Sharma, head of wildlife section of ZSI and the lead author of the study, said. Dr. Sharma said that in such a situation when the protected areas in the Himalayan region lose their effectiveness and representativeness, there is a need to adopt “preemptive spatial planning of PAs in the Himalayan region for the long-term viability of the species”. “The suitable habitats were mapped outside the PAs and are closely placed to PAs; such areas may be prioritised to bring them into the PA network or enhanced protection,” the paper reads. “We have taken the Himalayan brown bear as an example because it is a top carnivore of the high-altitude Himalayan region. The elevation gradient in which the brown bear is distributed is most vulnerable to global warming as this elevation belt is getting warmer faster than other elevation zones of Himalayas,” he added. “Such studies are very crucial as the habitat of such species is highly vulnerable to climate and unless we plan in advance, we cannot sustain its population in future,” Kailash Chandra, director of ZSI, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/outlook-bleak-for-himalayan-brown-bears/article32938928.ece
25 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||SHRC restrains power utility from stopping power to 251 quarters||Telangana State Human Rights Commission has restrained Northern Power Distribution Company of Telangana Ltd (TSNPDCL) from disconnecting 251 low-tension (LT) connections in the residential quarters of Mancherial Cement Company Private Ltd as also connection to Mulkalla pump house that supplies water to the quarters till November 17. The Commission has also restrained the cement company from evicting its 251 employees and their families from the company quarters till that date. In his interim order on a complaint filed by Akhil Sai Mallaram, an employee of the cement company and an electricity consumer, Member (Judicial) of the Commission Ananda Rao Nadipally held that prevailing COVID-19 pandemic situation and the current festival season are ample ground, as submitted by the petitioner, to retrain the power utility from disconnecting the connections and the cement company from vacating its employees from residential quarters. The petition was heard by the Commission on Friday and the interim order was issued on Saturday. The petitioner submitted to Commission that in June 2019 TSNPDCL had disconnected high-tension power connection to the Mulkalla pump house, the only source that supplies water to the residential quarters, due to non-payment of energy consumption charges. In August 2019, the power utility had sanctioned new domestic LT connections to all the 251 residential quarters of the cement company and since then the employees have been paying bills regularly including the bill amount of Mulkalla pump house. However, the power utility had again issued notice to the cement company to clear the HT connection dues or else it would disconnect the domestic connections to 251 quarters after October 23. Based on the power utility’s notice the company has asked its employees occupying the 251 quarters to vacate the quarters since there would be no power supply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/shrc-restrains-power-utility-from-stopping-power-to-251-quarters/article32939548.ece
25 October 2020||Kolkata,||Fewer people on Kolkata streets this Durga Puja||The Calcutta High Court order making Durga Puja pandals “no entry zones”, and the awareness generated by the administration in asking people to stay indoors to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, seemed to have worked as there were fewer people on the streets in Kolkata during the peak of Durga Puja festivities On October 23, when the State celebrated Saptami, the Kolkata Metro, which is considered the lifeline of transport in the city, ferried about 34,000 passengers. On a usual weekday before the Puja, the North South line of Kolkata Metro typically ferries more than twice the number of passengers. For instance, on October 21, 84,801 commuters had availed the services of the Kolkata Metro. On Saturday, October 24, the day when Astami is observed till 7 p.m. in the evening, only 24,300 passengers took the metro ride. Kolkata Metro officials said that there was hardly any crowd in the trains and on the platforms today. Unlike previous years, the Kolkata Metro has decided not to run special overnight trains to manage the Durga Puja crowd. The last trains are leaving the terminal station at 9 p.m. There are a number of other factors that led to fewer crowds this Durga Puja, officials said. While people have become aware that crowding could lead to a spike in infections, suburban and local trains are also not plying, which makes it difficult for people from the districts to soak in the festivities in the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fewer-people-on-kolkata-streets-this-durga-puja/article32938922.ece

The family of the victim said the girl had earlier confronted the accused when they made abusive comments as she was passing by on the street. Two of the accused have been arrested and are being interrogated, said the police. The girl’s father told the media that the men barged into his house in Rasulpur area and kicked the door open.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Farooq Abdullah to lead Gupkar alliance||Mr. Abdullah alleged that the BJP has tried to break the federal structure through acts like the abrogation of Article 370 and dividing Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories. “They have tried to destroy the Constitution of the country, they have tried to divide the nation, to break the federal structure which we saw what they did on August 5 last year,” he said. ‘Divisive tactic’ Stating that the BJP was doing propaganda against the constituents of the PAGD in Jammu and elsewhere in the country, the NC leader said, “They are trying to divide us (people of Jammu Kashmir and Ladakh) in the name of religion. This attempt will not succeed. This is not a religious battle; this is a fight for our identity, and for that identity, we are standing together,” he said. The amalgam, which met for the first time after its formation, will come out with a white paper within one month on governance in Jammu and Kashmir over the past one year, Mr. Lone told reporters after the meeting. The amalgam decided to hold its next meeting after a fortnight in Jammu, followed by a convention in Srinagar on November 17. As a mark of defiance to the constitutional changes made by the Centre with respect to Jammu and Kashmir last year, the alliance adopted the flag of the erstwhile State as its symbol. While the Communist Party of India’s Kashmir head A.R. Trukroo joined the PAGD, Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee has quietly distanced itself from the alliance. JKPCC chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir, who was part of the meetings that took place before the formalisation of PAGD earlier this month, has skipped the last two meetings. The JKPCC had said after the previous meeting that Mir could not attend due to the advice of doctors. Reacting to the announcements, J&K BJP chief Ravinder Raina said, “Conspiracies of the Gupkar Gang” would not be tolerated and anyone challenging the unity and integrity of the country would be jailed. He also announced that October 26 will be celebrated as ‘accession day’ to send a clear message that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. “We will celebrate October 26, the day when Maharaja Hari Singh signed the instrument of accession, as ‘Villai Diwas’ like Diwali and freedom celebration,” the BJP leader asserted. Hitting out at PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, the BJP leader said those feeling troubled and insecure in India should go to Pakistan as J&K is not their fiefdom. He asserted that no power on earth can restore Article 370 and the flag of the erstwhile State. “This time we have Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah and those conspiring against the country will not be forgiven. We will give our blood and our lives for our motherland and the tricolour,” Mr. Raina said, holding the national flag in his hand, told reporters here. Responding to the PDP chief’s statement that she would only hold the tricolour when the flag of the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir is restored, the BJP leader said only the national flag will flutter inthe Union territory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farooq-abdullah-to-lead-gupkar-alliance/article32938881.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Loan interest waiver to be credited by Nov. 5||The scheme would have ensured that borrowers with loans of up to Rs. 2 crore won’t have to bear compound interest on the interest dues accruing on their loans during the moratorium period. The top court, which had been hearing petitions seeking an extension of the six- month moratorium granted by the RBI on loan repayments, had given the Centre time till November 2 and said “the common man’s Diwali is now in the government’s hands”. “In view of the unprecedented and extreme COVID-19 situation, the object of the scheme is to provide ex-gratia payment of difference between compound interest and simple interest by ways of relief for the period from March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020, to borrowers in specified loan accounts,” the Finance Ministry said in its communique laying out the scheme’s contours. The scheme shall be applicable for loans availed by MSMEs as well as loans to retail customers for education, housing, consumer durables, automobiles, provided an individual borrower has an aggregate outstanding loan of Rs. 2 crore or less, from all such loans. Credit card dues have also been included in the scheme’s ambit. The ex-gratia payment shall be admissible, irrespective of whether the borrower had availed the moratorium partly, fully, or not at all, the Ministry said. However, this would only be permitted for loan accounts that had not been reported as non-performing assets as on February 29. A loan is recorded as a non-performing asset or NPA, 90 days after repayments become overdue. A mechanism has been put in place for banks to claim the amount back from the government, as per the missive sent on Friday to the RBI, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and all other financing institutions. Lenders have to submit claims for reimbursement by December 15 through a special cell set up in the State Bank of India (SBI). Lenders have been asked to set up a grievance redressal mechanism for eligible borrowers under the scheme within a week, keeping in mind the guidance issued by the Indian Banks’ Association regarding the resolution framework for COVID-19 related stress. For resolving grievances of the lenders while implementing the scheme, the dedicated cell for the scheme in the SBI will work in tandem with the Finance Ministry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/loan-interest-waiver-to-be-credited-by-nov-5/article32938882.ece

Several chartered accountant bodies had been urging the government to extend the returns filing timelines this year in view of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic that led to a national lockdown starting March 24. The government had earlier extended the deadline from July 31 to November 30. The deadline for businesses to file annual Goods and Services Tax returns and reconciliation statements for the financial year 2018-19, has also been extended from October 31 to December 31, 2020. The government said it had received a number of pleas for the extension in view of the pandemic and lockdown, and the GST Council had also recommended that taxpayers be given more time to comply. “Further, in order to provide relief to small and middle class taxpayers…the due date for payment of self-assessment tax for the taxpayers whose self-assessment tax liability is up to Rs. 1 lakh had been extended to November 30, 2020,” the Central Board of Direct Taxes said in a statement on Saturday, adding that these deadlines had been extended again “to provide relief for the second time to small and middle class taxpayers”. The due date for payment of self-assessment tax for these taxpayers has now been extended to January 31, 2021 for those who need to furnish audited accounts or report specified transactions. For the rest, the deadline has been extended to to December 31, 2020. Consequently, the date for furnishing of various audit reports under the Income Tax Act, including tax audit report and report in respect of international/specified domestic transaction, has also been extended to December 31, 2020 from the earlier extended deadline of October 31, 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/deadline-to-file-i-t-returns-extended/article32938883.ece

25 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Nepal has not diluted Kalapani claim’||The map used to convey Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli’s Vijaya Dasami greetings was distorted because of technical reasons, the government of Nepal clarified on Saturday. Rajan Bhattarai, Foreign Affairs Advisor to Prime Minister Oli, said Nepal has not diluted its claim to the Kalapani region which has been at the centre of a territorial dispute. “Scaling down of the image for online usage created this impression. It’s a technical issue. We have not changed our position at all on the territorial demand. The government of Nepal is strongly committed to the map that was passed by Parliament. It was the same map that was actually used in the message by the honourable Prime Minister,” said Mr. Bhattarai over phone from Kathmandu.  Social media to blame The response came after The Hindu reported that Mr. Oli’s message showed an old map which did not include the strategically located Kalapani-Lipulekh-Limpiyadhura region of the Pithoragardh district that Nepal has been claiming. Mr. Bhattarai blamed the online media of Nepal for creating ‘confusion’. “We are using the new map and the revised insignia for our festival greetings.” The issue began on Friday when Mr. Oli sent out online greetings for Vijaya Dasami or Dashain which is the biggest festival of Nepal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nepal-has-not-diluted-kalapani-claim/article32938903.ece

Addressing a press conference in Patna while campaigning for the Congress candidates,he said that by amending the Essential Commodities Act, the Centre had now allowed hoarding by traders. A State government could act only in the event of a war, drought or a 100 % increase in prices. “This is a law for capitalists... It’s not even two months since the law was passed but the consumer can already see its impact. Onions that were selling at Rs. 30-40 a kg is now selling for Rs. 70-80,” Mr. Baghel said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/baghel-links-farm-laws-to-onion-prices/article32938905.ece
25 October 2020||ARIYALUR,TAMIL NADU||Clash between DMK and AIADMK cadre, case filed against eight||The police on Saturday filed a case against eight persons for attacking a DMK cadre. A group led by A.P. Senthil, town secretary of the AIADMK, barged into the house of the DMK cadre Densi Selvakumar (39) and attacked him with logs on Friday. They vandalised furniture and windows in the house. A motorcycle was damaged. The attack was said to be a fallout of Selvakumar’s objection to the AIADMK men according a grand welcome to Government Chief Whip Thamarai S. Rajendran, who returned to Ariyalur from Perambalur after receiving an award presented by a private television channel on Friday. Selvakumar, who was standing on a road when Mr. Rajendran was given a reception, reportedly abused Mr. Rajendran for violating “social distancing norms.” On Saturday, a group of DMK cadre led by its district secretary S.S. Sivasankar laid siege to the Ariyalur police station, urging the police to book all those involved in the attack. They dispersed after the police registered a case against Senthil and others. Besides Senthil, Siva alias Paramasivam, president of Eruthukaranpatti panchayat, were booked. Mr. Sivasankar alleged that the police had favoured the accused by invoking mild IPC sections due to the pressure exerted by the ruling party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/clash-between-dmk-and-aiadmk-cadre-case-filed-against-eight/article32939059.ece
25 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Safety guidelines go for a toss as crowds throng T. Nagar||Despite several warnings, the public as well as business houses continue to ignore norms, including wearing masks and maintaining physical distance at T. Nagar, the main shopping hub in the city. While big shops in the locality are now strictly keeping a tab on visiting customers by checking temperature and advising them not to take off their masks, the smaller ones are yet to get their act together. “After a popular textile chain was sealed, many shops have become alert and are strict about the number of people who are allowed in,” a textile shop owner in Pondy Bazaar said. “But with the festival season around the corner, it is highly impossible to restrict the crowds. We have received instructions from the police to restrict the number of people on each floor — if we do that we will end up losing business as well as regular clients,” he said. Several retailers echoed the opinion. Another retailer on Usman Road pointed out that the Greater Chennai Corporation said those who violated safety norms would be fined, but monitoring was lax and people had become lethargic. “The Corporation teams need to be more vigilant at least during the festival season. They should deploy volunteers. Only then will the public follow rules,” he noted. Shop owners here said the crowds would increase once suburban trains resumed operations. Many without masks On Saturday, many people who came to shop in the afternoon never maintained physical distancing; many were standing outside shops without wearing masks. Arunachalam, a shopper, said, “With no air conditioning in many buildings, it is suffocating to wear a mask all the time.” On Saturday evening, Additional Commissioner of Police, South, R. Dhinakaran, accompanied by Joint Commissioner of Police A.G. Babu and Deputy Commissioner of Police, T. Nagar, D.N. Hari Kiran Prasad, went around the busy shopping spots in T. Nagar and reviewed arrangements to ensure that all COVID-19 safety norms were being adhered to. Mr. Dhinakaran said shopkeepers had been asked to follow the norms that were suggested to them. “We have asked them to permit customers in a phased manner. Only 50 customers will be allowed at a time on a floor. They can issue tokens to avoid crowding. The shop owners have agreed to our suggestions,” he said. Barricades have been placed on Ranganathan Street, and shopkeepers have been asked not to display signboards or put up stalls on the street to avoid congestion and the allow free movement of shoppers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/safety-guidelines-go-for-a-toss-as-crowds-throng-t-nagar/article32939499.ece
25 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Opposition’s role is not to remain silent, says Stalin||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday said if his party’s efforts to get 7.5% reservation for NEET-qualified State government school students in medical college admissions was seen as a political game, it would wholeheartedly accept the charge of politicisation. Addressing a demonstration organised by the DMK to press Governor Banwarilal Purohit to grant assent to the Bill seeking to implement the 7.5% reservation, Mr. Stalin said Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami might accuse the DMK of playing politics as he did not understand the issue. “The Opposition will play politics [ arasiyal ] and not prepare aviyal [a dish],” he said. Reiterating that the DMK would not rest until the Governor gave his nod to the Bill, he said Mr. Palaniswami, “who crawled to get the Chief Minister’s post”, could plead with the Governor for his consent. “We do not expect the Chief Minister to crawl before the Governor. What is the justification for occupying the Chief Minister’s seat when you are not able to request the Governor for his assent?” Mr. Stalin asked. In a statement later, he said if the Chief Minister was keen on proving his efficiency, he should get the Governor’s assent for the Bill. Pointing out that 40 days had passed since the Bill was sent to the Governor for his assent, Mr. Stalin wondered what the need was for the Governor to take into account the legal aspects since the reservation was recommended by a retired judge, Justice Kalaiyarasan. “If the Bill gets his assent, around 300 government school students can get entry into medical colleges. Otherwise, only eight will get seats. How can we remain silent in the face of such injustice?” he asked. He wanted to know what the need was for the Governor to delay his assent since he had travelled across the State and earned a name for his active approach. “He would have probably thought the AIADMK government will not question him. But the DMK will,” he said.  If the Bill gets his assent, around 300 government school students can get entry into medical colleges. Otherwise, only eight will get seats||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/oppositions-role-is-not-to-remain-silent-says-stalin/article32939077.ece
25 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||No COVID-19 deaths at RGGGH in 24 hours||For the first time in several months, the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), the largest government tertiary care hospital in Tamil Nadu, recorded no deaths due to COVID-19 for 24 hours. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan told reporters that deaths due to COVID-19 among patients admitted to the government medical college hospitals as well as institutions under the Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services were reducing. “There was not a single death at RGGGH on Friday,” he said. RGGGH Dean E. Theranirajan said the hospital recorded no deaths among COVID-19 patients from 8 a.m. on October 23 to 8 a.m. on October 24. He added that the number of daily deaths due to COVID-19 had come down slowly at the hospital because of a multi-disciplinary approach. This was the first time in many months that the hospital, which has treated a high number of COVID-19 patients since March, is reporting zero deaths. Managing the patients “We framed uniform protocols for management of COVID-19 patients based on three categories of the disease: mild, moderate and severe. We established zero delay in initiating care. Chest physicians, anaesthetists, internal medicine and allied specialists such as from neurology, cardiology and nephrology were designated as treatment coordinators, with separate teams working under them,” he said. Separate teams were formed to manage patients with diabetes and renal disease. They monitored blood sugar levels, titration of insulin and treatment, he said. “We reviewed the deaths on a daily basis. This helped us to scrutinise the main causes of death among COVID-19 patients and take measures to prevent deaths. For instance, we noticed that dyselectrolytemia — imbalances in the electrolyte — in elderly patients. To address this, we involved the nephrology team and came up with a treatment protocol. Similarly, we have come up with treatment guidelines for patients with hypertension and COVID-19, coronary artery disease and COVID-19, and for those diagnosed with new onset diabetes,” he said. Noting that COVID-19 cases had declined by 50%, the Health Secretary said, “For nearly a month-and-a half, the State was reporting COVID-19 cases in the range of 5,000 to 6,000 a day. This has slowly decreased. Now, on average, we are testing 80,000 samples, of which nearly 3,000 persons are testing positive.” He said complaints were being received about private laboratories charging in excess for tests, and action would be taken if laboratories did not adhere to the fee fixed by the government. On 7.5% reservation Asked whether the Governor seeking time to decide on the 7.5% horizontal reservation for NEET-qualified government school students would affect medical admission counselling, Mr. Radhakrishnan said the Central government conducted counselling for the all-India quota seats separately. “As far as Tamil Nadu is concerned, we will come up with the prospectus for MBBS after the decision,” he said. A multi-disciplinary team of doctors of RGGGH, including plastic surgeons, had treated two patients from Andhra Pradesh — a 30-year-old with facial injuries caused in an animal attack and a child with facial injuries due to an accident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-covid-19-deaths-at-rgggh-in-24-hours/article32939512.ece
25 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC rejects woman’s plea to quash domestic violence case||The Madras High Court has rejected the plea of an aged woman to quash a domestic violence case filed by her daughter-in-law with allegations that she was driven away from her matrimonial home in Chennai and was forced to live with her sister in Coimbatore. Justice P.N. Prakash rejected the argument that the mother-in-law had no role in the marital affairs between the couple and that she had been unnecessarily dragged into the litigation. The judge held there were prima facie materials and hence the case could not be quashed. Complainant’s claim He said the complainant had claimed to have spent nearly Rs. 3 lakh for treating the petitioner after the latter suffered a fracture on her leg and that the money was not returned to her. The complainant had also accused the petitioner of taking away her jewels. Hence, the judge refrained from quashing the case at the threshold but allowed the petitioner, considering her age and the long distance that she had to travel, from appearing in person before the trial court during every other hearing of the case. ‘Execute bond’ He directed the quash petitioner to appear before a special court for domestic violence cases in Coimbatore on November 9, execute a personal bond for Rs. 10,000 under Section 88 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and undertake to appear as and when necessary. Thereafter, her personal presence during the regular hearings of the case could be dispensed with if she engaged an advocate with a special vakalat (an authorisation given to advocates to represent their clients), the judge ordered. ‘ He further directed the petitioner to file an affidavit stating that she would not dispute her identity and that her counsel would cross examine the witnesses, in her absence, without adopting any dilatory tactics. The judge also ordered the petitioner to appear before the trial court whenever it required her presence in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-rejects-womans-plea-to-quash-domestic-violence-case/article32939071.ece
25 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC dismisses son’s plea against payment of maintenance to mother||The Madras High Court has dismissed a case filed by a person challenging two consecutive orders passed by courts below directing him to pay maintenance of Rs. 5,000 a month to his aged mother under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.). Justice P.N. Prakash said he did not find any manifest illegality in the order passed by a judicial magistrate court in Salem in 2012 and confirmed by a Sessions court in 2014 while dismissing a revision petition preferred by the son under Section 397 of Cr.P.C. The judge pointed out that an order by a judicial or metropolitan magistrate for payment of monthly maintenance to parents, wife or children could be challenged by way of a criminal revision petition either before a High Court or a Sessions Court. After the petitioner moves a revision application before the High Court or the Sessions court, no further application by the same person could be entertained by either of the courts. There was a specific bar on it under Section 397(3) of Cr.P.C. In an attempt to overcome such a bar, the present petitioner had preferred an application before the High Court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. (inherent power of the High Court to prevent abuse of process of any court or to secure the ends of justice). Holding the course adopted by the petitioner as not maintainable, Justice Prakash said petitions under Section 482 could be entertained by the High Court only if there was a manifest illegality in the orders passed by the courts below. “In the present case, this court does not find any such illegality. The mother-son relationship is not disputed. Only the quantum of maintenance is challenged. This is a question of fact which has been gone into by the two courts below,” the judge said, and dismissed the case. Until September 24, 2001, Section 397 of Cr.P.C. authorised magistrates to order maintenance to a maximum of Rs. 500 a month. However, after the 2001 amendment, they were empowered to fix the quantum as they deemed fit according to the facts and circumstances of each case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-dismisses-sons-plea-against-payment-of-maintenance-to-mother/article32939107.ece
25 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chennai police personnel felicitated||Commissioner of Greater Chennai Police Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal appreciated the bravery of three personnel who jumped into Adyar river and saved a youth who was drowning. According to the police, sub-inspector Karthikeyan, attached to the Kotturpuram police station, grade I constable Subbiah Suresh and Armed Reserve constable Prasanth Shakthi Ayyapppan were on patrol around Adyar on Wednesday when they saw a youth jumping into the river near the bridge. They jumped in and pulled him out. They administered first aid and took him to a hospital. The police learnt that he was Vishnuvarman, 25, of Kotturpuram. He was frustrated after his father scolded him for being jobless, and he decided to end his life. In another case, a policewoman was rewarded by the Commissioner for rendering timely assistance to a labourer, who fell on the road after a sudden seizure. The police said while Muthukrishnaveni, grade I police constable, attached to the Villivakkam station, was on bandobust duty, she saw Muthukrishnan, 35, a loadman having a seizure.

25 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CRPF develops reusable protective suit||The 97th Battalion Rapid Action Force (RAF) of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Avadi, has developed a reusable microbial preventive suit that can be used by frontline workers engaged in COVID-19 prevention duties. The pandemic has led to an increase in the manufacture of personal protective equipment (PPE). A PPE kit, used once, needs to be disposed of, so that the virus does not spread. The microbial preventive suit is an advanced version of the PPE. “Our main intention...is to protect our own troops doing COVID-19 duties. Now that health workers, police personnel and other frontline workers are affected by the novel coronavirus, we feel it is our duty to extend this service to them,” RAF Chief Commandant Erick Gilbert Jose said. The reusable suit is a brainchild of Mr. Jose, who led his troops in counter- terror operations at sub-zero temperatures in Jammu and Kashmir. The men under him were clad with three inners, uniforms, jackets and ‘parka’ coats while walking in four-five feet of snow. Realising the difficulties faced by them, Mr. Jose started a research to develop a new vest that can stop the chill, while being comfortable and light. Even after he was shifted to Chennai, he continued the research. The RAF is being deployed in many places to enforce the lockdown and assist the police and health workers. “We purchased the PPE kits from the market and found that they were made of non-woven fabric which does not stop water. If water can penetrate, viruses can also penetrate. I visualised a microbial protective suit that can prevent any virus and water leak... Later, we developed the suit and tested it on 30 people in each company,” Mr. Jose said. The materials were presented to the Tamil Nadu Health Department, and the suit was approved by the South India Textile Research Association. The suit is made of three pieces — one is the shoe cover which extends up to the knee, the other is the upper portion and the another is a trouser. The normal PPE is made of non-woven fabric, which is uncomfortable to wear. But the microbial preventive suit is made of high quality woven cloth, and contains no cotton to ensure the suit is not heavy. “It can be easily sanitised with soap water...so that the novel coronavirus is destroyed immediately,” the officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/crpf-develops-reusable-protective-suit-for-covid-warriors/article32939516.ece
25 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. to roll out house site allocation scheme for encroachers in Dec.||The Tamil Nadu government is set to roll out in December a scheme for purchasing private patta land and assigning it as house sites to several thousands of families living on encroached land. A total of 4,09,676 housing encroachments have been identified and classified into six categories — Unobjectionable and regularisable at the district level; regularisable with the consent of a local body; regularisable after reclassification with special orders of the government; temple land (temple poromboke and land where the patta is in the name of the temple) intended to be purchased by the government subject to the decisions on writ petitions; objectionable poromboke land other than water courses; and objectionable water course poromboke land. As many as 1,91,991 such objectionable encroachments have been identified on temple land, water courses and other land across the State. In a note sent out earlier this month, Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam directed the Collectors to give priority to the regularisation of the first three categories by November since the scheme would be launched by the Chief Minister in the first week of December. A week after, a patta distribution mela would be organised by the district administration at the grassroots. The encroachments in the corporation areas would be dealt with separately as the regularisation proposal had to be examined on a case-by-case basis by the State Committee. Special scheme The government announced the special scheme to ensure housing sites for all families living on the encroached poromboke land for many years by regularising the sites on unobjectionable land. Families living in objectionable poromboke land would be relocated to alternative places while clearing the encroachments and restoring the land for its original purpose. As for the encroachments on temple poromboke land, work would start to earmark sub-divisions and arriving at the land cost as per the government norms. Subject to the outcome of the writ petitions, further instructions will be issued for purchase, reclassification and distribution of patta. The Chief Secretary said, “Existing suitable unobjectionable porombokes may be identified in the vicinity for the purpose of resettlement. If no suitable poromboke land available, private patta lands can be identified and acquired by private negotiation to be assigned as house sites to the relocated families.” The Collectors were told to identify such suitable patta land, assess the cost and send separate proposals to the government through the Commissioner of Land Administration for allotment of money for buying the land through private negotiations. Further, where the encroachment is for an aggregate of more than 25 cents, the land should be alienated to the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board for taking up construction of multi-storey apartments to accommodate all the families that have encroached on such land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-to-roll-out-house-site-allocation-scheme-for-encroachers-in-dec/article32939072.ece
25 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Ready to take battle to court: VCK chief||Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) leader and Chidambaram MP Thol. Thirumavalavan on Saturday said he was ready to take the battle to the court to decide whether it was his party or the Hindu religious text, Manusmriti , which was demeaning women. He alleged that his remarks had been twisted and this was done intentionally to break the DMK-led alliance and gain political mileage. “I spoke for 40 minutes at the web-based conference organised last month by the European Union Periyar Ambedkar Comrades’ Federation. Only 40 seconds of that speech has been taken and twisted by communal forces. I request women to listen to the entire speech. It has been nearly a month since I gave the speech,” he told reporters, after leading the party’s protest at Valluvar Kottam here, demanding a ban on Manusmriti . The fight against Manusmriti was started by Periyar, M.C. Rajah and Dr. Ambedkar, and the VCK is taking it forward, he said. Mr. Thirumavalavan said the AIADMK government had directed the police to book a case against him just to please the BJP government at the Centre. “The BJP has no right to celebrate Dr. Ambedkar. I thank leaders of all our alliance parties for voicing their support for me,” he added. DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday asserted that communal forces would not succeed in driving a wedge into the DMK-led alliance by targeting Mr. Thirumavalavan for his comments against Manusmriti . In a statement in Chennai, he demanded the withdrawal of the case against Mr. Thirumavalavan, saying that he had expressed only what was preached by Dr. Ambedkar and Periyar E.V. Ramasamy.  ‘Vengeance of police’ “A case has been filed under six sections and it shows the vengeance and partial approach of the police under the control of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami,” he said. “Mr. Thirumavalavan has only reiterated the ideas propagated by Dr. Ambedkar and Periyar. He citedManu Dharma to explain how women were denied their rights in the country,” Mr. Stalin said. He said communal forces had posted a distorted version of Mr. Thirumavalavan’s speech. “Instead of taking action against the communal forces that are keen on inciting violence, the police have filed a case against Mr. Thirumavalavan,” he said. Talking about the issue, former Union Minister P. Chidambaram tweeted: “There can be two opinions on a speech, whether it is right or wrong. How can it become a criminal case? Should we keep reminding that there is freedom of speech, on a daily basis?” He wondered if rationalist leader Periyar E V Ramasamy, who too held similar views, would be booked by the police if he had made such comments now? CPI(M) politburo member G. Ramakrishnan contended that Manusmriti had a lot of aspects that demeaned women, the Backward Castes and indigenous groups, and urged the police to withdraw the case. MDMK general secretary Vaiko said Mr. Thirumavalavan had high regard for women and had pointed out the demeaning ways in which Manusmriti talked about women. MMK president M.H. Jawahirullah also called for withdrawal of the case.  Only 40 seconds of the speech has been taken and twisted by communal forces.

Jaganmohan Reddy congratulating him for establishing 56 Backward Class corporations and appointing heads to those bodies. “I have learnt that 29 corporations are going to be led by women (more than 50%) and 12 directors have been appointed for each corporation, representing all 13 districts. I appreciate the fact that you have taken this right decision, at the right time, to uphold social justice and ensure social development,” he said in the letter.

In their complaint, Julian Abraham and Deepa Lucia Julian said they had booked a flat in the project ‘Chaitanya’ in Perambur, Chennai, in 2011, jointly developed by PVP Ventures Ltd. (land owner) and North Town Estates Pvt. Ltd. (the developer). The sale consideration was about Rs. 92.51 lakh and the complainants had paid about Rs. 64.24 lakh. After nine years, the construction was not completed and the flat was not handed over to them. They, therefore, sought a refund. PVP Ventures said its obligation is restricted only to the issues relating to the title of the project land and to execute the sale deed in respect of the UDS land and all the payments were made to North Town Estates. It said the allegations were directed towards North Town Estates and sought dismissal of the complaint against it. In its response, North Town Estates said the complainants were the investors in the project and were not entitled to make a complaint before TNRERA. The complainants were commercial investors in the project and not allottees as per definition of RERA Act, it added and sought dismissal of the complaint. TNRERA noted as per section 2(d) of the RERA Act, allottee meant the person to whom a plot, apartment or building had been allotted, sold or transferred by the promoter, and rejected the contention that the complainants were commercial investors and not allottees. It said PVP Ventures could not contend that it was not answerable to the buyers. The Authority directed the respondents to refund the amount along with interest of 10.05% per annum, compensation of Rs. 2 lakh towards mental agony and Rs. 25,000 as litigation cost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rera-act-applicable-to-all-buyers-rules-regulator/article32939633.ece

25 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Guests gift onions to newly-weds||A newly-wed couple were surprised when their friends gifted them 3 kg of onions at their wedding reception in Arani near Ponneri on Friday. Sheeba Suvitha from Tiruvottiyur, a nurse in the Ponneri Government Hospital on Friday got married to Senthil Kumar, an engineer. Many guests gave them gifts and congratulated the couple at the wedding reception in the evening. “My friends from RSRM Hospital Hemalatha, Bharathi, Atulya and Ezhilarasi, Mohana and Raji from Ponneri Government Hospital also gave me a gift. It was packed like a bouquet and had a bow on top. Initially, I thought it had flowers but I was shocked to find onions,” said Ms. Sheeba, who added that her husband was also amused. Prior to her posting in Tiruvottiyur, Ms. Sheeba worked as nurse at the Government RSRM Hospital in Royapuram. Since the couple were on the stage, they could not react. “After the function, I laughed my guts out,” added Ms. Sheeba. Ms. Hemalatha, a counsellor at the RSRM Hospital, said that on Friday, after the marriage, everyone was discussing the price of onions. “It had touched Rs. 125 a kg. We decided to give 3 kg and purchased it from a shop. We packed and gifted them.” Ms. Hemalatha said more than the couple, their families were amused. “In a lighter vein, they asked why they did not get some for them too. They said it was a very useful gift, considering the current price of onions,” said Ms. Hemalatha. The gift would remain etched in the memory of the couple and their families, she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/guests-gift-onions-to-newly-weds/article32939638.ece
25 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A time to ramp up defences and stay prepared||If the West is apprehensive of the approaching winter and flu season in view of a second wave of COVID-19, here, it is the case of the impending festival season that has authorities anxious about super-spreader events and rising cases. As the number of COVID-19 cases has shown a declining trend in the recent weeks, the Health Secretary has written to district officials, cautioning them against complacency during this crucial phase. Pointing to a resurgence in cases in Europe, J. Radhakrishnan urged officials not to let their guard down as the battle, ostensibly, still rages on. A lower number of cases has been registered after conducting around 80,000 RT-PCR tests a day in the State, with the daily count staying around 3,000. And as far as the capital is concerned, the numbers have consistently remained under the 1,000-mark. For a project that has been on mission mode for nearly seven months, chances that the guard in the fight against COVID-19 has been lowered, as a result of fatigue or a belief that the worst is over, are high. It is necessary that leaders of the campaign are aware of this possibility and ensure that there is no let-up in the efforts. Dr. Radhakrishnan’s note could not have come at a better time, public health experts say. In his letter to District Collectors and health officials, the Health Secretary stressed the need for tracking the case fatality rate and positivity rate; linking fever camps based on need, hospital occupancy and the absolute number of fresh cases, and continuing with the high number of tests. He also emphasised the need for people to continue following protocols, including wearing of masks, hand hygiene and distancing. Former Corporation health officer P. Kuganantham said the attention paid to senior citizens needed to be ramped up because this was key to achieving a low fatality rate. “Data shows that 96%-97% deaths are among senior citizens and people with co-morbidities. We need to ensure that the elderly continue to follow protocols in order to be shielded from possible infection among any other member in the family,” he said. Prabhdeep Kaur, Deputy Director, Indian Council of Medical Research - National Institute of Epidemiology, expressed concerns about a fall in mask compliance. She stressed the need to continue adhering to protocols, especially mask wearing and maintenance of distancing. Crowd control, especially during the festival season, is very important, she added. Surveillance must be enhanced in markets and commercial areas to ensure that crowds do not gather and set off other clusters, she said. The note to district officials also laid emphasis on monitoring market places to ensure masking as they can turn into super spreaders. The Health Secretary also suggested the setting up of information kiosks at places frequented by people during the festival season to prevent a spike in infections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-time-to-ramp-up-defences-and-stay-prepared/article32939075.ece

25 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Gang cheating people under pretext of doing exorcism busted||The Washermenpet police busted a gang which cheated several persons under the pretext of performing special exorcism poojas. Four suspects, including two women, were arrested and a search is still on to nab the prime accused, a self-styled godman from Tiruvallur district. The police identified those arrested as Amarnath, 24, of Kasimedu; Suresh, 34, of Arakkonam; Jayanthi, 29, of Kodungaiyur; and Pappa, 54, of Madurai. A special team led by Julius Caesar, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Washermenpet, began investigations after the owner of a mini-truck from Tenkasi complained that a gang had cheated him to the tune of Rs. 2 lakh by saying they would exorcise him of an evil spirit. K. Rajakumaran, 45, of Meenatchipuram in Tenkasi district, recently met a man, who was pretending to be a godman, in his village. He said his family was in the grip of evil spirits and that he could ward them off for Rs. 2 lakh. Mr. Rajakumaran sold his mini-truck for Rs. 5 lakh. He and his father-in-law arrived in Chennai with the promised amount. They were escorted by the self-styled godman and his associates in a car. The suspects took them near the Government Stanley Hospital, where they took the money and left claiming that they would buy the items for the ritual. But they never returned. Mr. Rajakumaran lodged a complaint with the police. On scrutinising the call records of the suspects, the police identified the main suspect as Yuvaraj, 42, from Putlur, Tiruvallur. “He was in touch with another family in Velachery and intended to cheat them in a similar manner. Sensing trouble, he sent his associates to the house while he was waiting in a car. His associates were nabbed but Yuvaraj escaped,” a senior police officer said. Explaining the modus operandi of the gang, the officer said, “The main suspect would deploy his associates to scout for potential victims in random villages. After his associates zero in on potential victims, the main suspect would offer help to solve their troubles by performing poojas. They seem to have cheated multiple people.”  After his associates zero in on potential victims, the main suspect would offer help to solve their troubles by performing poojas Senior Police officer||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gang-cheating-people-under-pretext-of-doing-exorcism-busted/article32939496.ece

Red alert As of October 24, Vazhani and Peechi reservoirs in Thrissur and Walayar, Malampuzha and Mangalam reservoirs in Palakkad are in red alert. In Vazhani, for instance, the Kerala Irrigation Department, as per data available in public domain, has water level at 62.13 m as against the full reservoir level of 62.48. In the nearby Malampuzha reservoir, the Department has let the water level touch 114.5m. The full reservoir level is 115.06m. In addition to the five ‘red alert’ reservoirs, Kerala has put two reservoirs in orange alert category and one in blue alert category. But in Siruvani, it has maintained water level at 90% of the storage level, which is 1.67m below the full reservoir level. The Kerala Government reducing water level in Siruvani comes even as the Tamil Nadu Government has been taking efforts to have the water level increased to the full reservoir level. The Tamil Nadu Government through the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board has been saying that the Siruvani Reservoir is a drinking water lifeline for Coimbatore city and that the reduction of 1.67m or thereabout equals around a month’s supply to the city. But the Kerala Government has not yet ceded space, say the Board sources, adding that the organisation is hopeful that Kerala will see merit in its argument.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kerala-unrelenting-on-raising-storage-in-siruvani-reservoir/article32939521.ece
25 October 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Having cleared NEET, she wants to be a gynaecologist||A student of the S.S. Kulam Government Higher Secondary School in Coimbatore, who cleared the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) with 361 marks out of 720, has emerged topper among government school students in the district. M. Gnanamsoundharya told The Hindu on Saturday that she did not attend private coaching classes. She prepared using the State Board textbooks, with occasional references to National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) textbooks for Classes XI and XII. “I began preparing for NEET only after completing the Class XII public examinations,” she said. Previous year question papers and support from the school teachers aided her preparation. She attended the online NEET crash course organised by the Department of School Education for about 10 days in June and later quit because the teaching pace was “a little fast” for her. “I was satisfied after writing the examination, but I could not believe that I came first in the district among the government school students,” Ms. Gnanamsoundharya said. She aspires to become a gynaecologist. According to her mother Muthukala, the girl’s father worked as a labourer in a factory at Vaiyampalayam. Five years ago he met with an accident and after that he was not able to go to work regularly. “We have supported our daughter to the maximum extent,” she said, as she expressed happiness over her daughter’s achievement. Headmistress of the S.S. Kulam Government Higher Secondary School R. Sridevi said that Ms. Gnanamsoundharya was among the four students from the school who cleared NEET 2020. “She is a hard worker,” the headmistress said, adding that her medical seat might get confirmed if the 7.5% horizontal reservation for government school students was approved. If she does not get through, the school teachers and some donors are planning to fund her private coaching at a Namakkal-based institute to help her score better in NEET next year, Ms. Sridevi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/neet-topper-among-govt-schools-in-coimbatore-district-aspires-to-become-a-gynaecologist/article32939112.ece

At the time of the issuing the orders, the Tangedco had quoted the Court order in writ petition 14520 of 2017 and the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019. Now that the Court had stayed the October 6 circular, the Tangedco must start insisting on building completion certificate from those seeking power connection. But that is not the end of story. The stay also has a message for local bodies, says Coimbatore Consumer Cause Secretary K. Kathirmathiyon. “What applies to the Tangedco also applies to local bodies in demanding building completion certificate but for giving water and sewerage connection.” Sadly, the local bodies do not insist on completion certificate, though. And, worse, they do not issue completion certificate, either, he says and refers to a Coimbatore Corporation letter to the Tangedco that said that the civic body assessing building for property tax was as good as having issued completion certificate. Mr. Kathirmathiyon, who filed the petition to stay the October 6 Tangedco circular, says when the Court hears his petition he will point out that the local bodies that ought to issue the completion certificate have not followed the Rules and the difference between the Tangedco and local bodies was that the former attempted violation of the Rule by issuing a circular and the latter has violated the Rule without any circular. Besides, the local bodies issuing water and sewerage connection without the completion certificate is contempt of the Court. He further says that the very reason that the State Government framed the Rules is to prevent construction of illegal buildings as no builder likes to construct a building that will not have power, water or sewer connection. By ignoring the Rule, the local body has started treating violators on a par with those who construct as per rules, he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-stay-on-tangedco-circular-is-a-message-for-local-bodies/article32939519.ece

25 October 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Ailing sloth bear dies||An ailing sloth bear that was rescued by the Forest Department from a private land within the limits of Madukkarai forest range on Friday died in the early hours of Saturday. According to officials, the bear was very weak, due to age-related ailments, at the time of rescue and it died around 1.30 a.m. on Saturday. The bear, aged around 15, was found lying on a private land behind the Karunya Nagar police station around 4 p.m. on Friday. Forest staff found that the bear was unable to move its hind portion due to which it could not walk. Among the set of teeth, the omnivore had lost most of its incisors and canines. The animal was moved to a cage and shifted to the Chadivayal elephant camp for treatment. Veterinarians examined the bear and removed maggots from its wounds. Later they administered glucose, antibiotics, vitamins and other drugs, officials said. The medication, however, could not revive the animal. The carcass was autopsied at the elephant camp on Saturday morning after which it was burnt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ailing-sloth-bear-rescued-near-madukkarai-forest-range-dies/article32939109.ece
25 October 2020||Dindigul,TAMIL NADU||Shallot prices touch a new high||Despite the Central government’s ban on onion export and the State government’s initiative to sell the vegetable through cooperatives, the price refused to fall in the wholesale market at Oddanchatram on Saturday. According to the merchants, the shallots were quoted at Rs. 100 per kg and the big onions were quoted at Rs. 80 per kg. “If this is the rate revolving in the wholesale market, the price will be higher in retail outlets and even higher in private chain stores,” Nagarajan, a farmer from Gujiliamparai said. With rainfall continuing in many States from where onions arrive, the price may not come down for the next month or two, Muthu, a merchant said. At least a dozen merchants sell onions - big and small at the uzhavar sandhai here. However, with prices sky-rocketing only five traders had onions. The total arrival at the sandhai was just 600 kilos of shallots and 700 kilos of big onions. Though there were not many takers for the produce at this price, the Agriculture department official at the sandai said that people may buy at this rate as the prices may only look upwards till Deepavali. With farmers' in Gujiliamparai, Yeriodu and Vedasandur having just commenced their crop activities, the harvest may happen only in mid or third week of January 2021. Until then, the prices may be revolving around Rs. 80 and above, the farmers say. Speaking to The Hindu , a Horticulture officer in Kodaikanal said that the government may increase onion imports from Egypt soon and prices would come down to around Rs. 50 per kg and hoped that the Cooperative stores would sell them in large quantities ensuring that there was no artificial demand. Another senior officer in Oddanchatram said that they have appealed to the wholesale merchants not to hoard the commodity as the imported onion was already available in cities like Madurai, where they were being sold at Rs. 40 per kg.

Talks held Erode Revenue Divisional Officer Saibudeen held talks with the members and assured them that no works would be taken up on the farmlands until a decision was taken. But, farmers said that recently officials began survey works in their land and termed it as violation of the agreement. They also said that inviting farmers for inquiry on October 27 at Tahsildar office is a mistake and a violation of the agreement. Hence, Modakurichi Tahsildar S. Shankar Ganesh organised a meeting on October 24 and asked the federation members to participate. But, urging the administration to give up land acquisition and the inquiry, farmers refused to participate in the meeting.

25 October 2020||Kodaikanal,TAMIL NADU||Duo jailed for cheating contractor||Police arrested Sanjeevi (63) and Immanuel (32) under charges of cheating a building contractor to the tune of Rs. 40 lakh on Saturday. Following a complaint from Jeeva (58), a building contractor here, Superintendent of Police Priya Ravali directed the police to register a case. The complaint was that the father and son duo had lured Jeeva by saying that they would get him a big contract worth Rs. 200 crore in Maldives. In a bid to make him fall in the trap, they even allegedly assured to get him a bank loan arranged in Maldives through financial consultants. To make the complainant believe, the father and son had made a few people from Maldives to hold a conference with Jeeva. As a first step, they wanted him to part with Rs. 40 lakh, which he had given on different dates. As the accused were evading calls from Jeeva, he turned suspicious and approached the police after having come to know their real intention, Inspector Satya and SI of Police Sekar Poulraj said and added that Sanjeevi and his son were produced before a court, which remanded them in judicial custody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-held-for-cheating-contractor/article32939054.ece
25 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Safety norms were violated at cracker unit: PESO team||Rajalakshmi Fireworks near T. Kallupatti where a fire accident claimed seven lives on Friday was found to have blatantly violated safety rules by allowing too many workers and illegally making aerial fireworks. A team of officials from Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), Sivakasi, on Saturday inspected the scene of accident. “The major violation in the unit, licensed by District Revenue Officer, was that it employed more workers than the permitted number,” Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives, R. Sundaresan said. The unit has two mound walls and two working sheds. Each mound wall can have only two employees and each working shed can have four workers. “It means the unit could have employed a maximum of 12 workers whereas there were at least 35 workers at the time of accident,” he added. Allowing too many workers had led to increased death toll. Other major violation was that the shed had been used by multiple leases. “We have found labels of at least two fireworks companies on the premises of the unit. Only one entity is allowed to operate the unit under Explosives Rules,” Mr. Sundaresan said. Since different companies had deployed their workers, the crowded employees had been working under the shade of trees whereas they are supposed to work within the working sheds. They had also violated the safety norms by unauthorised stocking of finished and semi-finished goods at different places like the office room and laboratory. While the units licensed by DRO have limited facilities, they were allowed to manufacture very limited types and quantity of fireworks. However, here they were making aerial and fancy fireworks goods violating the license conditions. PESO would send its report to Madurai district administration for further action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/safety-norms-were-violated-at-cracker-unit-peso-team/article32939588.ece
25 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Prices of flowers soar at market||Prices of most of the flowers soared up at the flower market at Mattuthavani here on Saturday, ahead of Ayudha puja and Vijayadashami festivals. However, there was a fall in the price of jasmine mainly due to higher yield of the flower. It was sold for Rs. 1,000 a kg on Friday. The prices of flowers such as arali, sevvanthi, sampangi and mullai had doubled on Saturday. S. Ramachandran, president of Madurai Meenakshi Sundareswarar Malar Makkal Nala Sangam, said a kg of jasmine was sold at Rs. 800 a kg on Saturday morning, but gradually the price fell to Rs. 500 by the evening. “The main reason for the fall in price is because the supply of jasmine on Saturday was at least three times higher when compared to Friday,” Mr. Ramachandran said. K. Sasikumar, a jasmine farmer from Usilampatti, said the yield of jasmine was lower during last week due to rains, resulting in the spike in the price of the flower last week. “However, it is disappointing that the price of jasmine dropped on Saturday, ahead of the festival. Many farmers suffered huge losses during the COVID-19 pandemic when jasmine was sold for a paltry sum,” he said. While there was a good crowd at the flower market on Saturday, the sales were not brisk when compared to previous years, said M. Sundar, a flower vendor. Concurring with this viewpoint, K. Mahalakshmi, a retail flower seller at K. Pudur, expressed concern over spiralling prices of many flowers. “The COVID-19 pandemic had reduced the purchasing capacity of many customers. Nevertheless, I have to increase the selling price of the flowers,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/prices-of-flowers-soar-at-market/article32939580.ece

25 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC denies bail to accused in Gokul Raj murder case||Taking into account that the trial in the Gokulraj murder case was at a crucial stage, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court dismissed the criminal appeals preferred by six accused facing trial in the case. The accused had challenged the dismissal of their bail applications by the III Additional Sessions Judge, Madurai. Justice R. Tharani took cognisance of the fact that the court in 2019 had dismissed similar criminal appeals preferred by the four accused in the case. The court observed that out of the 116 witnesses, 86 were already examined and most of the witnesses yet to be examined were only official witnesses. The Supreme Court has already passed an order to complete the trial in the case within a prescribed time limit. In view of the fact that connected bail petitions were dismissed by various courts and considering the order of the Supreme Court, releasing the accused on bail at this stage may cause delay in the disposal of the case, the court said. “It is seen that the offence is grave in nature. Whether there is any overt act against the appellants and whether there is any evidence against them cannot be decided before the completion of the trial. The alleged motive for the occurrence is communal hatred which is against the Constitution,” the judge observed and dismissed the criminal appeals. The appeals were preferred by Sathishkumar, Sridhar, Ranjith, Suresh, Giridhar and Prabhu facing trial in the murder case. The Madras High Court transferred the trial in the case to Madurai based on a petition filed by the mother of Gokul Raj. She apprehended that she might not get justice if the trial was conducted in Namakkal, under hostile circumstances. The body of Gokul Raj, belonging to a Scheduled Caste community, was found on a railway track near Pallipalayam, Namakkal district, on June 24, 2015. The youth’s mother alleged that her son was murdered for being in a relationship with a caste Hindu girl.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-denies-bail-to-accused-in-gokul-raj-murder-case/article32939575.ece

25 October 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Union Territory records sharp decline in COVID-19 cases||With COVID-19 cases showing a sharp decline, the Puducherry Health Department will soon start relieving some private medical colleges from treating novel coronavirus infected patients and retain the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Research Institute as the main treatment centre. Saturday saw the second biggest drop in cases with 128 new admissions registered in the Union Territory. Of the new admissions, the Puducherry region recorded 103 cases. In the last 24 hours, two COVID- 19 deaths were reported while 187 patients were discharged from various hospitals. Currently, there are3,912active cases, including2,335under home quarantine. So far, the Union Territory has reported 586 deaths,34,112total cases and as manyas 29,614patients have been treated and discharged. ‘Guard to be maintained’ “We are seeing a sharp decline in the last few days. But we are not going to lessen the guard or withdraw any healthcare workers from COVID-19 related work. However, we will slowly relieve private medical colleges from treating infected patients,” S. Mohan Kumar, Director of Health and Family Welfare Services, told The Hindu . After a sharp drop in new admissions and an increase in recovery rate, around 40% of beds are vacant at the medical college. In the coming days, PHCs will stop referring patients to private institutes. But these institutes would have to maintain a minimum bed strength for treating COVID-19 patients in case of a resurgence in persons getting infected, he said. “In the present context, we think our medical college, along with Jipmer, can handle the new admissions. The virus is still around and so people will have to be very cautious, especially during the festival season. If people continue to observe protocols, we can get very good results in the next 60 days,” Mr. Kumar said. The Director said there would not be any let down in the number of samples being tested per day. The numbers would be maintained around4,000a day, he said, adding that the department would be touching the 3-lakh mark soon with respect to the number of people tested. In 24 hours alone,3,865people got tested for the virus, taking the total number of those screened in the Union Territory to2,85,824.The recovery rate had increased to86. 81%, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/union-territory-records-sharp-decline-in-covid-19-cases/article32939243.ece
25 October 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK MLA opposes move to shift Sunday market||AIADMK floor leader A. Anbalagan on Saturday said he would not allow the Puducherry government to shift the Sunday market to his constituency. Addressing a press conference here, he said the move would pave the way for a resurgence of COVID- 19 cases in his constituency. Besides, the stretch near the Railway station, where the government was planning to shift the Sunday market, was not suitable to accommodate large gatherings. There is a famous church and temple in the vicinity. The coming together of a large number of people would create inconvenience to the devotees, he said, adding that he would not allow the market to be shifted to his constituency at any cost. “I am ready to take the responsibility for the law and order situation it may bring,” he added. Flaying the government for the delay in bringing legislation to obtain 50% of medical seats in private medical colleges under the government quota, Mr. Anbalgan said the Congress government had always taken a stand against the interests of students. While several States had not implemented the 10% reservation policy for the economically weaker sections, the Union Territory was the first to implement the policy. The decision to implement the quota had deprived students hailing from socially marginalised sections to get admission into professional courses, Mr. Anbalagan said.  I will not allow the market to be shifted to my constituency at any cost. I am ready to take the responsibility for the law and order situation it may bring A.

25 October 2020||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Central team visits Delta region||A team of officials from Central Government organisations visited a few direct purchase centres (DPCs) of the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation in the delta districts on Friday to “assess the ground realities” with respect to the procurement of paddy. The team’s visit comes in the wake of the recommendation made by the State government to the Centre to enhance the limit of moisture content in the paddy procured at the DPCs to 22% from the current level of 17%. The team inspected the procurement process at the DPCs located in the newly-formed Mayiladuthurai district and proceeded to Thanjavur district where they inspected the process in the old Cauvery Delta areas before winding up the day’s proceedings at Ammapettai Union area on the border of Thanjavur-Tiruvarur districts. During the inspection, the team comprising officials from the organisations coming under the umbrella of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution collected data relating to the extent of paddy affected due to rain in the delta districts. The team is expected to inspect the procurement process in Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts on Sunday. G. Srinivasan of Ganapathi Agraharam, a progressive farmer, urged the State government to prevail upon the Central team to make a recommendation to the Union government that relaxation in moisture content be extended for the paddy to be procured during the rainy season, permanently. Seeking relaxation every year would delay the procurement process and also cause immense hardship to the farmers, he added. A.K.R. Ravichandar, president, Cauvery Delta Farmers Association, urged the State government to instruct the DPC staff to procure the `kuruvai’ paddy from the farmers without fail even if the moisture content was above 17%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/central-team-visits-delta-districts/article32939053.ece

25 October 2020||Thoothukudi,TAMIL NADU||People throng flower markets, poor sale in grocery shops||Throwing the mandatory safety protocols to the wind, people thronged the flower markets in the city for shopping ahead of Saraswathi and Ayudha Pooja celebrations here on Saturday. The prices of flowers, including jasmine and button rose, touched a new high in the Kamarajar and VOC Markets. Hundreds of farmers from Srivaikundam, Eral, Sawyerpuram, Kulayankarisal, Kurumbur, Alwartirunagari and among other pockets brought in their produce from early morning onwards. Other than the flowers, decorative items and puja materials were selling at a fancy price, Nagarajan, a flower merchant, said and added that jasmine was the most expensive flower. Though the markets had good arrivals, the demand was also very high, he added. With people rushing to the flower markets, there was relatively less activity in bazaar areas, where many wholesale and retail grocers had little sales throughout the day, Vincent, a dhal merchant, said and added that until Deepavali, the sales may not be very brisk as customers would go for textile and cracker shopping. Though the police were visible in the markets, they were unable to stop people who were not wearing face masks. The outlets in the VOC Market too were packed heavily till 11 a.m., and many of the farmers and merchants too were not wearing the mask, a sanitary inspector from the health department of Thoothukudi Corporation said and added that the civic authorities made announcements through public address system at vantage locations, but these appeared to have fallen on deaf ears. A medical officer at the Thoothukudi GH said that there were fever cases coming in from a few wards in the Corporation limits and it showed that there was an urgent need for self-discipline among all residents. Any negligence, may see a surge in COVID-19, he apprehended and hoped the people extended their fullest cooperation for the next 60 days. In a press release, Collector Sandeep Nanduri said on Saturday that the residents should stay indoors and avoid crowding. In the event of stepping out, he appealed to the people to wear face masks and adhere to physical distancing. He also warned that stern action would be taken against erring shopkeepers under the Disaster Management Act and showrooms sealed, if they failed to follow safety protocol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-throng-flower-markets-poor-sale-in-grocery-shops/article32939626.ece

25 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Gandhi Market traders call off stir plan||A section of traders of Gandhi Market, who had decided to go on a three-day strike to press for reopening of the market from Sunday, has decided to call off the stir. A decision to this effect was taken at an emergency meeting of traders held at G. Corner on Saturday. M.K. Kamalakannan, one of the traders who took part in the meeting, said Collector had spelled out the stand of the State government in a written document, which was to be submitted in the High Court. The main demands of traders have been conceded in the document. So, it had been decided to call off the strike call. Urging the State government to take steps to vacate the interim injunction against reopening the Gandhi Market, a group of wholesale and retail traders of the market, who operate from G. Corner, had announced suspension of business for three days from Sunday. Ve. Govindarajulu, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangangalim Peravappu, who presided over a meeting of traders a few days ago, said the protest was aimed at pressing the State government to take steps to vacate the interim injunction. He claimed that 27 associations of Gandhi Market had supported the strike call. However, the strike call did not evoke support from all traders. A section of vegetable and fruits traders came out in the open stating that they would not take part in the agitation, citing the “inapprorpriate” timing of the strike call. S.P. Babu, president, Tiruchi district, Kaikani Vyaparigal Otrumai Sangam, said that there was no need for such an agitation when Deepavali was round the corner. The State government was for reopening the Gandhi Market. The strike would hit the people hard during the festival season. It was not correct to hold agitation when the High Court was handling the matter. Mr. Babu said on Saturday that his association had about 600 members. They would continue to do business as usual. Earlier, revenue, corporation and police officials held a peace talk with traders for the second consecutive day on Saturday. Collector S. Sivarasu on Friday assured traders that “suitable action” on vacating the interim stay would be taken and urged the traders to withdraw the agitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gandhi-market-traders-call-off-stir-plan/article32939047.ece

25 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Farmer takes organic route to raise grapes||A farmer of Perambalur has successfully raised a vineyard by cultivating the ‘paneer’ variety of grapes adopting organic practices. It was a successful return to grape cultivation for R.Perumal, 47, alias Surulirajan whose vineyard was destroyed in heavy rain and flash floods in 2005. He gave up the crop but has raised it again on about 30 cents on his four-acre land after attending a training programme on organic farming and sustainable practices organised by GREAT, a voluntary organisation, with support from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) under its capacity building for adoption of technology initiative. Mr.Surulirajan, Managing Director, GREAT Perambalur Farmers Producers Company, had taken up grape cultivation in 1999 after seeing vineyards during his travel to different parts of the state and country as a truck driver. “I had raised a vineyard then too though I had been using chemical fertilizers. Last year, I decided to cultivate grapes adopting organic methods. Not only the attempt was successful but fruits are also tasty,” he says. With vineyard located close to the Perambalur-Athur Road on Esanai, many people flock to his vineyard to purchase the fruits. He has used shade nets on the sides and bird nets on top of his vineyard. He had to make an initial investment of about Rs. 2 lakhs. There is not much recurring investment except for organic inputs and labour. He has installed a micro irrigation system to irrigate the crop from his well. The crop can continue to yield up to 25 years if it was well taken care of. On an average, fruits can be harvested five times every two years. He has recovered his investment after two harvests. “I get a yield of about 2.5 tonnes and make a profit of about Rs. 2 lakhs after every harvest,” he said. He is going to raise the crop in another 50 cents. He says farmers can cultivate grapes by adopting organic methods. Collector V.Santha, who inspected his vineyard and a fertilizer retail outlet run by the Great FPO, urged officials to sensitise farmers to organic farming. Many farmers have come forward to take up grapes cultivation, said L.S.Naveenkumar, District Development Manager, NABARD, Perambalur. “We plan to support about 15 to 20 farmers on a project mode towards increasing area of coverage under the crop in the district,” he said. NABARD has extended support two FPOs in Perambalur district and extended a grant of Rs. 11.4 lakhs each. The GREAT FPO has a fertilizer, seed and pesticide outlet at Esanai after obtaining requisite licences.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmer-takes-the-organic-route-to-raise-grapes/article32939056.ece

It was a good day of business for flower vendors at the Srirangam market as they made good sales after complaining for weeks about lack of sales. ‘We earned more this year than we did last year.

25 October 2020||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||‘Crimes against weaker sections have risen’||Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, the weaker sections in many districts of Tamil Nadu were attacked, said All India Congress Committee secretary Sunil Dutt here on Saturday. Speaking to reporters, he said that the poor handling of the pandemic by the Central government had claimed many lives. When Congress leader Rahul Gandhi warned about the virus spread and urged the BJP led government to take precautions, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi neglected, he charged. Utilising the COVID-19 pandemic, the Scheduled Castes were targeted and exploited. It was unfortunate that the AIADMK government had not taken an iron hand against the attackers. The Bihar election rallies were an indication that people wanted a change. The meetings of the Congress showed that the alliance would win hands down. This will be a beginning and soon, the Congress would be in power in all the poll-bound States. Taking a dig at the BJP, Mr. Dutt went on to say that all the institutions built by the Congress in the past had been sold by the BJP now. No where in the globe well performing public sector undertakings would be sold. The BJP was keen to promote and protect their own "friends"in the corporate world, the Congress leader charged and hence they were "selling" even the airports. Criticising the BJP government for the plight of a rape victim in Hathras village, Uttar Pradesh, he said that the BJP's slogan should be read as "save girl child and women from the BJP leaders...." he lamented and said that the Dalit girl was deprived of even a decent last rites. The people were baffled over the rising prices of essential commodities. Asked to comment on the price rise of onion, he said, even the Prime Minister may be unaware about the rise on prices of onions in the coming days. It was looking upward and may touch the price of yellow metal. The people have started questioning the BJP leaders on the promise made by them in 2019 to bring back the absconders, who had cheated the public sector banks and took shelter abroad after swindling crores of rupees. He lauded the district Congress presidents and functionaries for reaching out to the needy people in the State during the pandemic. He also recalled the yeomen services rendered by late H. Vasantha Kumar in Kanniyakumari. The Congress high command would decide on the candidate at the appropriate time, he replied.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/crimes-have-risen-in-the-state/article32939084.ece

M. Sneha Adriana, a student studying first semester at the Apparel Fashion Design Department, said on Saturday that she was motivated by her teacher G. Boopathi Vijay to attempt Picasso’s ‘Guernica’, one of his most recognised works. While the original work painted in 1937 was done on canvas with dimensions 3.49 m x 7.76 m, she said that her recreation was done on multiple chart papers stuck together to get a reduced dimension of 3.49 ft x 7.76 ft. The work took eight days to complete, with three days only for recreating the outlines of the original painting. “Through recreating this work, I learned that Picasso embraced imperfections and that it is possible to convey multiple emotions using only a few colours,” Ms. Adriana said. Mr. Vijay said that the student completed this work at her residence in Tiruchi, from where she has been attending classes online due to the COVID-19 lockdown. “Only those who can understand the painting could recreate it,” he said referring to the complexity of the original work.

According to the police, the trees were located close to the compound wall of the DIG’s office, where offices of other police wings and quarters are located. The premises is spread over 1.5 acres of land. Heavy rain “The suspects might have scaled the walls and jumped in. As it was raining heavily, the suspects used it as a cover and chopped down the tree. The sentry, who was a little far away, did not hear the sound,” said a senior police officer. N. Kamini, Deputy Inspector-General of Police (DIG), Vellore Range, said that this was the first such case after she took charge. “I heard that 10 years ago a similar incident had happened on the premises. We have lodged a complaint with the Forest Department. However, we are also conducting an inquiry. We are compiling a list of people who are involved in such offences,” she said. Forest officials took away the remaining portion of the trees. “The trees were eight years old,” said an officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sandalwood-trees-cut-stolen/article32939241.ece

Right from the morning, a good crowd was seen at Uzhavar Sandhai at Sampath Nagar and also at the retail vegetable and fruit market that functions at VOC Park Ground. Also, R.K.V.

Temporary shops selling puffed rice, banana plants, flowers, fruits, mango leaves, ash gourd, coconuts and sugarcane had come up at various places on the roads and personal distancing norms were flouted in most of the places. Consumers said that the prices of flowers had gone up by over 200% while the price of fruits increased by 50% to 70% on Saturday. Many shoppers pointed out that the flowers were sold at very high prices by the traders to reap good profit affecting the middle and low-income level people. “Traders refuse to give flowers even for Rs. 50”, said a shopper P. Murugesh of Thindal. Most of the roads in market areas witnessed heavy traffic snarls as policemen had a tough time in regulating the crowd and also the traffic. Meanwhile, the Corporation has warned the residents and traders not to break ash gourd and coconuts on the roads which may cause accidents or inconvenience to road users. They said that safety of pedestrians and road users is important and asked people not to break items on the roads.

25 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Flooding: BBMP surveys affected households; puts count at 410||Early on Saturday morning, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) deployed around 200 pourakarmikas at Dattatreya Nagar in Hosakerehalli ward. Earthmovers were also pressed into service to clear silt from the roads. Around 300 households in Dattatreya Nagar, 60 in Kumaraswamy Layout, and around 50 at Dorekere, near Uttarahalli, were flooded after a spate of heavy rain on Friday. BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said the civic body had conducted a ground-level survey to assess the number of households that were affected by the flooding. Residents who have lost most of their belongings have sought more compensation, arguing that the Rs. 25,000 relief announced by the Chief Minister will not cover the loss. Mr. Prasad said the civic body was also distributing food and drinking water to the affected residents. “We will provide meals to the residents on Sunday as well,” he said. However, several residents that The Hindu spoke to claimed that they had received no aid from the civic body, though a few organisations have stepped in to help with relief work. Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Ltd. has also sent kits containing soaps, toothpaste, and toothbrush, and other essential toiletries. These kits were also distributed to the affected families in the flood-affected localities, Mr. Prasad said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/flooding-bbmp-surveys-affected-households-puts-count-at-410/article32939488.ece
25 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||COVID-19: Experts warn of surge in cases post festival if ‘SMS’ isn’t followed||Karnataka is likely to witness another surge in COVID-19 cases in the first half of November, if people do not follow the standard guidelines of SMS (social distancing, masking and santisation) during the festival season, warn experts. Citing Kerala’s surge that happened post Onam, members of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee said social gatherings and visits to native villages for festivals should be strictly avoided. Carrying back and forth “People should avoid going out of the city to villages for the festivals, which they usually do. They should realise that they can either carry the infection there or bring it back with them on return,” said C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force. “With the festival season beginning in the State, this week and coming week are crucial. The ongoing Dasara festivities followed by Eid Milad, Valmiki Jayanthi and Kannada Rajyotsava in the coming week can become potential sources of another surge if people become complacent now,” he said. Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare), said the entire effort of the State in controlling the pandemic could go waste if people do not follow precautions now. “We have been able to see a decline in the number of cases now with great difficulty. The onus is on people now to ensure that the numbers do not go up again,” he said. V. Ravi, Senior Professor and head of the department of Neuro Virology at NIMHANS, who is also part of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee, said going by what happened in Kerala post Onam, the State is likely to experience a second surge in the first half of November. “People should realise that the virus is still lurking around and that the spread can be prevented if people behave responsibly,” he said. Stating that even those who have recovered should be careful, Dr. Ravi said, “There are increasing reports of reinfection among those who have recovered. Some people either do not develop antibodies or the antibodies do not last for long. So people who have been infected and did not develop an appropriate immune response have a risk of reinfection.”  We have been able to see a decline in the number of cases now with great difficulty. The onus is on people now to ensure that the numbers do not go up again.

25 October 2020||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘People in Sira want change and development’||Forty-six-year-old C.M. Rajesh Gowda, who is taking the plunge into politics as BJP candidate in the byelection to Sira Assembly constituency, says the development of this backward constituency is his main poll agenda. The medical practitioner says he has readied a blueprint for development, which will be implemented by the government headed by his party. Excerpts from The Hindu ’s interview with him:  You were a medical practitioner. What brought you to politics?  My father was three-time MP and even my uncle was in politics. However, as a postgraduate in radiology, I focused on the medical field. But my service of patients endeared me to people, who encouraged me to enter public life. Of course, my entry into politics is not sudden as I have engaged in social service, including the refurbishing of government hospitals, strengthening infrastructure in government schools, and providing safe drinking water, for about four years.  Your father was an MP from the Congress. Why did you choose the BJP?  I have been influenced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a long time. The BJP was a natural choice for ideological reasons.  But there was resistance to your candidature from within the BJP local unit?  There was some resistance in the beginning as two other leaders were trying to get ticket. But after the party’s top leadership chose me, they are all supporting and campaigning for me.  What are the main poll issues in Sira?  Development is the main agenda. This constituency is underdeveloped though it is represented by senior leaders. It needs focus on development of infrastructure such as roads and drinking water. Also, there is a dire need to create irrigation facilities in this parched constituency.  What is your plan for the development of the constituency?  I have prepared a blueprint for comprehensive development. This includes laying roads, providing drinking water and filling up Madaluru tank with Hemavati waters. This will also help increase the groundwater table here. I want to focus on industrial development as well, so that youngsters find employment. I can get them implemented through our government in the State.  You are taking on a veteran leader such as T.B. Jayachandra from the Congress and the wife of a prominent grassroots leader like Sathyanarayana from the JD(S). Also, the BJP is yet to register any poll victory here so far. Is it not a tough battle?  No. My initial campaign tour has shown that people here are aspiring for a change as they want development. Since the BJP is in power at both the Centre and the State, development can be achieved only through this party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/people-in-sira-want-change-and-development/article32939131.ece
25 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Flower prices shoot up for Ayudha Puja, Vijayadashami||In a positive reversal of festive trends, markets across the city witnessed brisk business on Saturday, the eve of Ayudha Puja. Vendors said the demand for flowers, ash gourd, and lime was high. This was even though the price of popular flowers had risen considerably — as much 25% — as supply had been affected by the recent spell of rain. G.M. Diwakar, president, K.R. Market Flower Merchants’ Association, said, “Though we have done good business, more than what we expected, the prevailing rain has affected the supply and sales of flowers. Hence, due to the surge in demand, the rates increased.” At K.R. Market for instance, ‘mallige moggu’ (jasmine) was selling at Rs. 800–Rs. 1,000 a kg on Saturday, while ‘kanakambara’ (crossandra) was oscillating between Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 1,100. Vendors were selling ‘kakada’ at Rs. 600–Rs. 650, and roses at Rs. 250–Rs. 300 a kg. The fragrant ‘sugandaraja’ (tuberose) was being sold for around Rs. 400 and ‘sevantige’ (chrysanthemum) at Rs. 200–Rs. 250 a kg. “Most of the flowers come from the outskirts of the city such as Doddaballapur, Chickballapur, Ramanagaram, Gauribidanur, and the incessant rain has affected their quality,” said Mr. Diwakar, adding that ‘kakada’ and ‘mallige’ come from Tamil Nadu. Venkatesh K., a flower vendor at K.R. Puram market, said that both flower growers and vendors were banking on sales ahead of Ayudha Puja and Vijayadashami. “From September 16 to October 16, business was dull. It is picking up and we hope to make some money till Deepavali,” he said. At K.R. Puram market, there was great demand for garlands. A medium-sized ‘sevantige’ garland was selling at Rs. 150. “Compared to the quality of flower, the price is quite high,” a buyer said. Rs. 10-Rs. 15 for lime Items such as banana stems, limes, and ash gourds, which are an integral part of Ayudha Pooja, were of great demand. While the price of ash guord was oscillating between Rs. 40 and Rs. 60 a kg, a single piece of lime was retailing at Rs. 10 to Rs. 15, and a pair of banana stems was going for Rs. 20–Rs. 35. “A medium-sized ash gourd weighs around 4–5 kg and we have seen good business from morning. There will be demand till Sunday noon,” a vendor at K.R. Puram market said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/flower-prices-shoot-up-for-ayudha-puja-vijayadashami/article32939479.ece
25 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Will Bihar outcome influence politics in State?||With speculation rife within the ranks of the ruling BJP that the party’s high command will effect a leadership change in the State after the Bihar Assembly elections, all eyes are now on that State. The outcome of the polls may decide the mood of the high command on the issue, BJP leaders predict.   The fact that the party chief in Karnataka has not even issued a notice to senior MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, who said that B.S. Yediyurappa would not last long as Chief Minister, indicates the high command’s intent, sources said. However, the manner in which the Bihar electoral arena will pan out may have a bearing on the high command’s final call, they added. “Before the campaign began, it was assumed that the National Democratic Alliance would have a cakewalk. But now there are several signals from the campaign trail — crowds thronging Rashtriya Janata Dal rallies and Nitish Kumar being booed at a rally — that the contest has opened up,” a BJP leader said. He argued that if the NDA lost in Bihar, then the scales would likely tilt in favour of strong regional satraps within the BJP, giving Mr. Yediyurappa another chance at survival. It can be recalled that Mr. Yediyurappa was anointed president of the BJP State unit in 2016, paving the way for him to eventually head the government, close on the heels of the BJP’s defeat in the Delhi and Bihar Assembly polls of 2015 — the first major defeats the party had suffered since it came to power in 2014. “In both Delhi and Bihar, the BJP had led the campaign with the face of Narendra Modi and not a strong regional leader. Within the party forum, that was later analysed as one of the reasons for defeat. This helped Mr. Yediyurappa project himself as a regional satrap,” a leader close to the Chief Minister said.   While the faction arguing for a leadership change has been pointing out Mr. Yediyurappa’s age and his inability to lead the next Assembly polls would create a leadership vacuum, the Chief Minister’s faction has been pushing the narrative that there is no alternative leader in the party ranks who can rival his mass base and ability to deliver an election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/will-bihar-outcome-influence-politics-in-state/article32939133.ece
25 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘We are down in the dumps as everything has been lost’||Residents of 300-odd houses at Dattatreya Nagar are reeling from the damage wrought by floodwaters and sewage that entered their houses on Friday after hours of heavy rain. “We have only the clothes on our back. When the raja kaluve overflowed and started flooding our ground floor house, we tried to salvage our children’s books and laptop first. All of us rushed to the terrace,” said Lakshmi N., a resident of Dattatreya Nagar. ‘None came to rescue’ The locality in Hosakerehalli ward was one of the worst-affected areas.“We were struggling for help. We made innumerable calls to the Department of Fire and Emergency Services, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, former councillor…none of them came to our rescue. Our relatives who live nearby actually swam to our house and rescued us,” she said, and added that her children were now at her mother’s house at Chikkalasandra, while she and her husband stayed back to clean their house and salvage their belongings. Residents pointed out that this comes at a time when many of them have been making do with reduced incomes owing to job loss and salary cuts on account of the pandemic. Residents have lost most of their belongings, including electrical appliances. V. Eshwar Prasad, who lives in the area, said an earthmover had been deployed by the civic body to clear the road of silt. “There is no rain as of now, but we are anxious. Three months ago, several homes here were flooded. The BBMP then had promised corrective action, but nothing has been done so far,” he said. Godown flooded Several provision shops and markets in the area have incurred huge losses. Sources said that the godown of Ramachandrapura Mutt, located behind the Dattatreya temple, where several bags of rice, oil packets, and other provisions were stored, was completely flooded. A factory that manufactured baby food, located next to the godown, was also flooded. A resident who did not want to be named said the lack of elected representatives was felt deeply. “Earlier, we could contact the local councillor. Now, with no elected body in place, in time of need, there is no one we can really depend on,” the resident said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/we-are-down-in-the-dumps-as-everything-has-been-lost/article32939491.ece
25 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Over 600 sites sold in auction, BDA mops up Rs. 610 cr. revenue||The recent auction of sites by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) saw over 600 sites sold, giving a boost to the cash-strapped agency’s coffers. BDA Commissioner H.R. Mahadev told The Hindu that e-auctioning of the sites, which were done in a phased manner since July, saw 672 sites sold of the 912 auctioned. As many as 240 sites remain to be auctioned. According to BDA data, the auction saw gradual improvement in response: in the July auction 162 of the 202 auctioned sites were sold; in August, 228 of the 308 auctioned sites were sold, and in the third phase in September, 282 of the 402 auctioned sites were sold. “We will get around Rs. 610 crore from this. Some are yet to get the sites registered. But they have 45 days after bidding,” Mr. Mahadev added. The auctioning came months after Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa announced that BDA sites would be auctioned as an additional source of revenue for the State government. e-auctions were held for sites in HSR Layout, Sir M. Visvesvaraya Layout, Banashankari, NGEF, J.P. Nagar, and Rajajinagar, among others.The cost of a site ranged from Rs. 36,000 per sq.m to Rs. 1.6 lakh per sq.m, depending on the location. The BDA had said it had fixed 1.5 times the guidance value as the price for sites located in the layouts formed before 2000, and 1.2 times the guidance value for the layouts formed after 2000. Public could participate in the e-auction to purchase sites. Geo-mapping was implemented on the BDA website for auctioned sites to enable bidders to view locations. Earlier, the BDA had tried to generate revenue by auctioning sites to fund civil infrastructure projects. More recently, its decision of selling over 1,400 civic amenity (CA) sites, currently leased to private and government bodies, in and around the city had attracted objection from citizens and activists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/over-600-sites-sold-in-auction-bda-mops-up-rs-610-cr-revenue/article32939493.ece
25 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Study in Bagalkot exposes lacunae in healthcare system||A study of the public health infrastructure in Bagalkot district has highlighted some of the perennial issues that district and taluk hospitals face — non-availability of laboratory tests and diagnostic services, besides poor maintenance of equipment and hospital premises. Major lab tests such as endoscopy, CT scan, and MRI were not even conducted in the district hospital, according to the study, conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Change (ISEC), Bengaluru. Out of the six taluk hospitals that were taken up for the study, only three had ultrasound test facility, and none of them conducted biochemistry tests. Tests such as CBC (complete blood count) and serum bilirubin were not conducted in any of the rural health facilities. The study team, led by ISEC professor C.M. Lakshmana, found that patients were compelled to approach private hospitals, at their own cost, for tests not conducted at the healthcare centres. Falling into disuse The study, sponsored by the Department of Health and Family Welfare, noted that the health staff were not trained in proper use and operation of equipment, and the machinery was not properly maintained. No health worker was assigned the responsibility of maintaining the equipment and many health centres did not even have space for it. “Over a period of time, these issues together may render the health and laboratory equipment useless,” the team’s report stated. The equipment was either partially out of order or completely unusable, Dr. Lakshmana said. The study covered 29 health institutions of Bagalkot district, including healthcare centres in six taluks, five community health centres, six primary health centres, and 11 sub-centres. The findings were based on personal visits to these institutions by a team and focus group discussions with the staff and patients. The district hospital alone provided services to over 10,000 patients a month. Some positives On a positive note, many staff members acknowledged the adequate availability of drugs and medicines. The computerised drug inventory system was working well and was said to be enhancing the efficiency of drug supply and distribution. However, interruptions in supply of power and untrained computer operators were two major impediments to drug inventory digitalisation, the report stated. As a result, patients were left to purchase such drugs from private sources. Items such as sanitary napkins were not available at many centres, and space problems when it came to storing drugs was also noticed at several facilities. Dr. Lakshmana said in the district as a whole, the team observed poor maintenance of hospital as well as residential buildings. Non-availability of water in sufficient quantity, coupled with the shortage of Group-D employees, was the reason offered by the health staff for not maintaining cleanliness. The gap between sanctioned posts and filled posts was highest in the case of medical officers at all the healthcare centres. In the district hospital, only 20 medical officers were working, as against the sanctioned number of 40. The shortage of medical staff was severe in taluk hospitals as well.  Patients are being compelled to go to private hospitals, at their own cost, for tests that are not conducted at the healthcare centres C.M.

While in the initial months, patients were being discharged only after two negative reports within 48 hours, the State changed its policy that allowed a patient’s discharge after 10 days if he/she does not have any symptoms for three consecutive days before discharge.   Meanwhile continuing the declining trend, the State on Saturday saw a further dip in cases with 4,471 new cases. It was on August 3 last when the number of new cases were 4,752. The test positivity rate (TPR) for the day reduced to 3.97%, which is a good sign. While the total number of cases touched 7,98,378, the toll rose to 10,873 with 52 new deaths. This is apart from 19 non-COVID-19 deaths. While 15 districts reported zero deaths, only two districts reported more than five deaths on Saturday. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for the day stood at 1.16%. The number of active cases too reduced in the last few days and as on Saturday, active cases came down to 86,749. Of these, 935 patients are being monitored in the ICUs. Bengaluru Urban reported 2,251 cases taking the tally to 3,23,305. With 26 of the 52 deaths from Bengaluru, the toll in this district rose to 3,714. Active cases in Bengaluru reduced to 55,983. As many as 1,12.545 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, including 90,564 rapid antigen tests. With this the total number of tests rose to 72,81,0990. Why decline? Attributing the decline in numbers to higher testing, Munish Moudgil, who heads the State COVID-19 War Room, said the State was in the third phase of linear growth since July wherein roughly a fixed number of cases add daily. “COVID-19 seems to follow three phases of growth followed by 4th phase of reduction. In the initial phase of exponential growth the cases double every fixed days. In the second phase of polynomial growth cases grow slower than exponential but more than linear. The third phase of linear growth sees roughly a fixed number of cases adding daily. For many days since July we were in the third phase,” he explained. “Now, the third phase is followed by the fourth phase of reduction provided adequate testing is done and other measures are in place. Due to diligent and ramped up testing and control on other parameters affecting COVID-19, we are seeing a reduction in cases,” he said. “The cases will reduce and stabilise at a daily lower number provided testing remains the same and citizens continue to observe SMS - sanitisation, masking and social distancing,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/recoveries-breach-7-lakh-mark/article32939150.ece
25 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Three, including wife, held for man’s murder||The police have solved the murder of a tailor from Jigani, Mahesh, 34, who was bludgeoned to death on October 17, and arrested his wife, her lover, and a friend for the crime. The accused have have been identified as Prema, 28, her lover Shivamallu, 29, and his friend Mallesh, 26, all hailing from Denkanikottai, Tamil Nadu. According to the police, Prema married Mahesh four years ago and the couple have two children. Mahesh ran a tailoring shop at Harogadde, Jigani, where the family resided. The family shifted to their native place, Denkanikottai, when the shop had to be closed for long spells during the lockdown. While they were there, Prema allegedly fell in love with Shivamallu, a neighbour, and the relationship soon developed into an extramarital affair. “They allegedly decided to kill Mahesh, as he objected to their affair,” said the police. According to the police, the affair continued even after the family returned to Harogadde. Shivamallu decided to hatch a plan to kill Mahesh and came to Bengaluru. “On October 17 evening, as Mahesh was returning home after closing the shop, Shivamallu with the help of his friend Mallesh allegedly bludgeoned him to death at a desolated spot and fled from the scene,” the Jigani police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/three-including-wife-held-for-mans-murder/article32939490.ece
25 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||CM to hit campaign trail only on last three days||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has so far been conspicuous by his absence from the BJP byelection campaign in the State. Party sources say he will join on the last three days of the campaign and hold road shows in both Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar, which are headed for polls on November 3. “He will have a limited role in the campaign,” said a close aide of his. This is in contrast to the campaign in 15 constituencies that saw bypolls in December 2019, when Mr. Yediyurappa led from the front. “The survival of the government was in question then and winning over 10 seats was critical to his continuing as Chief Minister. That is not the case here. He need not slog like he did then,” a senior party functionary said. Sources close to Mr. Yediyurappa also said he has been unhappy with party affairs and how a considerable section within the party, including senior office-bearers, have been “plotting for his removal”. “He is trying to send the message that he is unhappy,” a close associate said. Vijayendra factor However, Mr. Yediyurappa is particularly keen on a party victory in Sira. “His son B.Y. Vijayendra has been working in Sira and they want to build a narrative based on Mr. Vijayendra’s election management skills, like in K.R. Pet, especially given it is not a Lingayat-dominated seat,” a source said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-to-hit-campaign-trail-only-on-last-three-days/article32939134.ece

25 October 2020||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Two panels formed to manage Sigandur Chowdeshwari temple||Shivamogga Deputy Commissioner K.B. Shivakumar has issued an order constituting two committees to look after Chowdeshwari temple at Sigandur in Sagar taluk, which hit the headlines recently over differences between the trustees and priests of the temple. The DC, in his order issued on Friday, said the monitoring committee would include the Deputy Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner of Sagar sub-division, a retired district judge, and an auditor. The advisory committee would include the Minister in charge of the district, MLA of Sagar, Lok Sabha member of Shivamogga, the trustee of Sigandur Chowdamma Devi Trust Ramappa, and the chief priest of the temple Sheshagiri Bhat. The committees have been formed in the wake of recent controversies over the temple administration. Many organisations had appealed to the State government to bring the temple under the Muzrai Department, citing financial mismanagement in the administration. There were allegations that the trust had built many structures encroaching upon forest area. Recently, the differences between Mr. Ramappa and Mr. Bhat had attracted the attention of media. The DC had visited the temple last week. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa too had held a meeting on the issue during his recent visit to Shivamogga. The DC, in his order, said the site where Sigandur Chowdeshwari temple existed was part of Soppina Betta, within the wildlife forest area in Kargal range. Sigandur Chowdeshwari Trust had built a temple, lodge, dining hall, toilets, marriage hall, hotel, parking yard and commercial complexes by encroaching upon 20 acres of government land. The tahsildar of Sagar had ordered for the demolition of illegal structures on October 30, 2015, itself. The DC also noted irregularities in maintaining the records of valuables offered by the devotees. Citing these issues, the DC said he had submitted a report to the State government. Referring to a high court order concerning a temple in Chikkamagaluru district, the DC has favoured Muzrai Department taking over the temple. He constituted the committee to look after the temple management until the government takes a further decision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-panels-formed-to-manage-sigandur-chowdeshwari-temple/article32939141.ece

25 October 2020||Hubballi,KARNATAKA||Council elections: Why did JD(S) withdraw candidate?||Contradictory statements from the party president, local leaders and the candidate himself regarding the Janata Dal (S) decision to withdraw from the contest in the Legislative Council election to Karnataka West Graduates constituency and support an Independent candidate has given room for speculation on what transpired behind the scenes. The sudden announcement, days before the polling on October 28, about the party supporting Independent candidate Basavaraj Gurikar and the different versions of the events from leaders have led to confusion and discontent among party loyalists. In its official statement, the JD(S) on Wednesday said it was extending support to Mr. Gurikar as their official candidate Shivashankar Kallur had become “neutral” and had not been campaigning. But a different version emerged on Friday, when senior leader and former Minister Basavaraj Horatti told presspersons that because of family issues, the candidate had been “unable to campaign extensively” and reach out to the electorate, forcing the party to take such a decision. The party had announced Mr. Kallur as candidate a year ago, and interestingly, he had claimed that he had got several thousands of voters enrolled. Mr. Kallur, who did not speak much at the press conference, apparently broke down during a party meeting held later. “Winning or losing is a different matter. But I never thought of withdrawing. I have been working for a year. However, as the party leaders have decided to support the Independent candidate, I have decided to withdraw,” he said at the meeting, according to others who attended. Mr. Kallur is from Annigeri, part of Navalgund Assembly constituency, which was represented by JD(S) national general secretary N.H. Konaraddi in the previous Assembly. Mr. Konaraddi told The Hindu that he was not part of the decision-making process and the party high command had taken the decision after consulting leaders from the constituency. Considering the diminishing party base in the four districts, a few leaders are believed to have suggested that the JD(S) not field candidates for the Council poll. This view, however, was not considered earlier. But after checking the ground situation in the last couple of days, the leadership felt otherwise and the decision was taken to avoid “possible embarrassment” in case the candidate failed to garner a respectable number of votes, sources said. Following the decision, several JD(S) workers were found campaigning for Mr. Gurikar on Saturday, but those disappointed stayed away. While political observers said such a decision from the JD(S) was not a new phenomenon and there are various precedents, it seems to have dented the party’s image in the region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/council-elections-why-did-jds-withdraw-candidate/article32939135.ece
25 October 2020||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||New RCU campus to come up at Hire Bagewadi: Dy. CM||Deputy Chief Minister and Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan has said that the State government had decided to set up the new campus of Rani Channamma University (RCU) at Hire Bagewadi in Belagavi district and in the first phase a grant of Rs. 100 crore would be provided. Speaking to presspersons after inspecting land sanctioned at Hire Bagewadi on Saturday, he said that already 127 acres of land had been allotted. “Both academic and administrative wings will start functioning from the campus. If farmers come forward voluntarily to give their land only then will the government purchase it. Nobody will be forced,” he said. The DCM said that the demand for a spacious campus to facilitate the development of the university was a long-pending one. “It is difficult to find land close to the city. The finalisation of land for the new campus should not be made a prestige issue,” he said. Dr. Narayan clarified that there was a provision for shifting the multi-village drinking water project to an alternate site and the project would not be cancelled. The land identified for the new campus was earlier chosen for the drinking water project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/new-rcu-campus-to-come-up-at-hire-bagewadi-dy-cm/article32939125.ece

CM||The COVID-19 vaccine will be administered for free to people of the State, said Deputy Chief Minister and Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan. Speaking to presspersons at Sambra Airport in Belagavi on Saturday, he said vaccine trials were under way and when it is ready, it would be administered for free for all. In T.N., M.P. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K. Palaniswami and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan too had assured free immunisation against COVID-19 for all sections in their States soon after the vaccine is made available. The Bharatiya Janata Party in its manifesto for the Bihar Assembly elections promised free vaccination, leading to a debate on “politicisation” of the issue. Responding to a statement by the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah on the issue, Mr. Ashwath Narayan said the mention of free vaccination of COVID-19 vaccine in the party’s election manifesto in Bihar was aimed at boosting the morale of the people. However it was being “used to criticise the BJP”, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/free-vaccination-for-all-in-state-too-dy-cm/article32939139.ece

25 October 2020||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||‘Inexplicable delay in marking inter-State boundaries’||A mine owner and activist Tapal Ganesh had asked officials of Revenue Departments of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh to end inordinate and inexplicable delays in the survey to mark the inter-State border between Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in the Ballari reserve forest area, and to complete the survey at earliest. Mr. Ganesh displaying the inter-State border map at a press conference here recently said the officials had committed themselves to completing the exercise within 15 days, but even after a week could not make any headway. Accusing former Minister and mining baron Gali Janardhan Reddy of ‘stonewalling’ the survey and misleading officials, Mr. Ganesh alleged that his [Reddy’s] intention was to delay the process. He said the boundary marking should be done as per the Supreme Court order. In 2006, a mining company encroached upon some areas on the Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh side, following which several activists had approached the SC seeking investigation of the destruction of the boundary markers along the 15-km boundary between two States. Recently the Survey General of India (SGI) had conducted a survey and the demarcation was drawn by the SC and was agreed upon by both States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/inexplicable-delay-in-marking-inter-state-boundaries/article32939124.ece

In a media note released on Saturday, Suresh G. and Ravikiran J.P., district president and secretary respectively, demanded that the government safeguard the interests of students and teachers instead of working at the behest of private institutions. “The government closed the Vidyagama, an initiative to offer education to children at their localities to minimise the spread of COVID-19, after some cases were reported from those who participated in the programme. Now, the same government has decided to reopen institutions when the COVID-19 is still dangerously spreading. If more positive cases of COVID-19 are reported from the educational institutions after they start functioning, will the government take responsibility,” they sought to know.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/reopening-of-colleges-opposed/article32939126.ece

Dry and wet waste is being collected daily from its 27 wards, he said. The civic body had entered into an agreement with a Bengaluru-based NGO to process the dry waste collected daily from the houses. Other waste material collectors have also been told to hand over dry waste to the NGO, he said. Dry waste collected in the jurisdiction of the municipality was between 2 and 2.5 tonnes daily. The civic body collected about five tonnes of wet waste daily, which is being transported to Mangaluru City Corporation’s compost plant at Pachchanady. A private chicken waste processing unit at Baikampady collected about three tonnes of chicken waste daily from the municipality area. It made animal feed and oil used in soap manufacturing industry from it, the commissioner said. Mr. Rayappa said the municipality will set up a dry waste collection centre that is expected to be operational after a month. Four dry waste centres Meanwhile, the Mangaluru City Corporation has proposed setting up four dry waste collection centres under Swachh Bharat Mission in the city. Of them two are being constructed at Kavoor and Madhavanagar in Surathkal. Their structures are being built on the premises of sewage treatment plants, said Madhu S. Manohar, environment engineer at the corporation. The land for two more centres is yet to be finalised. Tentatively, land had been identified at Jeppinamogaru and Mannagudda. Those centres will be managed by NGOs. It has been planned to divert the dry waste collected by the contractor of the corporation every Friday to those centres for further segregation and to send material to recyclers. Though 56 specific categories of waste have been identified, broadly they can be classified into 23 categories, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ullal-cmc-stops-collecting-non-segregated-waste/article32939602.ece

The hospital will offer health services shortly, Pattadhikari of Dharmasthala D. Veerendra Heggade said on Saturday. Speaking at a function organised in Dharmasthala to celebrate the 53rd anniversary of his ‘pattabhisheka’, Mr. Heggade said Shree Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project (SKDRDP), the non-government organisation headed by him, will rejuvenate agriculture operations in 8,000 acres in the State in the coming years. It will purchase farm machinery worth Rs. 15 crore under its “Yantra Shree” scheme and make them available to farmers. It has identified 10,400 families who require housing and other basic facilities. They will be helped under ‘vatsalya’ scheme. He said that the Yakshagana ‘mela’ of Dharmasthala will stage short-duration shows in the temple town for a month after Deepavali. It is to enable devotees who host “harake bayalats” to fulfil their vows. About 30 artists of the ‘mela’ present the shows.

25 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Dasara: Virtual tours gain traction||When singer Rajesh Krishnan and his team took to the stage in front of the illuminated Mysuru palace as part of Dasara cultural programmes early this week, there were hardly about 250 people in the audience. But there were nearly 1.93 lakh people watching the programme aired on different channels and being live-streamed on social media in what was a tribute to legendary singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam who passed away recently. “This is one of the highest viewerships for Mysuru Dasara. Though people were physically not present, they were still a part of the programmes and savoured them every bit,” said Raju, Assistant Director, Department of Information and Publicity, and the nodal officer for virtual broadcast of Dasara programmes. There were also viewers from across the globe, he added. But virtual viewership is not restricted to Dasara cultural programmes alone. Turning the present crisis plaguing the tourism sector because of the pandemic into an opportunity, a group of entrepreneurs are presenting a virtual tour showcasing Mysuru to the rest of the world. Initiative It is an initiative of Gully Tours – earlier known as Royal Mysore Walks – presenting Old Mysuru with its heritage and culture to the discerning tourists. Vinay Parameswarappa, founder and CEO, Gully Tours, said it is a unique way of experiencing Dasara and it will be hosted on Zoom where a city expert would take the participants on a fun and interactive journey with live narration with the help of archival photographs, videos and maps. “The Mysuru Dasara Virtual Tour is part of a series by Gully Tours. The first was a virtual tour of Mysuru palace which was well received and had participants from India, U.S., U.K. and Australia,” he said. Participants get to explore the origin, symbolism and significance of the city’s grand festival from the comfort of their home. COVID-19 hit the tourism sector hard and Gully Tours was no exception. But it harnessed technology to take advantage of the growing trend of online working, webinars, etc. and decided to offer virtual tours that have already caught on in other parts of the world. More in the offing This experiment will not end with Dasara as Gully Tours has planned a series of simulated trips over the next few weeks including a tour that explores the story of Tipu, Srirangapatna and its global connections; one of Kochi, its spice trade history and the Jewish community; and one of the IT industry in Bengaluru. A portion of the proceeds will go to tourist guides who are without income since the lockdown began.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dasara-virtual-tours-gain-traction/article32939156.ece

25 October 2020||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Ongole soaks in festive spirit during Dasara||Dasara is the first festival to be celebrated in a befitting manner this year after the outbreak of COVID-19. Setting aside fears of the pandemic, revellers came out of their homes in large numbers to witness the grand ‘Kalaram’ processions from temples dedicated to Goddess Durga in Ongole. For the first time after the outbreak of the pandemic, large crowds were seen at places of worship as well as busy market centres in Ongole and other places in Prakasam district. Devotees enjoyed Pravarchanam, music and dance programmes on the occasion. “We are back in demand at temples organising cultural programmes,” said an orator Ponnuri Venkata Srinivasulu after naratting a religious discourse at the historic Chennakesava temple here. Following the cultural tradition in vogue, devotees oganised the ‘Kalaram’ procession, first from the Ankathammathalli temple near the Yenuga Chettu (a tree resembling an elephant’s leg) to appease ‘Ammavaru’, who according to legend had decimated the buffalo-headed demon Mahishasura. The second procession was taken out from the Narasimha Swamy temple to propitiate the goddess of wealth. Wearing masks, devotees competed with each other to offer prayers to the Mother Goddess in the flower-decked vehicle. All Durga temples in the city, including the Rajarajeswari shrine at Lawyerpet, Saibaba temple, Durgadevi temple in Balajiraopeta, Mahishasuramardhini temple in Chennakesavapeta, Mahalakshmi temple near Kothapatnam bus stand and Rajarajeswari temple in Seetaramapuram, witnessed a flurry of religious activity. The Goddess was decorated as Durgadevi on the reverred Ashtami tithi on Saturday. The city buzzed with activity as people in large numbers thronged markets for their festive shopping. Many shops and malls offered attractive discounts to woo buyers.

This year, however, sales took a hit of up to 70%due to COVID-19. “There is a pent-up demand for FMCG items, and customers are slowly trickling in. Sales are not as good as last year but we are hoping to break even,” said a shopkeeper on the busy Kurnool Road who sells televisions, washing machines and microwave ovens.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ongole-soaks-in-festive-spirit-during-dasara/article32939215.ece

25 October 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Teppotsavam: no ‘nadi viharam’ due to floods in river Krishna||In view of the flood situation at Prakasam Barrage, it has been decided to do away with the traditional ritual of taking the utsav vigrahams (processional deities) of goddess Durga and Lord Mallikarjuna Swamy for “nadi viharam”’ (celestial boat ride) on river Krishna as part of Teppotsavam that marks the conclusion of the Dasara festivities at Kanaka Durga temple atop Indrakeeladri hill. The Teppotsavam is scheduled on Sunday. A meeting of the festival coordination committee, attended by Collector A. Md. Imtiaz, City Police Commissioner B. Venkateswarlu, temple Executive Officer Suresh Babu and others, held on Saturday took a decision to this effect. Speaking to the media later, the Collector said that this year the Teppotsavam would be confined to offering pujas to the utsav idols of the deities placed on a Hamsa vahanam (a special boat built in the shape of a mythical Hamsa) but there would be no “nadi viharam” in view of floods in Krishna. Only 21 persons, including eight pandits, two priests, a sub-inspector of police and others, will be allowed to participate in the puja and the punt used for Teppotsavam would be allowed only after assessing its capacity and verifying its fitness certificate. Crowding of people on the Prakasam Barrage would not be allowed and as a precautionary measures, vehicular movement would be stopped on the newly-constructed Kanaka Durga flyover till the ritual was completed, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/teppotsavam-no-nadi-viharam-due-to-floods-in-river-krishna/article32939647.ece

Proposals to that effect were sent to the KRMB on Friday, nearly three weeks after the apex council meeting was held in New Delhi, where the Board's jurisdiction and working manuals were high on the agenda. The Andhra Pradesh government also requested the KRMB to hold its meeting once in six months to do proper monitoring of utilisation of the river waters and to make the three-member committee to take stock of the water requirement of the two States, allocations and compliance thereof in the interim period right from the beginning of the water year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-for-projects-in-lower-krishna-basin-to-be-under-krmb-purview/article32939235.ece

Small traders, who had incurred losses due to the lockdown and the restrictions imposed due to the pandemic, are hoping for a revival this Dasara and Deepavali seasons. Though online shopping sites started festive offers, a good amount of shoppers made beeline for garment stores. Many stores offered special discounts to their customers on saris, kids wear and other sections. Women were seen in large number purchasing saris. Offers like two saris for Rs. 1,200 attracted women at a shopping mall at Jagadamba Junction. “We could not celebrate Ganesh puja and a few other festivals since the last six-months due to COVID-19 situation. We plan to celebrate Ayudha Pooja and Bommala Koluvu during the Dasara festival,” said N Shanthi, a resident of Murali Nagar. Meanwhile, markets were seen overcrowded with people rushing to buy puja materials for the festival. The main roads and bylanes at Jagadamba Junction, Dwaraka Nagar, Gopalapatnam, Old Gajuwaka and Poorna Market were full of festival shoppers. “Buying clothes from garment stores is a different experience, which we do not get in online purchase. As good discounts are being provided, we are buying for Deepavali also,” said D. Madhav Reddy, an employee of a private company. COVID-19 safety norms were ignored at many places during shopping. A few persons alleged that many youngsters were carelessly removing their masks or wearing it on their chin, which could spread infections. A few small shops have stopped providing sanitisers to their customers before they enter the shops. Some pushcart vendors and sellers are also violating the basic norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/malls-garment-stores-see-festive-rush/article32939651.ece

The forum, consisting of an officer each from the Revenue Department, Municipal Corporation and the Police Departments, is being set up and will sit in Room No. 15, on the premises of Swarna Bharathi Indoor Stadium on all Wednesdays and Fridays, starting from coming week. Police Commissioner Manish Kumar Sinha said that many people come to the police stations with civil disputes and they are turned down, as they are civil in nature. Just to lodge a police complaint many return by adding a criminal colour to it, which is wrong. To avoid this problem, the forum has been created, he said. The officers nominated for the forum are Special Deputy Collector, Ch. Rangaiah, City planner, GVMC, Prabhakar, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Dwaraka Sub-Division, R.V.S.N. Murthy. The officials said that people, who wish to avail the services of the forum, can approach the respective police stations from October 26. “Parties to the disputes shall be summoned and counselled and the resultant compromise, if any, shall be produced before the Lok Adalat on the same day for passing a final award under Section 22 (c) of the Legal Services Authority Act 1987,” the officials added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pre-litigation-counselling-forum-to-start-working-in-city/article32939649.ece
25 October 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jagan adopting vindictive politics, says Ayyanna||Senior TDP leaders on Saturday hit back at the YSRCP government for demolishing a part of campus of GITAM deemed to be University here on the pretext that it was government land. Addressing the media at the university, former Minister Ayyanna Patrudu said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was resorting to “vindictive and revenge politics” by targeting the TDP leaders. “When Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy was the Chief Minister of the combined State, he had tried to demolish a part of the campus. After realising that it would be wrong on the part of the government to destroy an educational institution, he had revoked the order and restored the land. Mr. Jagan should take a cue from this,” he said. “TDP leader and GITAM founder M.V.V.S. Murthi had approached the Rosaiah-led Congress government in the combined State seeking regularisation of about 37 acres of government land that fell within the GITAM Medical College campus at government rate. But the government did not oblige. The institution that has nurtured lakhs of students is being punished because its present president Sribharat is the grandson of Murthi,” Mr. Patrudu alleged. “The machinery used for demolition purposes becomes active every Saturday to target the houses and institutions of the TDP leaders. Saturday is chosen as the courts do not function on that day and the aggrieved cannot approach it for a stay order,” he observed. “The CM should embark on self introspection and know about the number of criminal cases pending against him before pointing fingers at others,” said former Minister Bandaru Satyanaryana Murthy. ‘Act of revenge’ GITAM Medical College had rendered yeoman service when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak and had even served as district COVID hospital, he said, and added that “it is still serving the patients, but this was the treatment meted to the institution. MLA Pala Srinivas was present. Staff Reporter in Vijayawada writes: TDP Polit Bureau member K. Kala Venkata Rao condemned the demolition of the alleged encroachments at GITAM institution. He termed it as an “atrocious act of revenge” by the YSRCP government against an institution that had bagged many awards. “While the TDP government had bagged awards for development, the YSRCP government is excelling in destructive activities,” he observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jagan-adopting-vindictive-politics-says-ayyanna/article32939238.ece

25 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||On Dasara eve, railway station looks forlorn||The usual hustle and bustle at Secunderabad Railway Station on the eve of Dasara was sorely missing this year. Entry into the railway station was restricted to people carrying a ticket. While there was a constant flow of passengers, the premises outside the station wore a deserted look and the otherwise busy parking lot had sparse vehicles. In previous years, people in Hyderabad used to head to their native places in the run-up to Dasara, due to which all means of transport overflowed with passengers. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has completely changed all that. Since entry into the station was restricted only to passengers, family members and friends zipped away after dropping them off at the entrances. Platform tickets too were not sold. So, the option of sending off family or friends till the train departed was not available. “We opened the parking lot after over seven months. But not many people are parking their vehicles here,” said a man who issues parking tickets near the main entrance of Secunderabad Railway Station. The parking lot at the second entrance of the railway station is closed. Earlier, South Central Railway officials had said that no passenger should come to the stations without a confirmed ticket. Authorities thoroughly checked whether passengers wore masks and maintained physical distancing. Holding bags and wearing backpacks, people showed either a hard copy or digital copy of their tickets to gain entry. This, after sanitising their hands. Staff holding the sanitisers chased passengers, who were in hurry, to clean their hands.  We opened the parking lot after over seven months. But not many people are parking their vehicles here.

25 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Central team’s visit eyewash: Congress||Stressing that the Central team led by Union Home Ministry's Joint Secretary Praveen Vashista visiting the city to assess the flood damage had made a mockery of lakhs of people who suffered, the Telangana Congress wondered how could visiting officials study such large-scale loss caused by rains across the State in just two days. Addressing a press conference here former MPs Madhu Yashki Goud and Anjan Kumar Yadav, AICC national spokesperson Sravan Dasoju and Youth Congress president Anil Kumar Yadav said visit was eyewash. “How can they assess damage caused on such a large scale in just two days? And how can they arrive at the real picture, by depending on Telangana government officials, who failed to deliver their duty when rains and floods struck people?" asked Mr Dasoju Sravan. “Instead of following the itinerary planned by Telangana government officials and speaking to those whom officials had shepherded, the Central team should have made a surprise visit and interacted with general public, opposition parties, civic society groups to get a real picture,” he said. Mr. Sravan alleged that in many places officials had misled the Central team to hide their incompetence. “For instance GHMC East Zone Commissioner Upender Reddy, and South Zone Commissioner Samrat Ashok stage-managed and ensured that the Central team got positive feedback from people,” he claimed. The Congress was also angry that the Central team did not give an appointment to them and said instead team members sat in Taj Krishna Hotel and prepared reports, according to the briefing given by Telangana officials. Mr. Sravan said Mr K. Chandrasekhar Rao was probably the only Chief Minister in the entire history, who did not visit the flood-hit areas and did not bother to console those, who lost lives due to rains. The Congress leaders alleged that the TRS leaders were now trying to gain political mileage by distributing money offered by the government as compensation, as being given by them personally. “Why is the government not offering Rs 10,000 cheques,” they asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/central-teams-visit-eyewash-congress/article32939558.ece
25 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Few takers for RTC buses||Telangana State Road Transport Corporation’s bus stations and stops buzzed with activity as thousands from the city headed for their hometowns across the State ahead of Dasara. As a part of Dasara bus services, the transport juggernaut chalked up plans of deploying around 3,000 special buses to various destinations including Warangal, Adilabad, Khammam and Mahbubnagar, among several others. But, as on Saturday, less than half of those were pressed into service. “Last year, due to the strike called by trade unions, the operations were affected. The number of buses and passengers were reduced. But in 2018, the number of services as well as the occupancy was much higher. I think it is because of COVID-19 pandemic that the number of passengers this year is lower than that of 2018. Reduced spending capacity due to the pandemic could be another factor,” said a TSRTC staff member. On the one hand, it is from the Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station that buses towards destinations in erstwhile composite districts such as Mahbubnagar and Khammam move. On the other, the Jubilee Bus Station caters to passengers travelling to destinations in north Telangana such as those in Adilabad, Nizamabad, Karimnagar and Medak. The Uppal bus stop saw movement of buses towards Warangal and Thorrur. Buses beginning their journey from L.B. Nagar moved towards Nalgonda district and stopped en route. Those familiar with operations said a large number of passenger movement is seen towards north Telangana. While inter-district services in the State were operational, inter-State services between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh continued to remain suspended. Both State transport undertakings could not come to an agreement on the number of kilometres and the number of buses they should clock. The situation forced several passengers to travel by private transport and shared cabs. Several passengers appeared to ignore COVID-19 precautions such as wearing masks at the bus stations and stops, including at the one in Uppal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/few-takers-for-rtc-buses/article32939573.ece

The few exceptions were the budget retailers who offered big discounts on their stocks, apart from jewellery showrooms. At an upscale mall near Botanical Gardens, very few shoppers were seen. The only place that had some buzz was the dining area. Dasara is also the festival during which Telugu movie makers schedule their release to cash in on the holiday crowd. This year, the releases were limited to OTT platforms due to COVID-19 restrictions. Only the low-profile Colour Photo began streaming on OTT platforms. Missing was the festive buzz at vehicle showrooms which see a spike in sales during Dasara due to religious sentiments. The only whiff about the festival were the heaps of marigold flowers being sold in city corners and thoroughfares, and the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation buses bedecked with flowers and buntings to mark Ayudha Puja.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/shoppers-ignore-call-of-the-mall/article32939570.ece

25 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||OTP scheme for LPG refill from November 1||Come November 1, domestic liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) customers of public sector oil marketing companies in six smart cities of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana will need to share a one-time password (OTP) while taking delivery of the refills. Warangal and Karimnagar in Telangana and Visakhapatnam, Tirupati, Kakinada and Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh are the cities where the OTP-based delivery authentication code (DAC) to ensure the refill reaches the intended customer will be rolled out. The six cities form part of 100 smart cities across the country where the oil companies are getting ready to launch the project next month. Besides the smart cities, the project is likely to be extended to a few more cities, Hyderabad being one of them, sources in the companies said. Hyderabad is not part of the list, but the project of customer authenticating refill deliveries is already under way in the city, said R.Sravan S.Rao, Executive Director and State Head of Indian Oil Corporation for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The fundamental idea behind the OTP scheme is to reach the cylinder to the intended customer and push forward the digitisation process. The DAC scheme will replace the existing process of the delivery boy getting the customer’s signature on the receipt while delivering the refill and submitting it later at the LPG distributor office. In the new scheme, an one-time password received on the registered mobile phone has to be shared by the customers at the time of taking delivery. Sources in Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) said the emphasis of government is every LPG customer should be clearly identified. Thus, those using connection registered in someone else name will find it difficult with the new scheme. Telangana LPG Distributor’s Association General Secretary K. Jagan Mohan Reddy said an official communication was yet awaited. He said there are bound to be some teething issues, especially if the family has only one mobile phone and that is with someone who is at work elsewhere. Mr.Rao said customers will not be inconvenienced and refill delivered if there are issues such as those pertaining to mobile connectivity. In such cases, the delivery boy has to call the distributorship and ask them to exercise the override option that hitherto he did.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/otp-scheme-for-lpg-refill-from-november-1/article32939555.ece
25 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Dubbak poll forced CM’s hand: Uttam||The government’s decision to buy maize at a support price of Rs. 1,850 per quintal and releasing dearness allowance for employees is a victory of Dubbak people and without these elections no such decision would have come, said TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy. This was the power of farmers, employees and the support extended by the Congress to their just demands. But for these elections such a decision would not have come and if one by-poll can force Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to his knees imagine a victory for Congress in Dubbak can force him to fulfil all his electoral promises, Mr. Reddy argued. He said the Chief Minister who ridiculed government employees comparing them with dog’s tail for demanding PRC and DA had suddenly announced DA fearing the outcome of Dubbak by-poll. TRS should be defeated in Dubbak to keep the autocratic rule of KCR in check. Mr. Reddy said Dubbak results would bring a lot of changes in the State politics and the KCR government would be forced to fulfil several promises it made. Employees were yet to get a new PRC and two DAs, crop loan waiver remained unimplemented and farmers who lost their crops due to natural calamities did not get any compensation, he said adding that the government would be forced to procure all crops at MSP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/dubbak-poll-forced-cms-hand-uttam/article32939556.ece

25 October 2020||MALLAREDDYPET,TELANGANA||No festival mood among farmers of Sadashivpet||M. Mallanna is a tenant farmer as well as landlord in Mallareddypet village in Sadashivapet madnal. He has about 25 acres of land and leased out 35 acres more. He cultivated cotton on total 60 acres. He has already paid the lease amount of Rs. 5.25 lakh in advance as per the norms. On an average each farmer in this village has spent about Rs. 20,000 per acre which comes to about Rs. 12 lakh in the case of Mallanna. The total debt incurred by him for this season stood at Rs. 17.25 lakh. Had the cotton been harvested by the time of Dasara, as per schedule, Mallanna might have earned a few lakhs of rupees and cleared his debts. This was the case not only for Mallanna but several other farmers in the district. Patti Ramesh, Vadde Yadagiri and others of Pottipally and P Ravinder of Machireddypally are neck deep in trouble with their debts mounting. For the past three years, lack of rains worried farmers while this year it was excess rain that damaged the crops totally. At some places cotton is getting regenerated from the balls thereby damaging the crop totally. “Usually, we get eight quintals of yield for an acre of paddy and a qunital can be sold at Rs. 5,600 of minimum support price. Our crop was already damaged and discoloured. Who will buy the crop?” asked P. Ravinder of Machireddypaplly. Though Dasara is an important festival for people in Telangana, this year the mood was not there, given their debts, said T Pruthvi Raj, who is president of the Manjeera Rytu Samakhya.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-festival-mood-among-farmers-of-sadashivpet/article32939560.ece

Participating in election campaign in several villages held in Dubbak constituency on Saturday, Mr. Harish Rao said that the contest was between free power to borewells being offered by the TRS and power charges to borewells by fixing meters being proposed by the BJP. He said that during Congress regime motors had burnt due to irregular power. “We have presented the development in five years that was not made possible in six decades by both Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party. We have offered drinking water through Mission Bhagiratha and now women need not wait at street taps. Godavari water is being brought here from 300 km and lifted to a height of 500 metres. We are offering Kalyana Lakshmi for every eligible and eighteen families have benefited in your villages,” said Mr. Harish Rao while addressing a gathering at Govindapur, Madhira and Posanpally villages. Referring to pensions being extended to beedi farmers, the Minister questioned why the same was not extended in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states. He said farmers had been forced to pay Rs. 10,000 if the motor burnt and Rs. 30,000 if transformer burnt but the situation was changed after Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) came to power. Mr. Harish Rao said that BJP village committees were leaving the party and joining the TRS and five committees in Daultabad mandal had already joined the party. Lok Sabha member K. Prabhakar Reddy took part in the campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/dream-of-kaleshwaram-water-realised/article32939564.ece

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||A moving tale that’s more than skin deep||‘It’s 1999 and people still discriminate based on skin colour and caste,’ rues Jayakrishna (Suhas) in Colour Photo, now streaming on Aha. Oh well, in 2020 we still need the hashtag ‘Black Lives Matter’ and skin lightening creams continue to have many takers.  Colour Photo , with its story by Sai Rajesh and screenplay, direction by debutant Sandeep Raj is a film about a dark-skinned underdog, made by a group of underdogs who have worked their way into the Telugu film industry after winning over viewers with their short films. The leads Suhas and Chandini Chowdary, the supporting cast that includes Viva Harsha and Srividya Palaparthi, and Sandeep himself are familiar names to those who’ve been attuned to Telugu content on YouTube. Almost similar to their journey in shorts, where they began with comedies and moved to other genres, Colour Photo has its share of laughs when it takes us into Machilipatnam of the late 1990s, and then reveals its true, deeper colours. Jayakrishna is the son of a milk man, and a mechanical engineering student. He knows that education is his passport to better means of livelihood and recognition in society. He falls in love with the comparatively well off and fair-skinned Deepti (Chandini), whose cop brother Ramaraju (Sunil) is a vily moral police officer. It’s a familiar terrain, but the narrative makes all the difference. When Jayakrishna first sees Deepti, she is dressed as a goddess and rehearsing for a dance performance. His admiration for her is reverential, more than youthful attraction. She makes the first move and the romance blooms slowly; Jayakrishna stays cautious. Sandeep establishes the characters and their bonds beautifully — be it the segment in San Francisco between a couple, the happenings at a funeral soon after, or the friends in the engineering college. The writing gives enough room for the supporting characters to flourish. Divya Sripada and Viva Harsha as the friends, and Srividya as Deepti’s sister in law have definitive character arcs and come up with good performances. Apart from skin colour and class, the film talks about gender viewpoints. The casual racism that arises in the garb of humour is also addressed.  Colour Photo is hard-hitting and emotionally moving, but it could have been shorter. However, these are just niggles. Colour Photo has a lot going for it, including the reason for the title. The film requires patient viewing, given its deliberate slow pace.

25 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Others cannot usurp role of police and create a false narrative’||Delhi Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava answered a range of questions fromThe Hinduon policing in the Capital, the impact of COVID-19 on the force and its role during the February communal riots in the city. Excerpts from written responses to questions sent to Mr. Shrivastava:  How many Delhi Police personnel have been afflicted by COVID-19? What steps have been taken to help the affected families? Since the onset of COVID-19, 5,341 police personnel have been afflicted by the disease, of which 4,638 have recovered. We have unfortunately lost 22 brave men to COVID-19 in discharge of their duties. One of the hallmarks has been the manner in which the fallout of the pandemic was handled by the force. The officers and men continue to work hard, sincerely and relentlessly, in handling law and order, knowing well that it may expose them to the virus. We are encouraging them to build immunity against the novel coronavirus through Ayurvedic immunity drugs and yoga exercises. The Ministry of Ayush has provided us Ayurvedic medicines. The health status of each affected policeperson is monitored at a senior level. Protective gear, including mask, is provided to all police personnel. Financial assistance and compensation is being provided to those who laid down their lives in the line of duty. As Police Commissioner of Delhi, what are the major challenges on the law and order front during COVID-19 times? Around 3 crore people reside in Delhi, including the floating population. Once the unlocking process began in June, one of the primary functions has been to ensure observance of COVID-19 protocols — of wearing mask, maintaining social distancing and hand sanitisation — without affecting the resumption of normal life. It is being achieved through meaningful prosecution and general awareness campaigns across the city. Resumption of religious, political and social activities without adversely impacting the observance of COVID-19 norms has remained a major challenge. Crime has been successfully checked despite its tendency to grow during adverse socio-economic conditions. What are the new technologies Delhi Police has begun using to make it a modern, cutting-edge force? During the COVID-19 period, we have been working at the back end to adapt to new technologies to make the functioning easy, efficient and transparent. Among the first is the introduction of the e-Beat Book. It enables a police officer in the field to access the various databases regarding crime, criminals, fingerprints, photographs, stolen vehicles, etc. Such an access while in the field facilitates instant decision-making that helps investigation and verification exercises. It has helped in curbing crime, arresting criminals and connecting with the residents.  Women’s safety continues to be an area of major concern in the city...  Women safety continues to be one of the top priorities for Delhi Police. One cannot deny the concerns every resident of Delhi has for women’s safety. Any crime against women is a threat to the very dignity of society. In the past nine months of the current year, crime against women has come down by approximately 30% compared to the same period last year. However, that leaves no room for complacency. A series of crime prevention measures, which include increased deployment in areas frequented by women, deployment of women police personnel as beat officers and in PCR vans, introduction of a number of women safety projects/apps such as Himmat Plus, Sashakti, Shishtachar, anti-stalking helpline 1096, finalisation of cases involving crime against women in 60 days, investigation of cases by women police officers, improving lighting in dark spots, installation of CCTV cameras, etc. have helped in keeping a check on crime against women. We are committed to making Delhi safer for women. You took over as Police Commissioner in the middle of the Delhi riots, in which more than 50 people were killed. National Security Adviser Ajit Doval himself had to go to north-east Delhi as a confidence-building measure. The rioting continued in Delhi for four days. Did Delhi Police fail in performing its duties?  Delhi Police has a very good record in handling law and order, crime prevention and other areas requiring police attention. I am sure all possible measures were taken to maintain law and order in the city. It is not fair for me to comment on this issue for want of first-hand knowledge about the factors that were taken into consideration. There are several videos allegedly showing police complicity during the riots, including that of policemen beating and asking a Muslim to sing the National Anthem. The man died. It’s been over seven months, what action has been taken against the policemen involved?   An FIR has already been registered in the matter. The video shows some police personnel assaulting and coaxing a few persons later identified as Faizan and four others. From the CCTV camera installed nearby and video clippings, some headway has been made. The police personnel on duty near the location have been examined. Delhi Police will not spare anyone who exceeded his brief. The Delhi Minorities Commission in its report on the riots linked Kapil Mishra’s February 23 speech to the outbreak of violence. Why has no FIR been registered against the BJP leader for inciting violence?   I am not sure how it [the DMC] has come to this conclusion with the limited information and details it has. A chargesheet has already been filed in the court on the conspiracy leading to the communal riots. The police are mandated to investigate into the complaint recorded in the FIR and submit a final report (chargesheet) in the concerned court of law. It is in the court where every evidence produced by the police is evaluated and where it may be contested. Others cannot usurp the role of the police and create a false narrative. The court of law is the correct forum for this purpose. Investigation is judged on the basis of evidence and not perception. However, it has already been clarified that the investigation has concluded that riots and stone throwing took place at Chand Bagh on February 23 at 11 a.m. and the first injured reached the hospital at 12.15 p.m. as a medico-legal case. The video that shows Kapil Mishra talking to the media was taken around 3.30 p.m. on February 23. Therefore, on this count itself it is very clear that the riots had started much before Kapil Mishra was videographed making the statement. Has any explanation been sought from DCP (North East) Ved Prakash Surya as to why he was seen in the frame when Mr. Mishra spoke of removing protesters from the Jafrabad area?   DCP (North East) Ved Prakash Surya was handling the law and order situation arising from the communal riots that took place on February 23 around 11 a.m. It is for this reason that he had already put on anti-riot gear and was in the affected area when Kapil Mishra arrived at Maujpur. Since stone throwing had taken place before the video was shot, they [stones] can be seen lying on the road in the videos.  Civil society groups, many retired police officers and intellectuals have condemned what they describe as a crackdown against young activists who came to the fore in the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens...   I have already replied once before on this issue. Like in all cases we commenced the investigation with an open mind and relied heavily on scientific evidence, such as CCTV footage, WhatsApp chats, cellular connectivity, recovered deleted mobile phone data, geo-location, DNA analysis, Vahan database, facial reconstruction, fund flow analysis, etc. If the investigation based on scientific evidence points at a set of accused persons, the police will do their job. Besides scientific evidence, Delhi Police has examined a large majority of persons who either have a role in the north-east Delhi riots or have information that helped to arrive at the truth. It has questioned persons without regard to their religion and party affiliation. It has arrested 1,616 persons irrespective of their caste, religion, occupation or affiliation. Those arrested are almost equally distributed among both communities. I am sure the other community/group does not fit into the category of “young activists”. You should be equally concerned about them as well. On January 5, masked persons carrying rods and sticks entered Jawaharlal Nehru University campus and thrashed students and teachers. There has been no arrest in the case so far...   Delhi Police is investigating three cases related to the JNU incidents that occurred in January. The FIRs disclose names of students belonging to both [contending] factions in JNU. They have been examined in the cases. The case will be finalised soon. However, no person has been arrested in the cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/others-cannot-usurp-role-of-police-and-create-a-false-narrative/article32939184.ece
25 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||DU’s third cut-off list offers little hope to students||Delhi University on Saturday released its third cut-off list for its various merit-based undergraduate programmes and asked the eligible candidates to complete admission formalities via online mode. For students pegging their hopes on a drastic decrease in the cut-off required, the list offered little hope with most colleges closing admission to their more popular courses. Minimal dip Those colleges that still had general category seats to offer, reduced their required marks mostly by a few decimal points. At Lady Shri Ram College for Women, applications were closed for BA (Hons) in Sanskrit and Hindi. However, for BA (Hons) in journalism, political science, psychology, students needed 99%, 99.25% and 99.50% respectively. LSR, in the first list, had set the tone for the admission season this year by asking for a perfect score for admission into three courses. At Miranda House College, courses like BA (Hons), political science, sociology, philosophy, geography and Sanskrit were closed leaving students with an opportunity to seek admission in courses like English, history among others. At Shri Ram College for Commerce, students needed 98.75% for BA (Hons) economics and 98.12% for BCom (Hons). At Kamala Nehru College, most of the seats had been taken with only seats for BA (Hons) Hindi, Sanskrit among those open. At Hindu College, majority of the courses were closed for admission with courses in sociology, BCom (Hons) and economics, requiring a cut off of 98%. Admission under the third cut-off list will take place between October 26 and October 28. The last date for payment of fee under the list is October 30. More lists The university had earlier announced that it would be releasing five cut-off lists before the new session commences on November 18. After that, it would release special cut-off lists according to the seats left vacant. The admission under the fourth and fifth cut-off lists are scheduled to commence on November 2 and November 9, respectively. Under the second cut-off list, DU officials said that 22,147 applicants had paid the fees and completed the process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/dus-third-cut-off-list-offers-little-hope-to-students/article32939533.ece
25 October 2020||New Delhi,||‘Air pollution dampening joy of festive season, CM must act’||Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, on Saturday expressed concern over increasing air pollution in the Capital and said that it was dampening the enthusiasm of the people during the festive season. He demanded Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal immediately meet his promises made earlier to control pollution in the city and that allegations and counter-allegations will not solve the problem. The Badarpur MLA said he had, in a letter, sought to remind Mr. Kejriwal that he had promised cleaning of roads with road-sweeper machines, installing smog towers and air purifiers in Delhi, and spraying water with helicopters, etc. to curb pollution. “The time has come when the Delhi government should implement all these measures immediately,” he said, adding: “The Delhi government should ensure that roads are repaired, public transport system is strengthened, the fourth phase of the metro is quickly completed and flyovers are built to rid the city of traffic jams.” Delhi’s AQI The air quality of Delhi, Gurugram, and Noida continued to be in the “very poor” category on Saturday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. Delhi’s air quality is expected to remain in the same category on Sunday, as per government-run monitoring agency SAFAR. The Air Quality Index of Delhi on Saturday was 345, and the values for Gurugram and Noida were 325 and 347, respectively, as per CPCB’s 4 p.m. bulletin, which is an average of the past 24 hours. All three values are in the “red” category, and this level of pollution can cause “respiratory illness on prolonged exposure”. Stubble burning fire counts in Haryana, Punjab and border regions of Delhi increased from 1,213 on Thursday to 1,292 on Friday, as per SAFAR. The contribution of stubble burning to PM2.5 levels in Delhi was estimated to be around 9% on Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/air-pollution-dampening-joy-of-festive-season-cm-must-act/article32939180.ece
25 October 2020||New Delhi/Gurugram,||NCR’s annual battle for clear skies begins||Winter is almost here and the perennial battle of the National Capital Region (NCR) against air pollution, arising out of both local factors and the burning of agricultural stubble, has begun once again. Air pollution control measures under the “very poor” and “severe” categories of air quality of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) have been enforced in the NCR cities from October 15, and enforcement of anti-pollution norms by various agencies is currently under way. Whether these are able to rein in air pollution, especially with the added risk presented by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic this year, however, remains to be seen. The GRAP is a set of emergency measures to be taken to reduce air pollution, including odd-even vehicle rationing policy, depending on the level of pollution. Currently, a ban is in place on the use of diesel generators in NCR cities, except for emergency purposes. GRAP measures The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA) had written to States earlier this month to implement the GRAP measures. If the pollution of Delhi further increases, then GRAP measures under “severe+ or emergency” category will kick in. These measures, include stopping entry of truck traffic into Delhi, stopping construction activities and implementing odd-even scheme. The severe+ measures are implemented when the PM2.5 levels cross 300 microgram/cubic metre or PM10 levels cross 500 microgram/cubic metre and persist for 48 hours or more. The Delhi government has been carrying out an anti-dust campaign and has imposed fines as high as Rs. 50 lakh on a single violator. The New Delhi Municipal Corporation was fined Rs. 1 crore for inaction against open garbage burning in its limits. According to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi government has also delineated 13 pollution hotspots across the Capital for which specific plans are being created for implementation of anti-pollution action. The government has also created a dedicated war room to monitor air pollution levels. Irrespective of the GRAP measures and conditions, the Delhi government had imposed the odd-even scheme last year from November 4-15. This was announced by the government last year in mid-September, even before the pollution touched “severe+” levels as a pre-emptive action. However, this year, Environment Minister Gopal Rai said that the scheme will be the “last weapon”, only if everything else fails. Meanwhile, both the Delhi Traffic Police and the enforcement wing of the Transport Department have begun action against vehicular pollution. Delhi Joint CP (Traffic) Meenu Chaudhary said that to curb pollution levels the traffic police is working on three measures. “First, prosecution is being carried out at the hotspots and all over Delhi. The Delhi pollution control committee has identified 13 pollution hotspots in the city. We have deployed extra officers at these hotspots to ensure dedicated prosecution of vehicle flouting pollution control norms,” said Ms. Chaudhary. Imposing fines The officer added that beside strict regulations at pollution hotspots, they have intensified prosecution at other congested corridors. “We have fining vehicles for improper parking, transportation of buildings material or garage uncovered, PUC certificate and old vehicles under the category of 10 and 15 years, across the city,” she said. The second step is extra deployment at hotspots and congested corridor for better prosecution. They keep conducting encroachment removal drive at these locations to ensure smooth traffic flow. “The third measure involves the officers to formulate a pollution action plan in coordination with civic agencies to minimise pollution at hotspots and busy corridors,” Ms. Chaudhary said. Traffic policemen have been instructed to follow social distancing guidelines during prosecution. EV policy Among the highlights of the Delhi government’s battle against air pollution this year, is the recently announced Electric Vehicle policy under which incentives and benefits are extended to those buying electric vehicles, said Transport Secretary-cum-Commissioner Manisha Saxena Additions to the city’s public bus fleet, Ms. Saxena also said, were expected over the coming months with both e-buses as well as low-floor vehicles to be added to Delhi’s State-run transportation infrastructure by the first quarter of 2021 which would yield long-term results towards the objective of mitigating air pollution. “As far as enforcement is concerned, we have been taking action against vehicles, both private and commercial, for being visibly polluting, not having PUC certificates and overloading. A dedicated prosecution drive against such vehicles has been on since September and being carried out strictly,” Ms. Saxena said. According to Transport Department records, as many as 3,72,409 vehicles were checked between January and October 22 this year. Of these, 10,733 were issued challans for not having valid PUCs while 480 were issued fines for causing visible pollution. In fact, according to prosecution figures, as many as 1,397 vehicles were fined for pollution-related offences since the beginning of October. Anti-smog guns In neighbouring Gurugram, anti-smog guns at construction sites, a dedicated air monitoring cell, and night patrolling are some of the new initiatives taken by the Gurugram pollution control board to tackle the rising levels of pollution. Speaking to The Hindu , Regional Officer, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, Gurugram (South), Shakti Singh claimed that 43 anti-smog guns were installed at several construction sites within his jurisdiction to control dust. These machines, said Mr. Singh, could sprinkle water within a distance of 30 metre and help bring down the PM2.5 levels. Similarly, 22 similar guns were now positioned in Gurugram (North). Mr. Singh said there were 136 construction sites in Gurugram. With the pollution levels fluctuating, the district administration has put into place the measures to deal with the severe category of pollution that includes ban on diesel generator sets, monitoring of open burning of the waste and mechanised sweeping of the roads. Unlike previous years, an air monitoring cell has been set up at HSIIDC Office Complex in Manesar to redress any complaint related to GRAP violation with a toll free no. 18001801817. The team at the cell also responds to complaints received on social media accounts of the department. Besides, 45 devices are installed for monitoring of air emission in ‘red category’ industrial units and the real time data provided on the HSPCB and Central Pollution Control Board server for monitoring. Mr. Singh claimed that around 80% industrialists and builders had given undertakings to adhere to the GRAP. Also, notice has been served to Farrukhnagar municipal corporation to ensure door-to-door collection of the solid municipal waste and curtail open burning of waste. However, as many as 22 residential societies, including two in the DLF area, depend, partially or wholly, on the diesel generator sets for electricity supply. Besides, 40 commercial buildings also don’t have regular power connections from the grid. Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam, Chief Engineer, Vineeta Singh, said that though the power department was prepared to impart regular electricity connections to these areas, the deficiency in terms of infrastructure and incomplete formalities was on the part of the developers.

25 October 2020||Aurangabad,||BJP’s free vaccine Bihar sop injustice to others: minister||Maharashtra minister and senior NCP leader Nawab Malik on Saturday hit out at the BJP for promising free COVID-19 vaccine to the people of poll-bound Bihar, adding that such an announcement during a nationwide outbreak was injustice to other citizens. The State Minority Development Minister, speaking at a press conference in Aurangabad, said that “in Maharashtra, our government will provide the vaccine for free”. Mr. Malik said the coronavirus-induced lockdown which led to loss of lives and jobs could have been avoided if the Centre had immediately “sealed borders after the WHO alerted about the virus on December 31 (2019)”. He said the working of the Waqf Board would be made online and a tendering process for this would be completed in the next six months. He also said the head office of the Maharashtra Waqf Board would be shifted to Mumbai from Aurangabad and a regional office would function here with jurisdiction over eight nearby districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjps-free-vaccine-bihar-sop-injustice-to-others-minister/article32939025.ece
25 October 2020||GURUGRAM,||Gurugram Police chief pulled up by court||A court here has made strong observations against the Gurugram Police Commissioner in a civil suit pertaining to denial of promotion to a woman officer, saying that the Commissioner had made an “unholy attempt” to defeat the rights of the plaintiff and “browbeat” her, adding that the court was not expected to be a “mute spectator” at this juncture. The matter pertains to Raj Bala, a woman police officer, who was denied promotion on account of a warning as part of disciplinary action against her last year. After she moved the court seeking redress this year, Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division) Anil Kaushik on September 7 directed the competent authority to consider her plaint as representation and pass speaking orders. Show-cause notice However, the plaintiff’s counsel, Mayank Raghava, informed the court this month that her representation was declined and she was, instead, served a show-cause notice for stoppage of four annual increments. The then Deputy Commissioner of Police, Headquarters, Shashank Kumar Sawan, the Disciplinary Authority, had asked her “to be careful in the future”, on October 25, 2019, and she was later denied promotion. Mr. Raghava, in his plea, said the ego of senior police officers was apparently hurt since she had moved the court seeking redress. Taking strong exception to the serving of the notice, the judge observed that the “bias against the plaintiff for her approaching the court was writ large as has been revealed from the sequence of events unfolded in the case”. Taking into account the fact that the Police Commissioner had issued the show-cause notice almost a year after the order was passed by the Disciplinary Authority and in the wake of the plaintiff moving the court, Mr. Kaushik observed that the “timing indicates naked bias against the plaintiff for her approaching this court”. Hardeep Hooda, government pleader for the defendants, argued that the Police Commissioner was within his powers under the Punjab Police Rules, 1934, to review the order of the Disciplinary Authority and it was in “course of law”.  Court questions timing Mr. Kaushik, however, observed that the court could not lose sight of the timing of the show-cause notice and remarked that “it is shocking that this is going on under the very nose of this court”. Fixing the matter for hearing on October 27, Mr. Kaushik directed the Police Commissioner to file an affidavit on the next date of hearing, deposing in how many cases he has “suo motu reviewed the decisions of the disciplinary authorities subordinate to him” and in how many cases was this done when the matter was pending before the court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/gurugram-police-chief-pulled-up-by-court/article32939534.ece
25 October 2020||JAIPUR,||Drive to check purity of food material||A core group has been appointed in Rajasthan for an effective monitoring of the ‘ Shuddh Ke Liye Yuddh ’ (War for the Pure) campaign, which will start from October 26. Special teams will inspect the quality of food material, spices, flour, edible oils and milk and dairy products and collect samples for testing during the drive. Private institutions engaged in the retail sales of grocery and essential items will also join the campaign, which will continue till November 14. Chief Secretary Rajeeva Swarup said on Saturday that the drive would cover the festive season, when the demand for food products would increase and strict action would be required to check adulteration. The COVID-19 pandemic has added to the caution among the customers to buy products free of adulteration. Kirana King Retail Network CEO Anup Kumar said a circular would be issued to all the grocery outlets for taking precautions and supporting the campaign. Mr. Kumar said over 200 retail grocery stores in the State Capital would join the drive by offering the products of high quality. The core group, which will coordinate with the district-level management committees and local inspection teams, comprises senior officers of the Home, Medical & Health, Food & Civil Supplies and Animal Husbandry & Dairy Departments. Mr. Swarup, who interacted with the District Collectors through videoconferencing, said the core group would ensure on-the-spot action against those involved in adulteration and monitor the legal process for punishment to the offenders. Mr. Swarup said the provisions of The Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, would be strictly implemented during the drive. The samples will be sent to the nearest laboratories and the reports sent regularly to the State Control Room. The Chief Secretary said the persons giving information about food adulteration would get a cash reward of Rs. 51,000 each.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/drive-to-check-purity-of-food-material/article32939535.ece

25 October 2020||Mumbai,||BJP suffers another jolt as Independent MLA joins Sena||Independent MLA Geeta Jain from the Mira Road-Bhayander constituency on Saturday joined the Shiv Sena in the presence of Chief Minister and party chief Uddhav Thackeray. The joining comes a day after former senior leader of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Eknath Khadse joined the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), another member of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. Following her victory in the election in 2019 as an Independent MLA after defeating BJP candidate Narendra Mehta, Ms. Jain had extended support to the BJP. She was part of a team of Independent MLAs who had backed the BJP. Her entry to the Sena is seen as the second jolt to the BJP in one week. When with the BJP, Ms. Jain was the mayor of the Mira Road-Bhayander Municipal Corporation. Ms. Jain is the second Independent MLA to have joined the Sena after Water Conservation Minister Shakarrao Gadakh. Mr. Khadse, who joined the NCP on Friday, had already said that around 12-15 sitting and former BJP MLAs were ready to switch sides.

25 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Once U.S. leaves, Pakistan will gain more space in Afghanistan’||A debt he had to repay. That’s what senior Afghan leader and former Governor of Balkh province Ata Mohammad Noor says he thought when he first heard the news that terrorists had attacked the Indian Consulate in his capital of Mazar-e-Sharif in January 2016. Within minutes, the Governor had picked up his M-4 carbine (rifle) himself and rushed to the scene with his guards to defend the Indian diplomats trapped inside the Consulate from the gunmen shooting at them from a building nearby. “We never forgot what India did for us. When many other countries were supporting the terrorists and the Taliban, India supported the Northern Alliance,” he said, recounting the attack during his visit to Delhi this week. “As Governor, I might have had 10,000 soldiers, but I felt it was my personal responsibility to repay India for the hospitality we had received then,” he said, referring to how India had given Northern Alliance fighters shelter, medical aid and logistical support during the 1990s, when he fought as part of the Mujahideen alongside Northern Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Masood to overthrow the Taliban in 2001. Operations lasted for more than 24 hours, during which Mr. Noor led his forces, firing at the building that housed the three terrorists to stop them from escaping. All three terrorists, believed to to be militants from the ‘Afzal brigade’ of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), were killed. The siege that had begun at the same time as the JeM attack on the Pathankot air base in India, came just a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi travelled to Kabul and Lahore. “A dangerous and deadly group was sent by Pakistan, and we dispatched them,” Mr. Noor said in Farsi, using the word “Khatarnak” to describe the attackers. Diplomatic mission Four years later, Mr. Noor is in Delhi on a diplomatic mission: calling for India to take a keener interest in the Afghan situation, that he fears will deteriorate if U.S. forces pull out completely, as they have announced they will, and Doha talks with the Taliban fail to make headway. Mr. Noor, whose son Khalid is the youngest member of the Afghan negotiating team in talks with the Taliban, is himself not sanguine about the success of the talks. “The situation is complicated, and that is the reason I am here,” he told The Hindu in response to a question about worries that Afghanistan could return to a situation like 1996, when the Taliban took control of Kabul and allowed foreign groups like al-Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Toiba to grow. “I want to thank India for its proactive diplomacy in the past, and ask them to be more proactive. Unfortunately, as the U.S. leaves, the Taliban will be more aggressive, and Pakistan will gain more space,” he added, referring to Pakistan as the “mother of the Taliban”. When asked what he meant by “proactive diplomacy”, Mr. Noor said that during his talks in Delhi with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla, he had spoken of the need for India to remain “in the game”, to have a robust presence in building regional consensus for peace, to help facilitate Intra-Afghan talks, and to support the Afghan government. He said he had also asked India to consider talking to the Taliban directly, in an effort to “broaden India’s interests” and to “dilute the influence of others”, pointing to the fact that regional countries, including China, Iran, Pakistan and Russia, had increased their leverage in Afghanistan through engagement with the Taliban.  Non-Pushtun leaders Mr. Noor’s visit to Delhi follows invitations from the government to two other non-Pushtun Afghan leaders who were key commanders during the war against the Taliban: Rashid Dostum and the National Reconciliation Council chief Abdullah Abdullah, in a signal that India is re-engaging with players it has not been in contact with more recently, especially as each had differences with President Ashraf Ghani. While Mr. Abdullah had visited India previously as the Chief Executive of Afghanistan, ties with New Delhi were strained after he contested President Ashraf Ghani’s re-election in January this year. However, Mr. Noor said the former ‘Resistance’ leaders are now united with the Ghani government in their defence of Afghanistan. A leader of the Jamiat party, and an influential power figure in Kabul today, Mr. Noor became a fighter at 18, battling the Soviet Army, and then the Taliban. “If needed, we will all come together to fight again,” he says. “It won’t be the Northern Alliance... but the resistance will be there.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/once-us-leaves-pakistan-will-gain-more-space-in-afghanistan/article32938877.ece
25 October 2020||Paris,||Countries battle virus as WHO sees ‘exponential’ rise||Grim data highlighted the struggle for authorities around the world to bring the coronavirus pandemic under control on Saturday, as the U.S. reported 80,000 infections in a single day, France extended a curfew to two-thirds of citizens and Germany’s death toll passed 10,000. The World Health Organization had earlier warned of an “exponential” rise in infections threatening health systems’ ability to cope. Clashes over restrictions But populations weary of social isolation and economic hardship have pushed back against fresh restrictions to slow the resurgent virus’ spread, including overnight clashes in hard-hit Naples between Italian police and hundreds of protesters. Johns Hopkins University had earlier reported 79,963 new American cases in 24 hours, a new record, although the number of daily deaths has remained broadly stable since the beginning of autumn at between 700 and 800. Overall, more than 2,23,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S. France on Friday followed Spain past the milestone of one million cases, while the government extended an overnight curfew designed to slow the spread to affect some 46 million people. And after Germany recorded its 10,000th death from the novel coronavirus, Chancellor Angela Merkel told citizens that “the order of the day is to reduce contacts, to meet as few people as possible” in a weekly video podcast. In Poland, President Andrzej Duda tested positive for COVID-19. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned that “too many countries are seeing an exponential increase in COVID-19 cases and that is now leading to hospitals and intensive care units running close to or above capacity — and we’re still only in October.” Across the world, COVID-19 has claimed the lives of 1.1 million people and infected close to 42 million, with the WHO warning the northern hemisphere was at a critical juncture.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/countries-battle-virus-as-who-sees-exponential-rise/article32938873.ece
25 October 2020||Washington,||In Op-ed, Biden woos Indian Americans||With just days to go for the U.S. election, both major parties have been wooing Indian Americans, whose numbers in some battleground States have exceeded the victory margin there in 2016. Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s outreach to the community included a recent op-ed that talked about his main campaign issues — the botched pandemic response and rebuilding the economy — but also included diaspora specific messages, including his running mate Kamala Harris’s Indian origins. Diwali celebration “Four years ago in November, one of the last events I hosted at the Vice-President’s residence was a Diwali reception. Here I was, an Irish Catholic Vice-President opening my home for a holiday traditionally observed by Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Jains, and that night joined by Muslims, Christians, and Indian Americans of various backgrounds representing the diversity of the diaspora,” he wrote. On Ms. Harris, he wrote: “Kamala is smart, tested, and prepared. But another thing that makes Kamala so inspiring is her mother, Shyamala Gopalan. We feel Kamala’s pride when she talks about her. She was from Chennai...” “I know the pride you feel about her nomination because her story is your story, too. It’s an American story. And it’s why I’m asking Kamala to be what Barack Obama asked of me to be: the last person in the room and, together, to represent the belief in possibilities,” Mr. Biden said. The Kamala factor The recent Indian American Attitudes Survey found that the Ms. Harris running-mate pick had a significant turnout effect — 49% of Indian Americans surveyed said the choice of Ms. Harris made them more enthusiastic about Mr. Biden’s candidacy, while 15% said it made them less enthusiastic about him. In the op-ed, Mr. Biden talked about the Trump administration trying to have the Affordable Care Act overturned in the U.S. Supreme Court during the pandemic and connects Mr. Trump with Wall Street (a recurring theme in the Biden campaign), saying a handful of billionaires have done well in the pandemic. Mr. Biden also addressed Mr. Trump’s race-related rhetoric and recent policies tightening legal immigration (such as the temporary suspension of the H1B programme and new immigrant visas) in the op-ed. “We also believe America is a land of opportunity. But it’s likely you and your family have been caught in the middle of President Trump’s crackdown of legal immigration and pathways to permanent residency and citizenship and his decisions on the H-1B visa programme. And his dangerous rhetoric about immigrants has empowered White supremacists and even fuelled hate crimes against Indian Americans,” he said. Millions of Americans have already cast their vote early or by mail before Election Day on November 3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/in-op-ed-biden-woos-indian-americans/article32938871.ece
25 October 2020||Cairo,||U.S. allies welcome Israel-Sudan deal; Iran, Palestine cry foul||Sudan and Israel agreed on Friday to normalise relations, in a U.S.-brokered deal to end decades of hostility that was widely welcomed but stirred Palestinian anger. The announcement makes Sudan, technically at war with Israel since its 1948 foundation, the third Arab country to forge diplomatic relations with the Jewish state in the last two months. “HUGE win today for the United States and for peace in the world,” U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted.  Other U.S. allies, including Germany, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, welcomed the deal as a boost to stability in the West Asia. Meanwhile, Palestinian leaders strongly condemned the deal, echoing their rejection of Israel’s normalisation accords with the UAE and Bahrain signed in Washington last month. “The State of Palestine expressed today its condemnation and rejection of the deal to normalise ties with the Israeli occupation country which usurps Palestinian land,” president Mahmoud Abbas’s office said in a statement. Iran, which has been a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause, said Sudan had paid a “shameful” price to be removed from the “phony” blacklist. “Pay enough ransom, close your eyes on the crimes against Palestinians, then you’ll be taken off the so-called ‘terrorism’ blacklist. Obviously the list is as phony as the U.S. fight against terrorism.

25 October 2020||MUMBAI,||IL&FS debt resolution misses target||Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) Ltd. on Saturday reported a Rs. 7,300 crore shortfall in meeting the target for debt resolution by the September quarter citing COVID-19 related issues. This shortfall is being rolled over for resolution in the subsequent quarters, the company said in a statement. During the quarter, it could address group debt of only Rs. 1,460 crore. “The delay has been mainly caused on account of significant impact of COVID-19, which has added time and logistical complexities in the process of completing discussions with stakeholders and in obtaining approvals from lenders, regulators and judicial authorities,” IL&FS said in the statement. Stating that as per the update shared in July, the overall debt addressed based on cash balances stood at Rs. 17,640 crore, it added, “by September, an additional debt of Rs. 1,460 crore has been addressed by way of sale of education business, recovery from non-IL&FS group entities, increase in cash balances and debt repayment in green entities, increasing the overall debt addressed based on cash balances to Rs. 19,100 crore.” The number of entities resolved as of September 2020 stands at 173, or half the original number of 347 entities of the IL&FS Group. Target for December As per revised estimates, Rs. 13,200 crore of additional debt is projected to be addressed by December. This includes the Rs. 8,150 crore resolved through the proposed InvIT for which an ‘in-principle’ approval from SEBI had been received. Further, the time period for resolution of Rs. 4,200 crore being achieved through debt restructuring has moved from September to December, IL&FS said. Resolution of Rs. 10,000 crore, earlier communicated for achievement in Q3 FY21, is being moved, to be achieved in subsequent periods the beleaguered company said. Estimate unchanged The management and the new board of IL&FS, however, maintained the earlier estimate of addressing more than 50% of the overall debt, which exceeded Rs. 99,000 crore as of October 2018. “The aggregate value of debt being addressed is pegged at Rs. 56,300 crore — with over Rs. 50,000 crore likely to be addressed by March 2021,” it said. The new board of IL&FS has developed a ‘group resolution framework’ that received approval from the NCLAT on March 12.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/ilfs-debt-resolution-misses-target/article32938862.ece
25 October 2020||Bengaluru,||‘COVID-19 spurring digital adoption’||The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has compelled companies to embrace technologies and systems that have accelerated the pace of digital transformation worldwide, Michael Dell, chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies, said in a recent virtual address. “Ten months ago, few of us had ever heard of coronavirus. Now, just about every aspect of our lives has been upended. There is a heartbreaking story of lives lost, shuttered businesses, and rising unemployment. In that moment, the global economy has pivoted and the stories of passion and resilience have been inspiring,” said Mr. Dell, founder of the eponymous IT company. “Technology has never been more central than it is right now.” ‘In three months’ The pandemic had spurred firms to re-imagine their businesses. “For many enterprises, digital three-year plans got done in three months... The digital transformation will only accelerate from here, with the combination of massive computing power, 5G, and AI. It’s like a machine. The fuel for that is data; with everything becoming intelligent and connected, the relevance of data will explode.” Asserting that the data era had arrived, he said organisations needed to accelerate their digital transformation. “5G is the digital fabric that allows us to extend the cloud to the mobile edge,” he said. Dell was now focussed on offering its products and solutions ‘as a service’, the CEO said. “In the past year, we’ve seen very strong growth in our as-a-service offerings. Now, we will deliver all products and solutions as a service in an effort we are calling, Project Apex, so you can consume solutions anywhere you want, pay as you use, pay as you go or subscribe. We are full speed ahead at building the essential infrastructure for the data era, towards accelerating digital transformation with solutions that are automated, intelligent and integrated,” Mr. Dell added.  ‘More sustainable’ “People have asked for years, what happens if everyone works from home? Well, now we’re finding out. The more we can virtualise travel, interaction, collaboration, communication, the greener, more sustainable, and more productive we become,” Mr. Dell said. “This can also be a launchpad to address social disparities. A highly distributed workforce broadens the reach of opportunity. Advances in telemedicine and long-distance learning are breakthrough opportunities to broaden access to care and education. It’s not one size fits all. But overall, we’ve just jumped ahead to a more digital future, and we’re not going back.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/covid-19-spurring-digital-adoption/article32938857.ece

Ltd. cannot implement its decision to prematurely wind up six open-ended debt-oriented mutual fund schemes without obtaining the consent of unitholders via a simple majority. The consent is mandatory, as per 18(15)(a) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, when the majority of trustees decide to wind up or prematurely redeem units, the court said while declining to interfere with the FT Trustees’ April 20 decision to prematurely wind up the schemes. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi delivered the verdict while disposing the petitions filed by unitholders, who had challenged Franklin Templeton’s decision to close the schemes. However, the Bench stayed the operation of its verdict for six weeks to enable the trustees and the Franklin Templeton Asset Management India Pvt. Ltd. to approach the Supreme Court. It also clarified that there could not be any redemption by unitholders during this period of stay. It directed the trustees and the FT AMC not to indulge in any borrowing or claim liabilities in relation to these schemes. The petitions, filed by Amruta Garg in the Delhi High Court and 83-year-old investor Areez Phirozsha Khambatta and his wife in the High Court of Gujarat, were transferred to the High Court of Karnataka in June following a direction from the Supreme Court.  The High Court also clarified there could not be any redemption during the period of stay||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/ft-cannot-close-schemes-sans-unitholders-consent-says-hc/article32938859.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Aircraft carrier trials to begin soon’||October marks a watershed month for Cochin Shipyard Ltd. (CSL), a Mini Ratna PSU, as India’s maiden indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC-I) being built by the company is starting basin trials in preparation for the sea trials and subsequent induction into the Navy.   The shipyard has plans to augment shipbuilding and repair capabilities and to foray into emerging segments such as urban mobility, CMD  Madhu S. Nair  said in an interview. Excerpts:  What is the status on the aircraft carrier? Basin trials of the carrier [that displaces 40,000 tonnes] are set to begin this month. This is when its propellers are being turned for the first time using the vessel’s own power. In fact, along with this is the activation of a gamut of allied systems and controls. For a ship of its size and complexity, it’ll be a major milestone that also signals that the sea trials are not far away. But that depends on a number of factors including the opening up of international travel as commissioning engineers are to arrive from various overseas locations.  How has the firm fared during the pandemic? Working in two shifts since April, we have been able to return to about 75% of capacity. We have orders worth Rs. 14,000 crore. Last year, we bagged an order from the Jindal group for four mini bulk carriers and another from the Union Home Ministry for nine floating border outposts for the BSF. Then the pandemic struck, but we were able to get this order for autonomous vessels from Norway. From a value point of view, it’s just about Rs. 125 crore, but this contract, signed amidst the pandemic in July, is significant for us because of its technology and because it offers us a strong learning curve. We think there’s a market in India for boats and vessels that aren’t very large but where technology will stand out. With appropriate partnerships, we can build for the world too. This autonomous vessel, for instance, was developed by Kongsberg Maritime in Norway. It has a 1,800 KWh battery system and it is not easy to integrate and prove such systems in a marine environment. We are already building hybrid electric ferries for the Kochi Water Metro. Have your off-campus ventures begun to look up? The ship repair facility in Mumbai, in the dock leased from the port trust, had done well last year doing business worth Rs. 55 crore. We were bolstering the infrastructure when the pandemic hit the city hard, which hit our work too. It’s just a matter of time before it gets into a stable phase, though. In Kolkata, unlike Mumbai, there was no developed ship repair ecosystem. But it was better than what we expected. We are handling the fifth project there now, a dredger of the DCI. In Port Blair, there are people on ground, but the COVID-19 situation remains bad which will further delay the maiden project by a few months. These apart, we have taken over Tebma Shipyard in Karnataka and are going to build some fishing vessels there. We want to begin operations in January, 2021, and are in the process of recruiting hands. The Hooghly Cochin Shipyard in Kolkata where we intend to build inland vessels should be ready for commissioning by the end of this year or early next. What does the shipyard’s strategic plan for 2030 comprise? It’s an ongoing evolutionary vision plan called CRUISE 2030 prepared in collaboration with the Boston Consulting Group. It’s multi-pronged and is intended to strengthen our core areas of shipbuilding and repair and to venture into adjacencies and emerging spheres targeting manifold growth. Construction of smaller, hi-tech platforms to contribute to sustainable, modern urban mobility, to cite an instance. And the orders are in large numbers. Also part of the long-term strategy are systems to improve internal efficiencies, to unlock value. It’s some time since we have introduced full digital movement of files. Now we are creating a digital centre of excellence in which various things are looked at: maybe a chat bot to assist, a handheld app to guide contractors and people’s entry into the shipyard etc. Sensor-based tracking of material movement, digital access control and the like are all being looked at. The processes are being digitally realigned. Concurrently, we have just replaced a 25-year-old life cycle management platform, a benchmark then, with a new manufacturing excellence system developed by Dassault Systems, which will also interlink all processes. As part of your infrastructure expansion, there’s this large dry dock being built in Kochi and an international ship repair facility (ISRF) on land owned by the Cochin Port Trust. Are these projects on schedule? Both were moving fast. We had a predominantly migrant labour force and the pandemic slowed down the work, as social distancing protocols and the ban on working at night kicked in. But we are hopeful of completing the ISRF by the end of 2021 and the dry dock in the latter part of 2022.  The order from Norway for autonomous vessels offers us a strong learning curve||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/aircraft-carrier-trials-to-begin-soon/article32938861.ece
25 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Urban Company’s revenue may double’||Home services aggregator Urban Company, which has onboarded 6,000 service partners over the past two months, is expecting to double its revenue in the current financial year, driven by higher demand for services such as men’s grooming, home cleaning and home painting, than before the pandemic. “We’ve been fortunate and the business has come back very strongly after the lockdown,” Varun Khaitan, co-founder, Urban Company, said in an interview. “We are optimistic about the trajectory here onwards as more consumption happens. Consumers will come back to us in even larger numbers, and by the end of the financial year, we hope to be twice of what we were in March, in terms of revenue,” he added. The firm had posted a revenue of Rs. 216 crore for FY20, a growth of 103% over FY19. With the onboarding of service providers over the last two months, the total number now stands at about 30,000 in 18 cities. “This [6,000 service providers], I think, is sizeable and most of these people are those who had lost their previous jobs because their workplace had to shut down. From what we understand, 30-40% offline salons and spas have shut down and may not open,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/urban-companys-revenue-may-double/article32938855.ece

25 October 2020||Tokyo,||Tokyo opens Olympics Aquatics Centre||Tokyo opened a 15,000-seat swimming venue for the Olympic Games next year on Saturday, with a swimming star diagnosed with leukaemia last year demonstrating freestyle at the ceremony. The $542 million Aquatics Centre for swimming, diving and artistic swimming was completed in February, but its opening ceremony scheduled for March was postponed due to coronavirus.  “I hope top athletes in the world will compete at this venue... I'm already excited,” Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told newspersons. Koike said the city hoped to welcome more athletes, promising to host a “successful” Olympics through implementing anti-virus safety measures. At the ceremony, Japanese swimming star Rikako Ikee joined three other athletes in a relay. The 20-year-old had been a strong favourite for the 100m butterfly gold at the now-postponed Olympic Games before revealing she had leukaemia last year. After being discharged from hospital in December following 10 months of treatment, she resumed training in March, and competitions in August. Novel features The main pool at the Aquatics Centre features a movable wall allowing the 50-metre facility to be converted into two 25-metre pools, with the depth also adjustable. The building cost $542 million but Tokyo hopes to make the most of the facility after the 2020 Olympic Games, aiming to attract one million users a year — 850,000 through various swimming competitions and roughly 150,000 casual punters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tokyo-opens-olympics-aquatics-centre/article32939173.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||KXIP snatches win from under SRH’s nose||Chris Jordan’s three for 17 helped Kings XI Punjab defend the lowest total — 126 — this edition and edge past Sunrisers Hyderabad by 12 runs at the Dubai International Stadium on Saturday. With SRH needing 17 off the last two overs, KXIP captain K.L. Rahul took a gamble and bowled Jordan in the penultimate over. The Englishman vindicated the decision, conceding just three and picking up the wickets of Jason Holder and Rashid Khan off successive deliveries. The slide Arshdeep Singh (three for 23) then defended 14 off the final over as SRH slipped to 114 all out after being 56 for no loss at one stage. It was Arshdeep’s dismissal of Vijay Shankar in the 18th over that opened the floodgates after SRH had remained in the chase for most part. Jonny Bairstow (19, 20b, 4x4) and David Warner (35, 20b, 3x4, 2x6) infused urgency, adding 56. Warner was out caught-behind off Ravi Bishnoi (one for 13) after a referral. Bairstow and Abdul Samad fell soon after. Manish Pandey and Shankar arrested the slide with a 33-run fourth-wicket stand. But once they fell, the KXIP bowlers took over and delivered the team’s fourth consecutive victory. Slow start Earlier, Rashid (4-0-14-2) spearheaded an incisive bowling performance for SRH after it asked KXIP to bat. Rahul (27, 27b, 2x4, 1x6) and Mandeep Singh — opening the innings in the absence of Mayank Agarwal — were off to a slow start. Sandeep had Mandeep caught at deep square-leg for his 100th IPL wicket. Chris Gayle started with a couple of boundaries, but T. Natarajan (none for 23), Rashid and Holder (two for 27) kept the batsmen on a tight leash.  The pressure eventually told when Gayle and Rahul fell off successive deliveries, leaving KXIP struggling at 69 for three after 11 overs. Nicholas Pooran and Glenn Maxwell were watchful, but before the duo could shift gears, Sandeep dismissed Maxwell in the 14th over. Pooran’s rescue act When Rashid had Deepak Hooda stumped by Bairstow four balls later, KXIP was in a spot of bother. The otherwise free-stroking Pooran remained unbeaten on 32 oﬀ 28 balls (2x4), his cautious innings proving the difference in the end.   The day in numbers  Second lowest total defended by KXIP in the IPL after the 119 against MI in 2009 This is the lowest target SRH has failed to achieve in the tournament. It had faltered while chasing 137 versus MI in 2019 SRH lost its last seven wickets for just 14 runs to slump from 100/3 to 114 all out)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/disciplined-srh-stifles-kxip/article32938952.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Varun bamboozles Capitals||Varun Chakravarthy’s mystifying spin (4-0-20-5) left the Delhi Capitals befuddled as it slumped to a 59-run defeat against Kolkata Knight Riders at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Saturday. After Nitish Rana (81, 53b, 13x4, 1x6) and Sunil Narine (64, 32b, 6x4, 4x6) — back in the team after a four-game absence, during which his bowling action was cleared — forged a 115-run stand off just 56 balls to propel KKR to 194, Varun broke DC’s back during the chase. He dismissed every match-winner DC could boast of — Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant, Shimron Hetmyer, Marcus Stoinis and Axar Patel. The win helped KKR stay in the race for the playoffs. DC benched an under-performing Prithvi Shaw and paired Ajinkya Rahane with Shikhar Dhawan. But that move did not yield the desired result as Pat Cummins sent both packing early. Dream spell Shreyas (47, 38b, 5x4) and Pant (27, 33b, 2x4, 1x6) combined for 63 runs for the third wicket to leave the match interestingly poised. But Varun’s dream bowling in his first three overs (3-0-12-5) slammed the door shut. The DC batsmen struggled to pick him, and everyone except Axar fell while trying to slog. This was the 29-year-old’s maiden five-for. Earlier, after being asked to bat first, KKR rode on Rana and Narine’s efforts. Having scored just 84 in its last outing against RCB, KKR was in trouble again at 42 for three. The left-handed duo stepped in to ensure that there were no further slip-ups. Rana, who was promoted to the opener’s slot, accelerated to perfection. Narine, at the other end, complemented his partner. DC speedsters Anrich Nortje and Kagiso Rabada ran out of steam after prising out the three top-order batsmen while Ashwin was the most expensive, conceding 45 in his three overs. Still, the match hung in the balance until midway through DC’s chase before Varun made it his evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/varun-bamboozles-dc-keeps-kkr-afloat/article32938954.ece
25 October 2020||NEW YORK,||NBA eyes a December start: reports||The NBA is looking at starting a 72-game 2020-21 season in December and finishing in time for players to compete at the Tokyo Olympics according to multiple reports on Friday.  The Athletic and ESPN, citing unnamed sources, said the league told team owners in a Friday conference call about the plans, which would require approval by the players union by the end of October. After the playoffs ended on October 11 due to a COVID-19 shutdown last March and a July restart, the league would have only a 72-day break before a December 22 restart, three days before the NBA’s usual plethora of Christmas Day game offerings, The Athletic reported. The move would allow greater income and more games compared to a January restart and allow the league to crown a champion and leave a window for NBA talent to play for homelands in the Tokyo Olympics, where the US team would seek a fourth consecutive gold medal. Play-in format A play-in tournament for the final playoff spot in each conference, an idea developed due to the pandemic-hit season, would continue, according to the reports. The National Basketball Players Association must agree upon any deal regarding when to start, with ESPN reporting there had been talk about a mid-January start on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday and staging more games later when chances might be better for spectators to attend. USA Basketball has started asking about player availability for the July 23 start of the Tokyo Olympics to allow time to select players and prepare for the tournament. The NBA would prefer to play in home arenas rather than a bubble and is looking at playing a team multiple times on a trip to reduce travel. Financial parleys Talks continue between the NBA and players union over such issues as financial breakdowns and a salary cap for next season. ESPN reported October 30 would be a deadline for talks and mark eight weeks before Christmas, NBA commissioner Adam Silver having said there would be at least eight weeks between a union deal and the start of next season. The NBA has set the NBA Draft for November 18 with free agency expected to begin soon after for the 2020-21 campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nba-eyes-a-december-start-reports/article32939176.ece
25 October 2020||BARCELONA,||Real Madrid asserts itself with facile win||Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos once again proved to be the man for the big occasion as he converted a fiercely-debated penalty to help his side to a 3-1 win over rival Barcelona at an empty Camp Nou in LaLiga on Saturday. Ramos, making a record 45th appearance in the ‘Clasico’ fixture, was awarded the spot-kick following a VAR review, after falling in the area when his shirt was tugged by Barca’s Clement Lenglet as the pair contested a corner. The defender showed his customary calm to score from the spot in the 63rd minute and restore the champion’s lead, after Federico Valverde had opened the scoring in the fifth minute only for 17-year-old forward Ansu Fati to equalise less than three minutes later. Barca ran out of steam in the second half and Madrid missed two big chances to seal the points before substitute Luka Modric clinched it with a goal in added time. Back on top The victory took the champion Madrid back to the top with 13 points from six games, while Barca, which has only taken one point from its last three league outings, is down in 10th on seven points from five games. Manchester United remained winless at Old Trafford in the Premier League this season after it was held to a 0-0 draw by Chelsea. United, which had lost their opening two home games of the season, have seven points from five games and are in 15th place while Chelsea is sixth place on nine points from six games. Lewandowski ’tricks In the Bundesliga, Robert Lewandowski scored a hat-trick as Bayern thumped a hapless Eintracht Frankfurt 5-0.  The results:   LaLiga: Barcelona 1 (Fati 8) lost to Real Madrid 3 (Valverde 5, Ramos 63-pen, Modric 90).

25 October 2020||Abu Dhabi,||Royals in must-win clash against Mumbai||Skipper Rohit Sharma’s fitness would be a concern for defending champion Mumbai Indians as it looks to continue its dominant run, while a depleted Rajasthan Royals would hope to stay afloat when the two clash here on Sunday. MI roared back to form crushing Chennai Super Kings by 10 wickets on Friday after the Super Over loss to Kings XI Punjab. Royals, on the other hand, lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad by eight wickets. Questions remain on whether Rohit, who suffered a hamstring injury and missed the game against CSK, will be available on Sunday. But Ishan Kishan and Quinton de Kock ensured the team did not miss its skipper. The bowling is well served by Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah, who are lethal upfront and in the death. Royals’ biggest worry is skipper Steve Smith’s form and a misfiring top-order. Ben Strokes (110), Sanju Samson (272) and Jos Buttler (271) have flourished individually, but failed to deliver collectively. CSK in disarray Its dugout in complete disarray, CSK will look to find a semblance of respectability when it takes on RCB at Dubai on Sunday. The three-time champion has struggled in all departments of the game. RCB, on the other hand, has grown in confidence. Virat Kohli and his men will aim to grab the two points on offer, while also improving their net run-rate, which could be vital in deciding the top two teams heading into the playoffs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/royals-in-must-win-clash-against-mumbai/article32938955.ece
25 October 2020||PANAJI,||We will play exciting football and win games: Robbie Fowler||The new East Bengal head coach Robbie Fowler on Saturday said his team will play an exciting brand of football, relying on ball possession and short intricate passes, during the Indian Super League which begins on November 20. “We will play the right way. For me, the right way is playing with the ball at your feet, short sharp intricate passes, get the players moving and helping each other and not just pass it long ball for the sake of it,” Fowler said in an Instagram Live session. “We won’t be playing long balls, we want to hold on to possession. Possession on the right side of pitch, not just knocking it around in the back. We want to play in the opposite half, exciting football and win games. The best way is putting the opposition in the backfoot,” he added. The upcoming season of the ISL will take place behind closed doors in empty stadiums. “We can’t do anything but there will be time in the near future when we will be playing with lots of passionate fans. I would like nothing more than to travel to Kolkata and play with a successful team next year,” said the Liverpool legend. “That day will come but right now we need to do what we need to do. “It’s not easy but it’s something we have to adapt and accept.” With a late inclusion to ISL, East Bengal appointed the 45-year-old with less than two months left for the scheduled start of the tournament and Fowler feels the team will have to play catch up. New challenge “It’s a new challenge for us, we will go into this season and we will be competitive. What we have to keep in mind is that we have been many many weeks behind the other teams. “We were late getting together because of the new club. We will catch them up pretty soon. It might be a few weeks before you see the best East Bengal,” he added. Fowler has signed six foreign players with another addition expected soon. “The players we have brought in are exceptional. We have got plans to bring one more. It is about getting the spine of the team right.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-will-play-exciting-football-and-win-games-robbie-fowler/article32939169.ece
25 October 2020||LONDON,||Games cannot be ‘marketplace of demonstrations’: Bach||Olympic chief Thomas Bach warned against allowing the Games to “descend into a marketplace of demonstrations” on Saturday after criticism of a rule banning protests by athletes. The International Olympic Committee president has come under fire for the ruling, announced in a year which has seen widespread support by athletes for the Black Lives Matter movement. But Bach, who won a team fencing gold medal at the 1976 Olympics, said he had learned first-hand about the “political impotence of sport” when West Germany boycotted the 1980 Games over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. “The athletes personify the values of excellence, solidarity and peace. They express this inclusiveness and mutual respect also by being politically neutral on the field of play and during the ceremonies,” Bach wrote in The Guardian . Spirit of sport “At times, this focus on sport needs to be reconciled with the freedom of speech that all athletes also enjoy at the Olympic Games. This is the reason there are rules for the field of play and the ceremonies protecting this spirit of sport. “The unifying power of the Games can only unfold if everyone shows respect for and solidarity to one another. Otherwise, the Games will descend into a marketplace of demonstrations of all kinds, dividing and not uniting the world.” ‘Taking the knee’ Earlier this month, World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe backed athletes’ right to “take the knee” on the Olympic podium, as long as it was done with “complete respect” for other competitors. Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick made headlines when he began kneeling during the US national anthem in 2016 to protest police brutality against Black Americans and other minorities. He was ostracised by the league and criticised by US President Donald Trump, but in June the NFL sanctioned “peaceful protests” and world football’s governing body FIFA has urged leagues to use “common sense” when deciding whether to discipline political activism. In June, US athletes and 1968 Mexico Games icon John Carlos, famously kicked out of the event for raising his fist in a black power salute, called on the IOC to scrap the ban on protests. “Athletes will no longer be silenced,” they wrote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/games-cannot-be-marketplace-of-demonstrations-bach/article32939171.ece
25 October 2020||London,||Mikel Arteta pulls his weight behind Aubameyang||Mikel Arteta has backed Arsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to prove his recent goal drought was just a blip. Gabon star Aubameyang had gone four matches without scoring until hitting the winner in Thursday’s 2-1 Europa League victory at Rapid Vienna. Faces criticism The 31-year-old has been Arsenal’s most dangerous forward since his arrival from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018, but he was still singled out for criticism following his barren spell this term. His anonymous displays during defeats at Liverpool and Manchester City were especially frustrating for Arsenal fans. But Aubameyang has scored 19 goals in 29 appearances for Arsenal since Arteta's appointment in December and the Gunners boss has no doubts his player can cope with the great expectations. “Expectations for him are that he has to score a goal every game,” Arteta said ahead of Sunday's Premier League clash against Leicester. “So this comes with the nature of the big player that he is, what he has done in the past. People expect that from him in the future. “We are here to help him with that, and we will support him when difficult times come around him. “He needs to get in more goalscoring opportunities, he needs to get the ball more round the box, in order to do what he is able to do.” Tougher time Arteta also claimed the calibre of recent opposition inevitably led to Aubameyang having a tougher time. “If you look at our fixtures we have already played five games out of seven against top, top opposition,” he said. “It is the same for him or (Manchester City striker) Sergio Aguero, who didn't have a shot on target as well on the weekend. It is not an isolation of just our player.” Aubameyang has been largely deployed on the left flank in recent months by Arteta, a move which saw him flourish in FA Cup wins over City and Chelsea last season. Arteta did move him into a central position against Sheffield United this season and he knows there will always be questions about his use of the talisman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mikel-arteta-pulls-his-weight-behind-aubameyang/article32939167.ece
25 October 2020||MUMBAI,||Tanmay Srivastava announces retirement||Batsman Tanmay Srivastava, who was part of India’s Under-19 World Cup winning team in 2008, announced retirement from all forms of cricket on Saturday, saying he has found new dreams and bigger aspirations to work towards. The 30-year-old left-hander took to social media to make the announcement but did not specify his new plans. “It’s time to bid adieu to my cricketing playing career! I’ve built memories, made friends, achieved the best I could in these playing Junior Cricket, Ranji Trophy and most-importantly being a good performer in U-19 World Cup, 2008 and bringing the cup home with the team!!,” the Kanpur-born cricketer tweeted. Srivastava thanked his coaches, Uttar Pradesh cricket administrators, parents and wife for being a constant source of support. “I think I have made enough cricketing memories on and off the field to last me a lifetime. For all those who still feel, I should have not retired yet, well...,” he said. Srivastava played 90 First Class matches and scored 4,918 runs, with 10 centuries and 27 fifties. In the 2008 U-19 World Cup in Malaysia, he was the tournament’s leading scorer with 262 runs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tanmay-srivastava-announces-retirement/article32939179.ece

The three T20Is, which were earlier scheduled at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, will now be held at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Nov. 7, 8 and 10. “Following the sudden deterioration in air quality and now further expected air pollution in November, we have made a swift decision to move the matches scheduled in Lahore,” PCB chief executive Wasim Khan said in a statement on Friday. Poor air quality  “The early onset of hazardous pollution and subsequent poor air quality meant that the risk to keep matches in Lahore at this stage was too great.” The rescheduling also affects the remaining four Pakistan Super League matches which will now be held in Karachi. “For the sake of everyone involved and to ensure the remaining four matches of the HBL PSL and the three T20Is against Zimbabwe were completed without risk or interruption, it was important to move the matches,” Wasim said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pakistan-shifts-t20is-against-zimbabwe-to-rawalpindi/article32939177.ece

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Gazing into the future||Spool back seven months. At CEEBROS Belvedere, jugaad had broken new ground. Temporary wash basins had come up, one at the entrance, and another in the garden. Connected to Sintex dustbins, these wash basins were a home-brewed idea. Right now, another jugaad is brewing at this gated community on Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) — 28 pedal-operated sanitiser stands are being made in-house. They would soon keep the “temporary” wash basins company. Girish Narayanan, president, CEEBROS Belvedere Owners Association (CBOA) reveals, “We continue to have those wash basins at the gate and in a couple of other places. Besides, at the entrance to each block, a metal-based pedal-operated hand sanitiser stand has been parked. The next plan is to have one such stand at every floor.” Hitting jugaad street The community has seven blocks, each coming with four floors. So, providing sanitiser stands on 28 floors is the target. “The Facilities Management Team is making pedal-operated sanitiser stands themselves instead of buying them from outside. They have already made a few makeshift pedal stands by using PVC pipes,” elaborates Girish, adding that already a couple of makeshift pedal stands made with PVC pipes have been pressed into service. Girish wants to see hand-washing becoming a visible feature of community living, going well beyond the pandemic. Keeping germs of all stripes at bay, at all times, does not hurt anyone. “By keeping a sanitiser stand on each floor, it becomes a more personalised solution for residents of that floor,” says Girish, adding that the pedal-stand project has invited sponsorships. At the OSR park which comes paired with playthings, a stage and a basketball court that doubles as a badminton court, a permanent wash basin is set to be installed. Water and soap would be kept at the facility. “The idea is that anyone entering the OSR area washes their hands, and washes again before leaving,” he says. “It is mandated and will be a permanent feature.” A major reason for having a permanent sanitisation station at the OSR park is to protect children from other infections as well, he points out. “Children can carry scabies, picking it from the mud. When they come home, they may immediately take a snack, forgetting to wash their hands. If we mandate washing of hands at the park itself, we ensure that kids are going to do it.” Though Girish would like to say that the pedal-operated sanitiser stands would also be a permanent feature, he chooses to puts a guarded and realistic number to the initiative, for the time being. “For another one year, at the least.”  Gateway to safety  A rack at the entrance of gated communities is a symbol of these times. Where deliveries are concerned, a great number of communities want to keep the exercise restricted to the gate for some more time to come. Many of them have gone in for a rack to make the collection process safer and easier. “Three months ago, we kept a simple cost-effective rack at the gate, and it has changed the workflow and increased social distancing and minimised the time of contact between the community’s security staff and delivery professionals. Delivery persons straightaway keep these parcels on the racks. The security staff only have to hand it over when residents come to collect it,” says Suresh Dhayaalan, secretary, Victoria Towers Owners Welfare Association. “There is a likelihood of this prop becoming a permanent feature,” adds Suresh, whose gated community is in Kazhipattur, OMR. Even after communities feel safe about accepting deliveries on the doorsteps, will they offer the option of a safe facility at the gate where these can be deposited for collection? If they do become a permanent feature, would these collection racks get more sophisticated, even evolving into a fool-proof locker system? Or would collection facilities be integrated into the construction, and made up of brick and mortar? The pandemic has left us with more questions than answers, with many sure-footed answer stumbling along the way. One observable feature is that, at this point in time, as communities try to streamline the deliveries collection process, many of them are prepared to spare some generous real estate and metal for it. “We want to have the deliveries made at the gate for at least one more year. We have cleared a storeroom of electrical fittings — hardly ten metres from the gate — and are using it to keep the deliveries. We are going to place seven racks inside this room, one dedicated rack for each block. The delivery person would deliver the goods at the gate; collecting it, the security staff will place it in the appropriate rack, and inform the resident concerned. Residents have to collect their deliveries,” says Girish. Wheel in a feature  One adjustment often necessitates other adjustments. At Appaswamy Cityside in Kandanchavady, a trolley used by the housekeeping staff for their work has been repurposed as a vehicle to transport deliveries to residents’ doorsteps. “As the grabage collection bins come with wheels, we decided the trolley could be spared to meet a new exigency. The trolley is kept at the gate and when a heavy item or a collection of items have been delivered, and the resident concerned cannot lug it all the way back to their home, they could use the trolley,” says Rabiya Aftab, Association president at Appaswamy Cityside. “We may go in for one more trolley for this purpose. As we are just a 136-unit apartment, two trolleys would do.” Though at present, the security staff wheel in deliveries for senior citizens at the community, Rabiya thinks after the pandemic, seniors may even want to exercise this option themselves, that is if the system of delivery of goods at the gate is allowed to continue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/gazing-into-the-future/article32939303.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Have you ever considered putting your community on a ‘declutter’ diet?||Things bought on a whim and ignored after the initial enthusiasm is past. Things flaunted a gazillion times and therefore, cannot be flaunted anymore. Declutter Elcot Avenue (DEA) rockets such items back into the orbit of usefulness through a community-driven reusing exercise. An initiative at Elcot Avenue in Sholinganallur, it transfers used and unused items rendered useless in one pair of hands to another pair that values it. It is for the owner to decide whether to offer an item for free or a price. Benazir Tehrani started DEA onWhatsAppduring lockdown when she realised her universe would not shrink into insignificance if it shed some non-essentials and essentials and those things that lay in-between. High up on the list was a telescope admittedly bought in a fit of impetuousness for her daughter, and put on star-gazing duty as frequently as the exoplanet Gliese 581g is visited. In plain terms, it remained unused. With many of her neighbours in Elcot Avenue and Kumaraswamy Nagar, Sholinganallur, similarly identifying forgotten, dusty items, DEA has become a community initiative. R. Ramaswamy, president of Clasic Farms Owners and Residents Association and Secretary-cum-Treasurer of Clasic Gardens Owners Association, Kumarasamy Nagar, puts it this way: “This community which has earned accolades and awards for its zero-waste initiatives, jumped at the idea of decongesting their homes and giving away gently used items.” He adds: The families went on a “Treasure Hunt” looking for items that can be recirculated. “Nobody can promote any business in this group,” states Benazir. “It is a platform for recycling and reusing used items.” Benazir explains that at first, the initiative reached out to three NGOs by donating old clothes for them to make masks. “We were donating bags and bags of clothes. But how long can we be giving away only clothes?” says Benazir. By then, she realised it would be great idea to try to tackle a challenge people faced while relocating. These people struggled to find takers for items they wanted sold quickly for a nominal price. In the middle of Chennai’s information-technology heartland, Elcot Avenue with its mix of gated communities and independent bungalows, often has a family relocating abroad or to a different Indian metro on work. Benazir says many a time she has noticed huge mattresses in good condition being thrown by the side of garbage bins. “When I would try to find out the reason, I would invariably learn that there were no takers for these things. Sometimes, in our car park, there would be items abandoned by a family that is moving out,” says Benazir, who lives in a gated community. “By finding takers for these items within the community itself, the problem of transport is automatically addressed. It would be just a case of moving the items around the complex.” Benazir admits to being inspired by a couple of community-driven “decluttering” initiatives in Mumbai. Under the overpowering shadow of the pandemic, there is always a risk attached to people dropping in to inspect items offered for sale (or for free), how is the safety question addressed? Benazir says “everyone takes responsibility for maintaining social distancing and sanitising” and meeting all the necessary safety requirements. The group has largely restricted DEA to Elcot Avenue and surrounding areas, because, as Benazir puts it, the community here has a strong three R’s culture (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle). Strict guidelines The WhatsApp group is not operated by a laundry list of guidelines; but from what the admins say about the ones in operation, these are cut in gabbro-stone. “Anyone offering an used item and those keen on buying it can’t have a discussion over the sale in the group. They have to take the transaction to their private chat. We also don’t encourage too much talk, and so, anyone posting an item should present one or more pics (in a collage) and pair it to a short description along with a mention of the price,” elaborates Benazir. There are regular instances of an owners of an item choosing to just give it away, for free. “My daughter had a huge telescope costing Rs. 5,500, which we had bought on a whim and a fancy, and we knew she was not going to use it. I said I was not going to sell it, but give it away to a child who was really interested in astronomy. So, I asked if anyone was interested and asked them to message me. I said I would speak to the child to gauge their interest in astronomy. One child was identified, and the telescope was given free to her,” says Benazir. She notes that there are cases of items having been devoured ravenously under a minute. Apparently, a lady put out 12 artefacts for free, and they were taken in two ticks of the clock. “Lightening sales and quick disposals have made this a very popular and most sought-after avenue of recycling, for the 2500 residents of this community,” says Ramaswamy, one of the administrators of the group. A list In a written note, Ramaswamy shares a list giving a picture of the kind of used and unused items that over the last three months have been finding ready takers: “School and college textbooks; computer software programme books; computer accessories; used and unused furniture items ranging from a kids table to sofas and dining tables; used and unused electronic household items and kitchen ware ranging from a simple stove to ovens, fridges and ACs and water purifiers; console games, music systems including speakers and MP players and even gramaphone and LP records; guitars, harmoniums, mouth organs, violins, tablas and banjos; baby items such as play mats, cribs and bassinets; CDs of Comics and cartoons along with educational aids like blackboards; and then cycles, two-wheelers and even cars.” Sometimes, a sale can provide a peek into a career and even a life plan. “I came to know that a high-flying executive from the community had retired early when he had put up swanky and elegant Samsonite and Aristocrat suitcases for sale through this forum,” says Ramaswamy. “I believe Declutter Elcot Avenue has come to stay in our community. The virus may go away or not but this viral sale medium has come to stay with us.”  By finding takers for these items within the community itself, the problem of transport is automatically addressed. It would be just a case of moving the items around the complex Benazir Tehrani   This community which has earned accolades and awards for its zero-waste initiatives, jumped at the idea of decongesting their homes and giving away gently used items R.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||The battle for Esa Eri rages||On September 28 this year, Jasraj Nagar and Sai Baba Nagar Residents Welfare Association in Pudupakkam got a reply to its RTI petition that a small piece of land in Pudupakkam village has been identified for dumping garbage. The details about this land have also been clearly spelt out, leaving no room for any ambiguity. But the ground reality is that waste is still being dumped in Esa Eri, a lake in the region. The Association has therefore made a request to the Chengalpet District Collectorate seeking that steps be taken immediately to stop the dumping of garbage in the waterbody and save it. A. Devananth, the Association president, says, “We have been taking up this issue for the past many years. In March 2018, we submitted a petition to the Kancheepuram District Collectorate to prevent dumping of garbage in the lake and for removal of the encroachments in the waterbody. The petition was forwarded by the Collectorate to Thiruporur Tahsildarto take action under State Government Order No:540. Further, at the Grama Sabha meeting held on May 1, 2018, we submitted a petition to the Pudupakkam Village Panchayat, to identify a space to segregate the waste. The Panchayat passed a resolution in this regard. These things were submitted to the Kancheepuram District Collectorate (that was before the bifurcation of the district), seeking that it take necessary steps from its side. But, no action has been taken by the Collectorate. Besides, we sent petitions to the Collectorate seeking further action. We have not received any reply from the Collectorate.” Devananth continues: “Therefore, the Association filed an RTI petition, dated July 25, 2019, with the State Information Commission, seeking to know why there is a delay in identifying a land for source segregation. We also sought to know why the encroachments have not been removed. Only last month we got a reply that land has been identified for dumping waste. However, we find waste being dumped in the lake.” Devananth draws attention to another issue: “The waste pile-ups are set to fire. Therefore, we are unable to keep our doors and windows open. Smoke engulfs our neighbouhood. In addition, we face the menace of flies and mosquitoes.” Efforts to contact the authorities at Chengalpet District Collectorate evoked no response.  “We cannot keep our doors and windows open”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/the-battle-for-esa-eri-rages/article32939273.ece

Beyond the immediate issue that residents were not informed beforehand about this work and it has hindered free movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, there is the larger issue of thrusting stormwater drains on neighbourhoods along East Coast Road (ECR) though they don’t really need them. As the region is endowed with sandy soil which facilitates percolation of rainwater, SWDs are a wasteful superfluity here. ECR did not witness any water-logging even during the massive floods in 2015. The funds earmarked for construction of stormwater drains in this region could be better used in the construction of underground sewage drains and a network of pipes to facilitate water supply. Residents of ECR are badly in need of these two facilities. Or else, culverts and recharge wells can be constructed. In recent times, residents of many localities along ECR have been strongly opposing the construction of SWDs. They have also formed a coalition that includes 30 neighbourhoods.  M.B.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||A new assignment for the traffic police||The Chennai City Traffic Police (CCTP) has launched a novel initiative — Adopt a Road — to ensure road safety and seamless regulation of traffic on accident-prone sections of the city, and the success of the exercise hinges on co-opting residents, motorists and government agencies such as Greater Chennai Corporation, Tangedco and State Highways Department into the initiative. As part of this initiative, inaugurated by City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal a fortnight ago, 65 accident-prone spots have been identified within the Greater Chennai Police Commissionerate limits. Each hotspot will be monitored by a Road Inspector (RI) of the traffic police. “The foremost job of the Road Inspector is to ensure free flow of traffic on the hotspot route and prevent accidents. Residents and local traders are also being roped in to help achieve this objective,” says M. Selvam, Inspector (traffic wing), Valasaravakkam police station. Identification and selection of hotspots are carried out by the respective RIs within the police station limits. The selected hotspots have to be monitored by the RI after ensuring that all required safety measures are tucked into place. For example, two high-definition flash lights were installed between La Chatelaine School and Kesavardhini bus stop in Valasaravakkam on Arcot Road by the RI of Valasaravakkam police station as the carriageway is narrow and without a median. Similarly, Purasawalkam Main Road, between Tana Street intersection and Doveton junction, is a hotspot route where the RI removed illegal parking and roadside eateries to ensure free flow of traffic especially during rush hour. On an average, each hotspot route should cover a distance of at least 100 metres. Besides, every week, a hotspot route should be identified by the RI and it will be the shortlisted hotspot route for that week. Along with previously selected hotspot routes, these new routes should be monitored continually. No time frame has been given for delisting hotspot routes from the routine monitoring exercise. Removal of obstructions, especially encroachments such as those put up by roadside vendors, eateries on footpath, street-light poles, electrical transformers also comes under the purview of the initiative. More importantly, the RI has to also ensure overgrown trees on the hotspot routes are pruned. Actually, such pruning of trees within city limits should be carried out by the civic body. However, as an exception, traffic police personnel are now allowed to carry out this exercise to ensure road safety.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||When your neighbours become foodpreneurs||One floor down; one floor up; and a door away — that was all the stretching they needed to do to find the resources, the homespun wisdom and encouragement required to start a cloud kitchen. To make it less cryptic, in August, amidst the pandemic, Anuradha Nair and her husband Rahul Keshu, teamed up with Deepa Mukherjee (who is Anuradha’s sister) and her husband Saurav Mukherjee and started Tumbo Cafe, a multi-cuisine cloud kitchen, at the gated community they live in. At Mantri Synergy in Padur, these two families reside at the same block, and are only a floor apart. Freya Wilson, a graphic designer by profession who teaches the subject at a college, lives on the same floor as Anuradha, and she was roped in to carry out the design and artwork for Tumbo. “The space where Tumbo is located has so far been let out only for residents, for a nominal rent, to run a cafe for the benefit of the community,” discloses Anuradha. Around the time this space fell vacant, the four could see the debilitating effects of kitchen fatigue all around them. They even had a front-row view of it, having watched members of their own family battling it. Anuradha says she noticed that many of her neighbours were fed up to their finger tips putting on the apron and cooking three meals a day, and they desperately wanted a break, and order at least one meal. “During the intense lockdown, many senior citizens were cooking for themselves, and they found it a dreary business,” says Anuradha. “My father- and mother-in-law, both in their eighties, live alone, on the same floor as my sister Deepa. My mother-in-law would insist that her family would eat only the food made at home, cooked by her, but she was struggling through the cooking. Now, she has started ordering food once in a while.” Anuradha believes there is a distinct advantage to both serving people in your own community, and being served by them. From the foodpreneurs’ point of view, they know many of their customers at a personal level, and which could mean they are in a position to customise the takeouts, without being reminded how to. “There is someone we know who has a kidney ailment, and we know what food he is looking for. So, the same meals will come with less salt and oil for him,” says Anuradha. From the customers’ point of view, it is always reassuring to know that there is nothing set even about a set menu. “We have introduced set menus, but there is nothing cut and dried about it, and we would rework the combo anytime. So, if someone wants just one roti instead of the three that a pre-set menu may specify, we would be naturally inclined to relax the rule. Often, to the greatest extent possible. We cannot lose sight of the fact that we are on a transaction with neighbours.” When you are running a food business in your community, especially among neighbours you know very well, expect impromptu addas. Though Tumbo is a cloud kitchen, it sometimes becomes a space for an “adda”, notes Anuradha. “We offer a full pot of chai in the morning and evening. When we do so, sometimes, before we know it, an adda-like thing would be going on under our nose.” The four also know that in its core, this is an enterprise that has to succeed to justify its existence. So, the line of control are the workflow are clearly defined. Deepa and Saurav are engaged in the day-to-day functioning of the cloud kitchen. Rahul takes care of the part involving the procurement of essential items required daily in the kitchen. Anuradha handles the communications and social media aspects of the enterprise, and is assisted in this work by Freya. The challenge in continuing with household help caused by the pandemic has naturally increased the demand for takeouts. Anuradha says, “There is always going to be a section of the community that would look for outside food.”  During the intense lockdown, many senior citizens were cooking for themselves, and they found it a dreary business||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/when-your-neighbours-become-foodpreneurs/article32939305.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||How a garbage storeroom morphed into an eatery||If you are on Chennai-Thiruvallur High Road, look out for Srivari Café outside Kochar Panchsheel Apartment in Ambattur Industrial Estate. Nothing fanciful about this café, but S. Saravanan promises to delight you with freshly-brewed coffee and his story of hope and resilience. Saravanan was heading South India operations of a major brand until lockdown forced the organisation to close down certain divisions. With his 18 years of corporate experience, Saravanan got ready to start his own business. “The idea of venturing into the food business was always there in my mind but I was not confident of taking the plunge; the lockdown was an opportunity for me to give it a shot,” says Saravanan. His biggest advantage was finding a space to run the café from the comfort of his apartment, Kochar Panchsheel, where he is a resident for the last three years. A 100 sq. ft. space belonging to the apartment association was being used as space to keep waste before it was disposed of. “It is outside the gated community but belongs to the Association so that came as an advantage as we could draw people from inside the community as well as outside,” says Saravanan. The Association was happy to rent it out at a fee as the room was used to dump the garbage collected from every household. After solid waste management was introduced in the society, we were less dependent on this room. “Getting the Association’s consent to use this space came as a timely help. Next, I got the space refurbished and spent close to Rs. 3.5 lakh replacing its tiles, undertaking patchwork on the walls and carrying out other works,” he says. Running the outlet, however, was not a cake walk for this sales executive. Srivari Café opened in August by selling coffee and tea but it was running at a loss for close to a month. So, he added tiffin varieties to the menu but as Saravanan was outsourcing the production there were many challenges along the way. “I hired a person who was without work as the school canteen he was working at was not operating. Things did not go as expected that I even thought if I should give up on this initiative,” he says. The pricing of items seemed to contribute to the poor sales. “I was selling a plate of two idli at Rs. 20 and that was a bit high for auto rickshaw drives and others looking for a quick bite, so I had to rework the rate chart,” he says, adding that he did not compromise on the quality of food. After a short lull, Saravanan hired a new cook. “Serving breakfast as well as coffee/tea has started drawing customers, both from the society and outside,” he says. Many are repeat customers and that includes floating in and out of the locality and those employed at the companies on the stretch. Saravanan is happy with the little progress he is making in the business. Ask him if he plans to return to the corporate world once the economy bounces back, Saravanan says, the satisfaction that he has got in the last couple of months is more than want he earned in the last 18 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/how-a-garbage-storeroom-morphed-into-an-eatery/article32939308.ece

In another instance, in the midst of an online examination, there was a power cut and therefore my grandson could not continue with the exam, and had to reappear for it. Many other residents of Kazura Gardens in Neelankarai on East Coast Road face similar challenges due to frequent power fluctuations and cuts. We have been facing this problem for the past two to three years. For the past six months, the problem has become acute. With people working and studying at home, the power consumption has increased and the transformer meant for our neighbourhood seems to be unable to take the overload. Hence, a transformer with enhanced capacity may be required. Kazura Gadens Residents Welfare Association has been taking up this issue with Tamil Nadu Generation & Distribution Corporation Limited (Tangedco) for the past few years but of no avail. We also request Tangedco to provide us with underground power supply at the earliest. Just a few days ago, line-men from Tangedco carried out their periodical maintenance exercise, but we found a live wire hanging low posing a thereat to the safety of passers-by.

However, the hyacinths have cropped up again and spread all over the lake. They have not not spared the drains either — through these drains, excess water flows from the lake into the Pallikaranai Marsh and the Buckingham canal. If this North-East monsoon is going to witness rains, the localities around the lake will be under sheets of water. So, representing the association, I have sent a telephonic message to the Corporation officials, PWD officials and our elected representatives asking them to attend to this. Besides, the Corporation should take measures to arrest discharge of sewage into the lake. That alone will provide a lasting solution in checking the growth of the water hyacinths. In addition to contaminating the lake, sewage nourishes the water hyacinths,” says S. Kumararaja, an office-bearer of the Association. The Association also pointed out that the stormwater drain on Link Road which runs along Taramani MRTS station to Perungudi MRTS is yet to be desilted.  “Unless the discharge of sewage is arrested, it is not possible to stem the growth of water hyacinths.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/rwa-seeks-removal-of-water-hyacinths-from-velachery-lake/article32939292.ece

The roads in these are muddy with stones protruding and posing a risk to the safety of motorcyclists and pedestrians. When it rains, water remains stagnant on these roads. For years, KAMPERS Welfare Association has made many representations to the Kancheepuram District Collectorate, Block Development Officer, Perumbakkam, St. Thomas Mount Panchayat Union, Chitlapakkam, and Special Officer, Perumbakkam Town Panchayat. But of no avail. No step has been taken till date. Regarding a petition dated April 16, 2018, addressed to Kancheepuram District Collectorate, the BDO had estimated an amount of Rs. 16.05 lakh for the road-relaying work. A copy of the letter, which was sent to the Collectorate, was also given to us. Further, we sent a letter to the Kancheepuram District Collectorate dated June 10 to have the roads relaid. The letter was forwarded to the BDO. A couple of weeks later, the BDO came and inspected the roads. And the BDO requested the Kancheepuram District Collectorate for allocation of funds for the road-relaying work. We sent a petition to the project director, District Rural Development Agencies (DRDA), Kancheepuram, in April 2018. The DRDA had arrived at a cost estimate and promised to relay the roads with the help of a Special Officer, Kancheepuram District Collectorate. But, no action has been taken till date. K.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Gazing into the future||Spool back seven months. At CEEBROS Belvedere, jugaad had broken new ground. Temporary wash basins had come up, one at the entrance, and another in the garden. Connected to Sintex dustbins, these wash basins were a home-brewed idea. Right now, another jugaad is brewing at this gated community on Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) — 28 pedal-operated sanitiser stands are being made in-house. They would soon keep the “temporary” wash basins company. Girish Narayanan, president, CEEBROS Belvedere Owners Association (CBOA) reveals, “We continue to have those wash basins at the gate and in a couple of other places. Besides, at the entrance to each block, a metal-based pedal-operated hand sanitiser stand has been parked. The next plan is to have one such stand at every floor.” Hitting jugaad street The community has seven blocks, each coming with four floors. So, providing sanitiser stands on 28 floors is the target. “The Facilities Management Team is making pedal-operated sanitiser stands themselves instead of buying them from outside. They have already made a few makeshift pedal stands by using PVC pipes,” elaborates Girish, adding that already a couple of makeshift pedal stands made with PVC pipes have been pressed into service. Girish wants to see hand-washing becoming a visible feature of community living, going well beyond the pandemic. Keeping germs of all stripes at bay, at all times, does not hurt anyone. “By keeping a sanitiser stand on each floor, it becomes a more personalised solution for residents of that floor,” says Girish, adding that the pedal-stand project has invited sponsorships. At the OSR park which comes paired with playthings, a stage and a basketball court that doubles as a badminton court, a permanent wash basin is set to be installed. Water and soap would be kept at the facility. “The idea is that anyone entering the OSR area washes their hands, and washes again before leaving,” he says. “It is mandated and will be a permanent feature.” A major reason for having a permanent sanitisation station at the OSR park is to protect children from other infections as well, he points out. “Children can carry scabies, picking it from the mud. When they come home, they may immediately take a snack, forgetting to wash their hands. If we mandate washing of hands at the park itself, we ensure that kids are going to do it.” Though Girish would like to say that the pedal-operated sanitiser stands would also be a permanent feature, he chooses to puts a guarded and realistic number to the initiative, for the time being. “For another one year, at the least.”  Gateway to safety  A rack at the entrance of gated communities is a symbol of these times. Where deliveries are concerned, a great number of communities want to keep the exercise restricted to the gate for some more time to come. Many of them have gone in for a rack to make the collection process safer and easier. “Three months ago, we kept a simple cost-effective rack at the gate, and it has changed the workflow and increased social distancing and minimised the time of contact between the community’s security staff and delivery professionals. Delivery persons straightaway keep these parcels on the racks. The security staff only have to hand it over when residents come to collect it,” says Suresh Dhayaalan, secretary, Victoria Towers Owners Welfare Association. “There is a likelihood of this prop becoming a permanent feature,” adds Suresh, whose gated community is in Kazhipattur, OMR. Even after communities feel safe about accepting deliveries on the doorsteps, will they offer the option of a safe facility at the gate where these can be deposited for collection? If they do become a permanent feature, would these collection racks get more sophisticated, even evolving into a fool-proof locker system? Or would collection facilities be integrated into the construction, and made up of brick and mortar? The pandemic has left us with more questions than answers, with many sure-footed answer stumbling along the way. One observable feature is that, at this point in time, as communities try to streamline the deliveries collection process, many of them are prepared to spare some generous real estate and metal for it. “We want to have the deliveries made at the gate for at least one more year. We have cleared a storeroom of electrical fittings — hardly ten metres from the gate — and are using it to keep the deliveries. We are going to place seven racks inside this room, one dedicated rack for each block. The delivery person would deliver the goods at the gate; collecting it, the security staff will place it in the appropriate rack, and inform the resident concerned. Residents have to collect their deliveries,” says Girish. Wheel in a feature  One adjustment often necessitates other adjustments. At Appaswamy Cityside in Kandanchavady, a trolley used by the housekeeping staff for their work has been repurposed as a vehicle to transport deliveries to residents’ doorsteps. “As the grabage collection bins come with wheels, we decided the trolley could be spared to meet a new exigency. The trolley is kept at the gate and when a heavy item or a collection of items have been delivered, and the resident concerned cannot lug it all the way back to their home, they could use the trolley,” says Rabiya Aftab, Association president at Appaswamy Cityside. “We may go in for one more trolley for this purpose. As we are just a 136-unit apartment, two trolleys would do.” Though at present, the security staff wheel in deliveries for senior citizens at the community, Rabiya thinks after the pandemic, seniors may even want to exercise this option themselves, that is if the system of delivery of goods at the gate is allowed to continue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/gazing-into-the-future/article32939335.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Have you ever considered putting your community on a ‘declutter’ diet?||Things bought on a whim and ignored after the initial enthusiasm is past. Things flaunted a gazillion times and therefore, cannot be flaunted anymore. Declutter Elcot Avenue (DEA) rockets such items back into the orbit of usefulness through a community-driven reusing exercise. An initiative at Elcot Avenue in Sholinganallur, it transfers used and unused items rendered useless in one pair of hands to another pair that values it. It is for the owner to decide whether to offer an item for free or a price. Benazir Tehrani started DEA onWhatsAppduring lockdown when she realised her universe would not shrink into insignificance if it shed some non-essentials and essentials and those things that lay in-between. High up on the list was a telescope admittedly bought in a fit of impetuousness for her daughter, and put on star-gazing duty as frequently as the exoplanet Gliese 581g is visited. In plain terms, it remained unused. With many of her neighbours in Elcot Avenue and Kumaraswamy Nagar, Sholinganallur, similarly identifying forgotten, dusty items, DEA has become a community initiative. R. Ramaswamy, president of Clasic Farms Owners and Residents Association and Secretary-cum-Treasurer of Clasic Gardens Owners Association, Kumarasamy Nagar, puts it this way: “This community which has earned accolades and awards for its zero-waste initiatives, jumped at the idea of decongesting their homes and giving away gently used items.” He adds: The families went on a “Treasure Hunt” looking for items that can be recirculated. “Nobody can promote any business in this group,” states Benazir. “It is a platform for recycling and reusing used items.” Benazir explains that at first, the initiative reached out to three NGOs by donating old clothes for them to make masks. “We were donating bags and bags of clothes. But how long can we be giving away only clothes?” says Benazir. By then, she realised it would be great idea to try to tackle a challenge people faced while relocating. These people struggled to find takers for items they wanted sold quickly for a nominal price. In the middle of Chennai’s information-technology heartland, Elcot Avenue with its mix of gated communities and independent bungalows, often has a family relocating abroad or to a different Indian metro on work. Benazir says many a time she has noticed huge mattresses in good condition being thrown by the side of garbage bins. “When I would try to find out the reason, I would invariably learn that there were no takers for these things. Sometimes, in our car park, there would be items abandoned by a family that is moving out,” says Benazir, who lives in a gated community. “By finding takers for these items within the community itself, the problem of transport is automatically addressed. It would be just a case of moving the items around the complex.” Benazir admits to being inspired by a couple of community-driven “decluttering” initiatives in Mumbai. Under the overpowering shadow of the pandemic, there is always a risk attached to people dropping in to inspect items offered for sale (or for free), how is the safety question addressed? Benazir says “everyone takes responsibility for maintaining social distancing and sanitising” and meeting all the necessary safety requirements. The group has largely restricted DEA to Elcot Avenue and surrounding areas, because, as Benazir puts it, the community here has a strong three R’s culture (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle). Strict guidelines The WhatsApp group is not operated by a laundry list of guidelines; but from what the admins say about the ones in operation, these are cut in gabbro-stone. “Anyone offering an used item and those keen on buying it can’t have a discussion over the sale in the group. They have to take the transaction to their private chat. We also don’t encourage too much talk, and so, anyone posting an item should present one or more pics (in a collage) and pair it to a short description along with a mention of the price,” elaborates Benazir. There are regular instances of an owners of an item choosing to just give it away, for free. “My daughter had a huge telescope costing Rs. 5,500, which we had bought on a whim and a fancy, and we knew she was not going to use it. I said I was not going to sell it, but give it away to a child who was really interested in astronomy. So, I asked if anyone was interested and asked them to message me. I said I would speak to the child to gauge their interest in astronomy. One child was identified, and the telescope was given free to her,” says Benazir. She notes that there are cases of items having been devoured ravenously under a minute. Apparently, a lady put out 12 artefacts for free, and they were taken in two ticks of the clock. “Lightening sales and quick disposals have made this a very popular and most sought-after avenue of recycling, for the 2500 residents of this community,” says Ramaswamy, one of the administrators of the group. A list In a written note, Ramaswamy shares a list giving a picture of the kind of used and unused items that over the last three months have been finding ready takers: “School and college textbooks; computer software programme books; computer accessories; used and unused furniture items ranging from a kids table to sofas and dining tables; used and unused electronic household items and kitchen ware ranging from a simple stove to ovens, fridges and ACs and water purifiers; console games, music systems including speakers and MP players and even gramaphone and LP records; guitars, harmoniums, mouth organs, violins, tablas and banjos; baby items such as play mats, cribs and bassinets; CDs of Comics and cartoons along with educational aids like blackboards; and then cycles, two-wheelers and even cars.” Sometimes, a sale can provide a peek into a career and even a life plan. “I came to know that a high-flying executive from the community had retired early when he had put up swanky and elegant Samsonite and Aristocrat suitcases for sale through this forum,” says Ramaswamy. “I believe Declutter Elcot Avenue has come to stay in our community. The virus may go away or not but this viral sale medium has come to stay with us.”  By finding takers for these items within the community itself, the problem of transport is automatically addressed. It would be just a case of moving the items around the complex Benazir Tehrani   This community which has earned accolades and awards for its zero-waste initiatives, jumped at the idea of decongesting their homes and giving away gently used items R.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||How it can serve motorists better||The service lane along Chennai Bypass Road in Nolambur has been registering frequent accidents — fortunately, minor ones — since lockdown restrictions were considerably eased. A majority of these accidents have occurred at night. An open drain, poor lighting and a narrow carriageway are contributory factors. Many motorists from Ambattur, Korattur, Athipet, Ayyapakkam, Pattaravakkam and Puzhal use the narrow service lane along the Chennai Bypass as it connects to the Poonamallee High (PH) Road at Koyambedu via Mogappair East and West. To avoid taking Ambattur Industrial Estate Main Road and hitting Maduravoyal junction due to the traffic congestion prevailing there, many motorists choose to take this stretch. “Better street lights, reflectors and bunds along the open drain would help prevent accidents,” says S. Vikram, a motorist from Nolambur. The police booth, which acts as a checkpost for monitoring the movement of vehicles, especially two-wheelers, was established in 2014 as part of the larger exercise by the city police to have a permanent police presence at strategic locations and crucial arterial roads in the neighbourhood. Fifteen such spots were identified by the police and the list covered J.J. Nagar, Mogappair, Nolambur and Thirumangalam. However, motorists and residents point out that the police booth does not have adequate police personnel, especially at night, to monitor the movement of vehicles. The existing police booth is surrounded by thick bushes and the carriageway around it marked by potholes, betraying poor maintenance. Further, wrong-way driving by motorists, especially at night, endangers the safety of other motorists taking the service lane.   As most of the roads in Nolambur are less congested, it makes it easy for offenders to escape easily after committing the crime — so security and safety must be enhanced, say residents. “Steps will be taken to install safety features on the service lane soon,” says a Corporation official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/how-it-can-serve-motorists-better/article32939324.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||A new assignment for the traffic police||The Chennai City Traffic Police (CCTP) has launched a novel initiative — Adopt a Road — to ensure road safety and seamless regulation of traffic on accident-prone sections of the city, and the success of the exercise hinges on co-opting residents, motorists and government agencies such as Greater Chennai Corporation, Tangedco and State Highways Department into the initiative. As part of this initiative, inaugurated by City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal a fortnight ago, 65 accident-prone spots have been identified within the Greater Chennai Police Commissionerate limits. Each hotspot will be monitored by a Road Inspector (RI) of the traffic police. “The foremost job of the Road Inspector is to ensure free flow of traffic on the hotspot route and prevent accidents. Residents and local traders are also being roped in to help achieve this objective,” says M. Selvam, Inspector (traffic wing), Valasaravakkam police station. Identification and selection of hotspots are carried out by the respective RIs within the police station limits. The selected hotspots have to be monitored by the RI after ensuring that all required safety measures are tucked into place. For example, two high-definition flash lights were installed between La Chatelaine School and Kesavardhini bus stop in Valasaravakkam on Arcot Road by the RI of Valasaravakkam police station as the carriageway is narrow and without a median. Similarly, Purasawalkam Main Road, between Tana Street intersection and Doveton junction, is a hotspot route where the RI removed illegal parking and roadside eateries to ensure free flow of traffic especially during rush hour. On an average, each hotspot route should cover a distance of at least 100 metres. Besides, every week, a hotspot route should be identified by the RI and it will be the shortlisted hotspot route for that week. Along with previously selected hotspot routes, these new routes should be monitored continually. No time frame has been given for delisting hotspot routes from the routine monitoring exercise. Removal of obstructions, especially encroachments such as those put up by roadside vendors, eateries on footpath, street-light poles, electrical transformers also comes under the purview of the initiative. More importantly, the RI has to also ensure overgrown trees on the hotspot routes are pruned. Actually, such pruning of trees within city limits should be carried out by the civic body. However, as an exception, traffic police personnel are now allowed to carry out this exercise to ensure road safety.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Uncleared debris comes in handy||Construction debris lying uncleared after a work has always been an irritant for residents. There are exceptions though. And this exception to the rule involves residents of an area whose defining feature is that it is overlooked by the Thirumangalam bridge. They have found these leftover materials coming to their rescue. Over 150 families, a majority of them wage labourers working at construction sites, live with hardly any basic facilities in this area, which is tucked between Koyambedu Metro Rail station and the bridge along the Cooum river. Whenever the Cooum on this section registers a rise in water level, the area comes under sheets of water, which forces these residents to move to the Corporation-run night shelters and community centres. This time around, a section of the people used the debris left behind to prevent inundation of their area. It was a year ago since the State Highways Department undertook the work of installing new tiles on the damaged footpath on the small bridge. The replaced old and broken tiles were dumped on both sides of the bridge. “We can’t afford to buy construction debris to level the narrow lanes in our area, and so we decided to make use of the dumped debris and carried out the levelling work,” explains S. Muniswamy, a resident. With the city and its outskirts witnessing frequent rains in the recent weeks, residents of neighbourhood decided to increase the height of the streets by at least one foot above the bund of the river to prevent inundation. Dividing themselves into small teams of three each, a group of residents were on the bridge to take and pass the debris while the rest were below the bridge to level the streets.Residents also cleaned the existing open stormwater drains to allow excess rainwater to flow freely to the river. The entire exercise of levelling the streets with footpath debris took a few hours of work. “Most of the men in the neighbourhood did not go for work on that day as they had to do the levelling work. In fact, they contributed their day’s earnings in terms of their labour for the common good,” notes a Corporation official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/uncleared-debris-comes-in-handy/article32939318.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Key road is now a victim of half measures||Road-levelling work on Paper Mills Road in Thiru Vi Ka Nagar illustrates the harm that doing things by half measures can cause. On the side of the road where the traffic moves towards Perambur, water pipeline work was started by the Chennai Metrowater more than a month ago and completed recently. With rains, this section of the road is fraught with danger for motorists as the unlevelled portion turns slushy and slippery. The damaged portion has been levelled with leftover sand. Many motorists from Kolathur, Agaram, Madhavaram Milk Colony, Mathur, Moolakadai, Majambakkam, Red Hills and Puzhal use the stretch to reach central parts of the city. Paper Mills Road is part of a short route to these areas, and is therefore chosen over the congested CTH Road and Konnur High Road. “The damaged stretch should be relaid immediately as many motorists especially those driving at night have suffered skids due to its uneven surface,” says K. Vinukumar, a motorist from Kolathur. Most road users use a narrow space on the damaged portion as a two-way route due to the damaged portion of stretch being slushy. As a result, traffic movement is sluggish during rush hour. Paper Mills Road is a key MTC bus route with all buses heading to the terminus in Thiru Vi Ka Nagar using the stretch to reach places like Kolathur, Retteri, Anna Nagar, Puzhal, Perambur, Purasawalkam and CMBT in Koyambedu. A lone traffic police personnel has been deployed to regulate traffic especially at Four Cross Road Junction. As per the existing traffic arrangement, vehicles from Paper Mills Road take a right turn below the flyover to reach areas like Jamaliya and Ayanavaram through the subway. Similarly, motorists coming from Perambur Main Road have to come straight below the flyover to reach Paper Mills Road. The ramp of the flyover from Paper Mills Road and Perambur Main Road can be reached via the subway. With work to widen the stretch put in cold storage for many years due to challenges related to land acquisition, Paper Mills Road remains narrow. The stretch does not have a wide footpath, a median, or a lane for buses at four bus stops, reflectors and speed breakers. A small concrete slab has been placed on the stretch for a distance of up to 200 metres to prevent motorists from jumping on to the opposite lane especially during rush hour.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||When your neighbours become foodpreneurs||One floor down; one floor up; and a door away — that was all the stretching they needed to do to find the resources, the homespun wisdom and encouragement required to start a cloud kitchen. To make it less cryptic, in August, amidst the pandemic, Anuradha Nair and her husband Rahul Keshu, teamed up with Deepa Mukherjee (who is Anuradha’s sister) and her husband Saurav Mukherjee and started Tumbo Cafe, a multi-cuisine cloud kitchen, at the gated community they live in. At Mantri Synergy in Padur, these two families reside at the same block, and are only a floor apart. Freya Wilson, a graphic designer by profession who teaches the subject at a college, lives on the same floor as Anuradha, and she was roped in to carry out the design and artwork for Tumbo. “The space where Tumbo is located has so far been let out only for residents, for a nominal rent, to run a cafe for the benefit of the community,” discloses Anuradha. Around the time this space fell vacant, the four could see the debilitating effects of kitchen fatigue all around them. They even had a front-row view of it, having watched members of their own family battling it. Anuradha says she noticed that many of her neighbours were fed up to their finger tips putting on the apron and cooking three meals a day, and they desperately wanted a break, and order at least one meal. “During the intense lockdown, many senior citizens were cooking for themselves, and they found it a dreary business,” says Anuradha. “My father- and mother-in-law, both in their eighties, live alone, on the same floor as my sister Deepa. My mother-in-law would insist that her family would eat only the food made at home, cooked by her, but she was struggling through the cooking. Now, she has started ordering food once in a while.” Anuradha believes there is a distinct advantage to both serving people in your own community, and being served by them. From the foodpreneurs’ point of view, they know many of their customers at a personal level, and which could mean they are in a position to customise the takeouts, without being reminded how to. “There is someone we know who has a kidney ailment, and we know what food he is looking for. So, the same meals will come with less salt and oil for him,” says Anuradha. From the customers’ point of view, it is always reassuring to know that there is nothing set even about a set menu. “We have introduced set menus, but there is nothing cut and dried about it, and we would rework the combo anytime. So, if someone wants just one roti instead of the three that a pre-set menu may specify, we would be naturally inclined to relax the rule. Often, to the greatest extent possible. We cannot lose sight of the fact that we are on a transaction with neighbours.” When you are running a food business in your community, especially among neighbours you know very well, expect impromptu addas. Though Tumbo is a cloud kitchen, it sometimes becomes a space for an “adda”, notes Anuradha. “We offer a full pot of chai in the morning and evening. When we do so, sometimes, before we know it, an adda-like thing would be going on under our nose.” The four also know that in its core, this is an enterprise that has to succeed to justify its existence. So, the line of control are the workflow are clearly defined. Deepa and Saurav are engaged in the day-to-day functioning of the cloud kitchen. Rahul takes care of the part involving the procurement of essential items required daily in the kitchen. Anuradha handles the communications and social media aspects of the enterprise, and is assisted in this work by Freya. The challenge in continuing with household help caused by the pandemic has naturally increased the demand for takeouts. Anuradha says, “There is always going to be a section of the community that would look for outside food.”  During the intense lockdown, many senior citizens were cooking for themselves, and they found it a dreary business||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/when-your-neighbours-become-foodpreneurs/article32939336.ece

Nothing fanciful about this café, but S. Saravanan promises to delight you with freshly-brewed coffee and his story of hope and resilience. Saravanan was heading South India operations of a major brand until lockdown forced the organisation to close down certain divisions. With his 18 years of corporate experience, Saravanan got ready to start his own business. “The idea of venturing into the food business was always there in my mind but I was not confident of taking the plunge; the lockdown was an opportunity for me to give it a shot,” says Saravanan. His biggest advantage was finding a space to run the café from the comfort of his apartment, Kochar Panchsheel, where he is a resident for the last three years. A 100 sq. ft. space belonging to the apartment association was being used as space to keep waste before it was disposed of. “It is outside the gated community but belongs to the Association so that came as an advantage as we could draw people from inside the community as well as outside,” says Saravanan. The Association was happy to rent it out at a fee as the room was used to dump the garbage collected from every household. After solid waste management was introduced in the society, we were less dependent on this room. “Getting the Association’s consent to use this space came as a timely help. Next, I got the space refurbished and spent close to Rs. 3.5 lakh replacing its tiles, undertaking patchwork on the walls and carrying out other works,” he says. Running the outlet, however, was not a cake walk for this sales executive. Srivari Café opened in August by selling coffee and tea but it was running at a loss for close to a month. So, he added tiffin varieties to the menu but as Saravanan was outsourcing the production there were many challenges along the way. “I hired a person who was without work as the school canteen he was working at was not operating. Things did not go as expected that I even thought if I should give up on this initiative,” he says. The pricing of items seemed to contribute to the poor sales. “I was selling a plate of two idli at Rs. 20 and that was a bit high for auto rickshaw drives and others looking for a quick bite, so I had to rework the rate chart,” he says, adding that he did not compromise on the quality of food. After a short lull, Saravanan hired a new cook. “Serving breakfast as well as coffee/tea has started drawing customers, both from the society and outside,” he says. Many are repeat customers and that includes floating in and out of the locality and those employed at the companies on the stretch. Saravanan is happy with the little progress he is making in the business. Ask him if he plans to return to the corporate world once the economy bounces back, Saravanan says, the satisfaction that he has got in the last couple of months is more than want he earned in the last 18 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/how-a-garbage-storeroom-morphed-into-an-eatery/article32939337.ece

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Gazing into the future||Spool back seven months. At CEEBROS Belvedere, jugaad had broken new ground. Temporary wash basins had come up, one at the entrance, and another in the garden. Connected to Sintex dustbins, these wash basins were a home-brewed idea. Right now, another jugaad is brewing at this gated community on Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) — 28 pedal-operated sanitiser stands are being made in-house. They would soon keep the “temporary” wash basins company. Girish Narayanan, president, CEEBROS Belvedere Owners Association (CBOA) reveals, “We continue to have those wash basins at the gate and in a couple of other places. Besides, at the entrance to each block, a metal-based pedal-operated hand sanitiser stand has been parked. The next plan is to have one such stand at every floor.” Hitting jugaad street The community has seven blocks, each coming with four floors. So, providing sanitiser stands on 28 floors is the target. “The Facilities Management Team is making pedal-operated sanitiser stands themselves instead of buying them from outside. They have already made a few makeshift pedal stands by using PVC pipes,” elaborates Girish, adding that already a couple of makeshift pedal stands made with PVC pipes have been pressed into service. Girish wants to see hand-washing becoming a visible feature of community living, going well beyond the pandemic. Keeping germs of all stripes at bay, at all times, does not hurt anyone. “By keeping a sanitiser stand on each floor, it becomes a more personalised solution for residents of that floor,” says Girish, adding that the pedal-stand project has invited sponsorships. At the OSR park which comes paired with playthings, a stage and a basketball court that doubles as a badminton court, a permanent wash basin is set to be installed. Water and soap would be kept at the facility. “The idea is that anyone entering the OSR area washes their hands, and washes again before leaving,” he says. “It is mandated and will be a permanent feature.” A major reason for having a permanent sanitisation station at the OSR park is to protect children from other infections as well, he points out. “Children can carry scabies, picking it from the mud. When they come home, they may immediately take a snack, forgetting to wash their hands. If we mandate washing of hands at the park itself, we ensure that kids are going to do it.” Though Girish would like to say that the pedal-operated sanitiser stands would also be a permanent feature, he chooses to puts a guarded and realistic number to the initiative, for the time being. “For another one year, at the least.”  Gateway to safety  A rack at the entrance of gated communities is a symbol of these times. Where deliveries are concerned, a great number of communities want to keep the exercise restricted to the gate for some more time to come. Many of them have gone in for a rack to make the collection process safer and easier. “Three months ago, we kept a simple cost-effective rack at the gate, and it has changed the workflow and increased social distancing and minimised the time of contact between the community’s security staff and delivery professionals. Delivery persons straightaway keep these parcels on the racks. The security staff only have to hand it over when residents come to collect it,” says Suresh Dhayaalan, secretary, Victoria Towers Owners Welfare Association. “There is a likelihood of this prop becoming a permanent feature,” adds Suresh, whose gated community is in Kazhipattur, OMR. Even after communities feel safe about accepting deliveries on the doorsteps, will they offer the option of a safe facility at the gate where these can be deposited for collection? If they do become a permanent feature, would these collection racks get more sophisticated, even evolving into a fool-proof locker system? Or would collection facilities be integrated into the construction, and made up of brick and mortar? The pandemic has left us with more questions than answers, with many sure-footed answer stumbling along the way. One observable feature is that, at this point in time, as communities try to streamline the deliveries collection process, many of them are prepared to spare some generous real estate and metal for it. “We want to have the deliveries made at the gate for at least one more year. We have cleared a storeroom of electrical fittings — hardly ten metres from the gate — and are using it to keep the deliveries. We are going to place seven racks inside this room, one dedicated rack for each block. The delivery person would deliver the goods at the gate; collecting it, the security staff will place it in the appropriate rack, and inform the resident concerned. Residents have to collect their deliveries,” says Girish. Wheel in a feature  One adjustment often necessitates other adjustments. At Appaswamy Cityside in Kandanchavady, a trolley used by the housekeeping staff for their work has been repurposed as a vehicle to transport deliveries to residents’ doorsteps. “As the grabage collection bins come with wheels, we decided the trolley could be spared to meet a new exigency. The trolley is kept at the gate and when a heavy item or a collection of items have been delivered, and the resident concerned cannot lug it all the way back to their home, they could use the trolley,” says Rabiya Aftab, Association president at Appaswamy Cityside. “We may go in for one more trolley for this purpose. As we are just a 136-unit apartment, two trolleys would do.” Though at present, the security staff wheel in deliveries for senior citizens at the community, Rabiya thinks after the pandemic, seniors may even want to exercise this option themselves, that is if the system of delivery of goods at the gate is allowed to continue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/gazing-into-the-future/article32939372.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Have you ever considered putting your community on a ‘declutter’ diet?||Things bought on a whim and ignored after the initial enthusiasm is past. Things flaunted a gazillion times and therefore, cannot be flaunted anymore. Declutter Elcot Avenue (DEA) rockets such items back into the orbit of usefulness through a community-driven reusing exercise. An initiative at Elcot Avenue in Sholinganallur, it transfers used and unused items rendered useless in one pair of hands to another pair that values it. It is for the owner to decide whether to offer an item for free or a price. Benazir Tehrani started DEA onWhatsAppduring lockdown when she realised her universe would not shrink into insignificance if it shed some non-essentials and essentials and those things that lay in-between. High up on the list was a telescope admittedly bought in a fit of impetuousness for her daughter, and put on star-gazing duty as frequently as the exoplanet Gliese 581g is visited. In plain terms, it remained unused. With many of her neighbours in Elcot Avenue and Kumaraswamy Nagar, Sholinganallur, similarly identifying forgotten, dusty items, DEA has become a community initiative. R. Ramaswamy, president of Clasic Farms Owners and Residents Association and Secretary-cum-Treasurer of Clasic Gardens Owners Association, Kumarasamy Nagar, puts it this way: “This community which has earned accolades and awards for its zero-waste initiatives, jumped at the idea of decongesting their homes and giving away gently used items.” He adds: The families went on a “Treasure Hunt” looking for items that can be recirculated. “Nobody can promote any business in this group,” states Benazir. “It is a platform for recycling and reusing used items.” Benazir explains that at first, the initiative reached out to three NGOs by donating old clothes for them to make masks. “We were donating bags and bags of clothes. But how long can we be giving away only clothes?” says Benazir. By then, she realised it would be great idea to try to tackle a challenge people faced while relocating. These people struggled to find takers for items they wanted sold quickly for a nominal price. In the middle of Chennai’s information-technology heartland, Elcot Avenue with its mix of gated communities and independent bungalows, often has a family relocating abroad or to a different Indian metro on work. Benazir says many a time she has noticed huge mattresses in good condition being thrown by the side of garbage bins. “When I would try to find out the reason, I would invariably learn that there were no takers for these things. Sometimes, in our car park, there would be items abandoned by a family that is moving out,” says Benazir, who lives in a gated community. “By finding takers for these items within the community itself, the problem of transport is automatically addressed. It would be just a case of moving the items around the complex.” Benazir admits to being inspired by a couple of community-driven “decluttering” initiatives in Mumbai. Under the overpowering shadow of the pandemic, there is always a risk attached to people dropping in to inspect items offered for sale (or for free), how is the safety question addressed? Benazir says “everyone takes responsibility for maintaining social distancing and sanitising” and meeting all the necessary safety requirements. The group has largely restricted DEA to Elcot Avenue and surrounding areas, because, as Benazir puts it, the community here has a strong three R’s culture (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle). Strict guidelines The WhatsApp group is not operated by a laundry list of guidelines; but from what the admins say about the ones in operation, these are cut in gabbro-stone. “Anyone offering an used item and those keen on buying it can’t have a discussion over the sale in the group. They have to take the transaction to their private chat. We also don’t encourage too much talk, and so, anyone posting an item should present one or more pics (in a collage) and pair it to a short description along with a mention of the price,” elaborates Benazir. There are regular instances of an owners of an item choosing to just give it away, for free. “My daughter had a huge telescope costing Rs. 5,500, which we had bought on a whim and a fancy, and we knew she was not going to use it. I said I was not going to sell it, but give it away to a child who was really interested in astronomy. So, I asked if anyone was interested and asked them to message me. I said I would speak to the child to gauge their interest in astronomy. One child was identified, and the telescope was given free to her,” says Benazir. She notes that there are cases of items having been devoured ravenously under a minute. Apparently, a lady put out 12 artefacts for free, and they were taken in two ticks of the clock. “Lightening sales and quick disposals have made this a very popular and most sought-after avenue of recycling, for the 2500 residents of this community,” says Ramaswamy, one of the administrators of the group. A list In a written note, Ramaswamy shares a list giving a picture of the kind of used and unused items that over the last three months have been finding ready takers: “School and college textbooks; computer software programme books; computer accessories; used and unused furniture items ranging from a kids table to sofas and dining tables; used and unused electronic household items and kitchen ware ranging from a simple stove to ovens, fridges and ACs and water purifiers; console games, music systems including speakers and MP players and even gramaphone and LP records; guitars, harmoniums, mouth organs, violins, tablas and banjos; baby items such as play mats, cribs and bassinets; CDs of Comics and cartoons along with educational aids like blackboards; and then cycles, two-wheelers and even cars.” Sometimes, a sale can provide a peek into a career and even a life plan. “I came to know that a high-flying executive from the community had retired early when he had put up swanky and elegant Samsonite and Aristocrat suitcases for sale through this forum,” says Ramaswamy. “I believe Declutter Elcot Avenue has come to stay in our community. The virus may go away or not but this viral sale medium has come to stay with us.”  By finding takers for these items within the community itself, the problem of transport is automatically addressed. It would be just a case of moving the items around the complex Benazir Tehrani   This community which has earned accolades and awards for its zero-waste initiatives, jumped at the idea of decongesting their homes and giving away gently used items R.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Uncleared debris comes in handy||Construction debris lying uncleared after a work has always been an irritant for residents. There are exceptions though. And this exception to the rule involves residents of an area whose defining feature is that it is overlooked by the Thirumangalam bridge. They have found these leftover materials coming to their rescue. Over 150 families, a majority of them wage labourers working at construction sites, live with hardly any basic facilities in this area, which is tucked between Koyambedu Metro Rail station and the bridge along the Cooum river. Whenever the Cooum on this section registers a rise in water level, the area comes under sheets of water, which forces these residents to move to the Corporation-run night shelters and community centres. This time around, a section of the people used the debris left behind to prevent inundation of their area. It was a year ago since the State Highways Department undertook the work of installing new tiles on the damaged footpath on the small bridge. The replaced old and broken tiles were dumped on both sides of the bridge. “We can’t afford to buy construction debris to level the narrow lanes in our area, and so we decided to make use of the dumped debris and carried out the levelling work,” explains S. Muniswamy, a resident. With the city and its outskirts witnessing frequent rains in the recent weeks, residents of neighbourhood decided to increase the height of the streets by at least one foot above the bund of the river to prevent inundation. Dividing themselves into small teams of three each, a group of residents were on the bridge to take and pass the debris while the rest were below the bridge to level the streets.Residents also cleaned the existing open stormwater drains to allow excess rainwater to flow freely to the river. The entire exercise of levelling the streets with footpath debris took a few hours of work. “Most of the men in the neighbourhood did not go for work on that day as they had to do the levelling work. In fact, they contributed their day’s earnings in terms of their labour for the common good,” notes a Corporation official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/uncleared-debris-comes-in-handy/article32939379.ece

Misused for dumping waste, it is an eyesore and a health hazard.“It is mainly because of a vacant plot. As it has not been fenced, many people started dumping garbage in it. The garbage would spill on to the footpath. As it got dirty, gradually, people started to dump the garbage on the pavement also,” says K. Gokul, a resident of Kundrathur. Further, stray cattle and dogs feed on the garbage that piles up on this section, say residents This section of Porur–Kundrathur Main Road is narrow, and with the footpath rendered unusable due to the garbage, pedestrians have to step on to the road to continue walking. During rush hour, this would put them at high risk for accidents. Road widening Certain sections of Porur–Kundrathur Main Road were widened in 2019 by the State Highways department to convert the existing two-lane stretch into a four-lane. It was done based on the availability of space on both sides of the road. Those sections include the four cross junctions found on the section from Kundrathur to Kovur and the section from Kovur to Gerugambakkam. As part of this work, encroachments such as makeshift outlets, found between Kundrathur and Kovur, were removed. Now, stormwater drains are being expanded. Further, culverts on accident -prone sections between Kundrathur and Gerugambakkam. The spots include the narrow cure near Kovur bus terminus and Moulivakkam junction. The culverts are aimed to prevent flooding in the big neighbourhoods like Kundrathur, Porur, Valasaravakkam and Ramapuram from Chembarambakkam lake. The widened stretch got concrete median, tiled footpath, LED street lights, speed-breakers with zebra-markings, reflectors and pedestrian-crossings. Residents of Kovur, Gerugambakkam, Mugalivakkam, Mangadu, Poonamallee, Kattupakkam, Iyyapanthangal, Somangalam, Kundrathur, Chembarambakkam and Porur use this main road to reach various parts of the city. Also, people from villages like Kollachery, Arambedu, Erumaiyur, Kavanoor, Kolambakkam, Poonthandalam and Vaipoor use this road to take their farm produce to the wholesale market in Koyambedu via Porur. Further, it is a shorter route to reach the Bangalore Highway (NH-04) via Kundrathur than the congested Poonamallee High Road. However, the footpath on such an important road is in a sorry state. “Steps will be taken to prevent such dumping of garbage on the footpath,” says a State Highways official.  “It is mainly because of a vacant plot. As it has not been fenced, many people started dumping garbage in it. The garbage would spill on to the footpath. As it got dirty, people started to dump the garbage on the pavement also.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/footpath-near-moulivakkam-junction-triggers-nausea/article32939370.ece

Called “Adopting A Road”, the exercise is a call to improve traffic conditions in 65 areas known to consistently report more accidents than most others. With Poonamallee figuring in the list, certain spots and roads in the locality are inviting measures to neautralise factors that contribute to accidents. Installation of reflective signboards and reflectors, placing of steel barricades and creation of zebra crossings are among the notable measures to be taken in these spots and roads. Besides, the focus would also be on checking encroachments and illegal parking. There is already some noticeable intervention at Link Road (which connects Mount-Poonamallee Main Road with Poonamallee High Road), Mangadu intersection, Kattupakkam, Poonamallee Bypass and Kundrathur Main Road. Each hotspot will be monitored by a traffic inspector within its limits. “Apart from roads, key junctions, intersections and narrow bends that require safety intervention have been identified,” says N. Ramesh, Inspector, Poonamallee Traffic Enforcement. The accident-prone spot and the nearby section, up to a distance of 500 metres, will be the focus of correctional measures. The “Adopting A Road” initiative would require the traffic police to work closely with the other government agencies to ensure changes are effected. For instance, to make sure these hotspots have concrete median, sufficient lighting, are rid of litter, and are not plagued by stray animals, the traffic police have to interact with the respective local bodies and government agencies. “This initiative requires us to persuade other government departments including State Highways Department, the local bodies, Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (Tangedco) and the Revenue Department to effect certain changes. We have roped in residents and shopkeepers for the initiative,” says N. Ramesh, Inspector, Poonamallee Traffic Enforcement. The local traffic police have to push for implementation of the necessary safety measures at the routine monthly inter-departmental meetings attended by all stakeholders, mostly government agencies. The work by the local traffic police is being monitored by the City Police Commissionerate with a special traffic police team that will pay surprise visits to the hotspots to assess the impact of the initiative. “Every day, we upload photos and videos of the measures being taken within our limits to the WhatsApp group of the city traffic police. Following these inputs, they will carry out a verification exercise independently,” says Ramesh. On an average, each stretch and junction will be monitored for a month before the local traffic police adopt another stretch that is also in the list. However, regular updates about the situation in stretches and spots covered earlier should be presented to the City Police Commissionerate.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||When your neighbours become foodpreneurs||One floor down; one floor up; and a door away — that was all the stretching they needed to do to find the resources, the homespun wisdom and encouragement required to start a cloud kitchen. To make it less cryptic, in August, amidst the pandemic, Anuradha Nair and her husband Rahul Keshu, teamed up with Deepa Mukherjee (who is Anuradha’s sister) and her husband Saurav Mukherjee and started Tumbo Cafe, a multi-cuisine cloud kitchen, at the gated community they live in. At Mantri Synergy in Padur, these two families reside at the same block, and are only a floor apart. Freya Wilson, a graphic designer by profession who teaches the subject at a college, lives on the same floor as Anuradha, and she was roped in to carry out the design and artwork for Tumbo. “The space where Tumbo is located has so far been let out only for residents, for a nominal rent, to run a cafe for the benefit of the community,” discloses Anuradha. Around the time this space fell vacant, the four could see the debilitating effects of kitchen fatigue all around them. They even had a front-row view of it, having watched members of their own family battling it. Anuradha says she noticed that many of her neighbours were fed up to their finger tips putting on the apron and cooking three meals a day, and they desperately wanted a break, and order at least one meal. “During the intense lockdown, many senior citizens were cooking for themselves, and they found it a dreary business,” says Anuradha. “My father- and mother-in-law, both in their eighties, live alone, on the same floor as my sister Deepa. My mother-in-law would insist that her family would eat only the food made at home, cooked by her, but she was struggling through the cooking. Now, she has started ordering food once in a while.” Anuradha believes there is a distinct advantage to both serving people in your own community, and being served by them. From the foodpreneurs’ point of view, they know many of their customers at a personal level, and which could mean they are in a position to customise the takeouts, without being reminded how to. “There is someone we know who has a kidney ailment, and we know what food he is looking for. So, the same meals will come with less salt and oil for him,” says Anuradha. From the customers’ point of view, it is always reassuring to know that there is nothing set even about a set menu. “We have introduced set menus, but there is nothing cut and dried about it, and we would rework the combo anytime. So, if someone wants just one roti instead of the three that a pre-set menu may specify, we would be naturally inclined to relax the rule. Often, to the greatest extent possible. We cannot lose sight of the fact that we are on a transaction with neighbours.” When you are running a food business in your community, especially among neighbours you know very well, expect impromptu addas. Though Tumbo is a cloud kitchen, it sometimes becomes a space for an “adda”, notes Anuradha. “We offer a full pot of chai in the morning and evening. When we do so, sometimes, before we know it, an adda-like thing would be going on under our nose.” The four also know that in its core, this is an enterprise that has to succeed to justify its existence. So, the line of control are the workflow are clearly defined. Deepa and Saurav are engaged in the day-to-day functioning of the cloud kitchen. Rahul takes care of the part involving the procurement of essential items required daily in the kitchen. Anuradha handles the communications and social media aspects of the enterprise, and is assisted in this work by Freya. The challenge in continuing with household help caused by the pandemic has naturally increased the demand for takeouts. Anuradha says, “There is always going to be a section of the community that would look for outside food.”  During the intense lockdown, many senior citizens were cooking for themselves, and they found it a dreary business||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/when-your-neighbours-become-foodpreneurs/article32939373.ece

The vehicular traffic on this lane flows towards St. Thomas Mount. It does not help matters that this service lane is located near the Porur junction, which often bustles with movement of vehicles, including Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses. With a few hospitals located in the vicinity, ambulances also frequent the junction. Further, an almost continuous stream of pedestrians would be crossing the intersection. Yet, the service lane is not well-maintained, residents point out. The lane comes under the purview of the State Highways Department. In comparison to the service lanes of other flyovers which were also opened a few years ago — such as the ones at Vadapalani, Vyasarpadi and Moolakadai — the service lane of the Porur flyover has not been maintained well. “When it rains, it is difficult to use the lane because it gets inundated. The stretch has to be completely relaid,” says K. Venkatesh, a resident of Porur. The residents have also raised the issue of unauthorised parking of vehicles on both sides of the service lane. It is three years since the flyover came up. However, residents say, the Porur intersection continues to be congested and pedestrians find it unsafe to cross it. “Parking of vehicles should be strictly restricted,” adds Venkatesh. In this respect, a State Highways official says, “Steps will be taken to have the lane relaid at the earliest.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/motorists-do-not-have-it-easy-at-service-lane-in-porur/article32939362.ece

Nothing fanciful about this café, but S. Saravanan promises to delight you with freshly-brewed coffee and his story of hope and resilience. Saravanan was heading South India operations of a major brand until lockdown forced the organisation to close down certain divisions. With his 18 years of corporate experience, Saravanan got ready to start his own business. “The idea of venturing into the food business was always there in my mind but I was not confident of taking the plunge; the lockdown was an opportunity for me to give it a shot,” says Saravanan. His biggest advantage was finding a space to run the café from the comfort of his apartment, Kochar Panchsheel, where he is a resident for the last three years. A 100 sq. ft. space belonging to the apartment association was being used as space to keep waste before it was disposed of. “It is outside the gated community but belongs to the Association so that came as an advantage as we could draw people from inside the community as well as outside,” says Saravanan. The Association was happy to rent it out at a fee as the room was used to dump the garbage collected from every household. After solid waste management was introduced in the society, we were less dependent on this room. “Getting the Association’s consent to use this space came as a timely help. Next, I got the space refurbished and spent close to Rs. 3.5 lakh replacing its tiles, undertaking patchwork on the walls and carrying out other works,” he says. Running the outlet, however, was not a cake walk for this sales executive. Srivari Café opened in August by selling coffee and tea but it was running at a loss for close to a month. So, he added tiffin varieties to the menu but as Saravanan was outsourcing the production there were many challenges along the way. “I hired a person who was without work as the school canteen he was working at was not operating. Things did not go as expected that I even thought if I should give up on this initiative,” he says. The pricing of items seemed to contribute to the poor sales. “I was selling a plate of two idli at Rs. 20 and that was a bit high for auto rickshaw drives and others looking for a quick bite, so I had to rework the rate chart,” he says, adding that he did not compromise on the quality of food. After a short lull, Saravanan hired a new cook. “Serving breakfast as well as coffee/tea has started drawing customers, both from the society and outside,” he says. Many are repeat customers and that includes floating in and out of the locality and those employed at the companies on the stretch. Saravanan is happy with the little progress he is making in the business. Ask him if he plans to return to the corporate world once the economy bounces back, Saravanan says, the satisfaction that he has got in the last couple of months is more than want he earned in the last 18 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/how-a-garbage-storeroom-morphed-into-an-eatery/article32939374.ece

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||In the deep end||With every lap he takes in a pool in Dubai, Srihari Nataraj becomes increasingly aware that he has to wake Indian swimming from its deep slumber. The 19-year-old from Bengaluru owns all three national records in backstroke and is currently the country’s brightest prospect in the sport. But India is a fledgling in world swimming: no Indian has ever made the ‘A’ qualification standard, which offers a confirmed berth for the Olympics. Those who made it to the Games earlier took the very unpredictable ‘B’ qualification route or went through the universality quota offered by the world body FINA to countries where no swimmer has made the qualification cut. India has won just one gold in the Asian Games, which was bagged by Sachin Nag in the 100m freestyle at the inaugural edition in New Delhi in 195. Even bronze medals at the Asian Games are rare: two came from the last eight editions, the latest being Sandeep Sejwal’s bronze in the 2014 Asiad in Incheon, South Korea. So why is swimming doing so poorly in India? Far ahead “You can say it’s bad luck. At the Asian Games, we have China and Japan that are among the top four in the men’s section in the Olympics, and among the top five or six in the women’s section. And in most events, they figure in the finals at the Olympics,” says Wilson Cherian, once the country’s finest backstroke swimmer, who finished fourth in the 1982 Asian Games in New Delhi. “They are very good. When we compete against them at the Asiad, we only finish fifth or sixth,” he says. “And many countries, like Singapore and Korea, send their swimmers to the U.S. for training. Unlike India, swimming gets good support in these countries.” The Commonwealth Games are tougher still. “In sports such as table tennis and badminton, getting a Commonwealth Games gold is easy. It is tough for Indian swimmers to win the Asiad gold because of the presence of countries like China, Japan and Korea; and in the Commonwealth Games, where we have Australia, England and South Africa, we don’t stand a chance,” says Cherian. Indians are some 20 years behind the world’s best in the sport, says the Chennai-based former ace. “We are just reaching the 1990s standard when it comes to strokes and techniques. We are so far behind; even when we do the somersault for the turn, the gap is clearly apparent,” he says. “If you look at the 100m backstroke, the world champion [Xu Jiayu] is Chinese. The Japanese are also far ahead. Their strokes are very good, their technique much superior to us. They are just about the size of Indian swimmers but in technique, they are way ahead. They use technology to their advantage, their coaches are good and they also have foreign experts training them.”  Stark contrast Athletics and swimming are the two major disciplines in any multi-event games. The 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta spotlighted the stark difference between the two. While athletics got India its best-ever haul of 20 medals, including eight gold, swimming had nothing to show for itself in Jakarta. Swimming also happens to be among the last sports to have opened for training after the lockdown. Six months after they were sent out, swimmers returned to the pool only on October 15. India sent three elite swimmers — Nataraj, Kushagra Rawat and Sajan Prakash — to Dubai towards the end of August for a two-month training camp organised by the Swimming Federation of India (SFI). “The feel of the water was very weird the first day, my arms managed okay but my legs felt different. It took a while to get the feel back,” says Nataraj on a call from Dubai. The country stands to gain immensely from the youngster’s progress. And Cherian feels Nataraj could be the game-changer that Indian swimming is desperately looking for. “In my opinion, he is the only world-class swimmer in the country. If he focuses hard, he can create history, perhaps even become the first Indian swimmer to reach the final at the Olympics,” says Cherian.  “He is very talented and is almost 6’4”. And he has got strong legs. His strokes have a good reach and he is just 19. I feel he can make the Olympic ‘A’ qualification standard next year. If he works hard, he is capable of entering the Olympic final.”  Great expectations Nataraj, who has achieved the Olympic ‘B’ qualification standard in the 100m back with his personal best of 54.69s, is confident of making the ‘A’ cut (53.85s). “I know I can make the ‘A’ qualification, and I’m looking at much faster timings, something that will guarantee me an Asian Games medal... something like 52s [in the 100m backstroke],” says Nataraj, who came seventh in the 100m backstroke and sixth in the 50m at the Junior Worlds in Budapest last year. Can he meet his exceptional goals? “I usually have very high expectations of myself, soon I’ll meet them,” says the youth, who is coached by A.C. Jayarajan. Excelling at the highest level is all about the mind. “I wasn’t the fastest at Budapest (last year’s Junior Worlds). When I knew there are people who are faster than me, I knew I had to do something different,” says Nataraj. “It’s all in the mind and I knew I had it in me.” Nataraj believes that a few good performances at the world level could transform the sport in the country. And those don’t seem too far away. “We do have some good talent, we have quite a few swimmers with a lot of potential,” says Nataraj, who spent the lockdown days attending clinics and reading to understand the science of his sport better. “If everything goes well, we have a shot at multiple medals at the 2022 Asian Games. I don’t see why we can’t race them [the Chinese and the Japanese]. The smartest swimmer will always have an edge over a swimmer who is strong. Gold should be possible unless Xu Jiayu [the 100m backstroke world champion and Olympic silver medallist] drops one second and breaks the world record.” Only time will tell if Nataraj will reach his goal, but Indian swimming can certainly do with such confidence. Distance specialist Advait Page, one of the six from the country to make the ‘B’ standard for next year’s Olympics, also believes that the long wait to make the ‘A’ cut could end in the next few months. “After a long time, India can see swimmers making the ‘A’ cut. It may be the young or the experienced. Difficult to say when and how many, but before the Olympics in 2021, I’m optimistic about the elusive ‘A’ cut,” says Page, who now trains at the University of Florida, U.S., where he has some of the world’s best swimmers to inspire him. “When that happens, more young swimmers who are training hard will get motivated,” he says. Months behind Monal Chokshi, the Secretary General of SFI, also feels that India could have two ‘A’ qualifiers for Tokyo. “Currently, [freestyle sprinter] Virdhawal Khade and Srihari are very close to ‘A’. But, honestly, it’s very difficult to say because swimmers who have made the ‘B’ cut were also out of training for about six months. For them to come back to form and then convert their ‘B’ to ‘A’ is not an easy task,” he says. “And we are two to three months behind other top countries in terms of resuming training. It is a setback, but we have time to make the cut.” Three distance swimmers — Rawat, Page, Aryan Makhija and butterfly star Prakash — besides Khade and Nataraj, have made the ‘B’ qualification standard. “Kushagra Rawat (400, 800 and 1,500m) is the only swimmer with three ‘B’ cuts. But the ‘A’ qualification time for Kushagra and Advait in two events (800 and 1,500m) looks tough especially considering they have not been training for six months; the distance events require a lot of endurance capacity,” explains Chokshi. “The 100m backstroke is more like a sprint event. And I would say, as a federation, we would not like to jump the gun. Our best wishes are with all the boys.” Despite the many setbacks, Indian swimming at the top level appears now to have a youthful and promising look about it. “If you look at last year’s under-18 world rankings, we had five boys in the top 100. These five have a long way to go and if they are good and if they continue to stay in competition for the next eight to 10 years, the future is very bright. Because, in swimming, the peak performance age at the world level is between 24 and 26 years,” said the SFI Secretary. What is important is how they train going forward, over these two Olympic cycles, says Choksi. As for the women, they have not yet made a major contribution at the world level; even the Olympic ‘B’ qualifiers are only boys right now, says Choksi. “But we have some very good swimmers in the girls category, also in the under-18 group, including Ridhima V. Kumar, Apeksha Fernandes, Shivangi Sarma and Bhavya Sachdeva — so we are hopeful. What will be important is how we are going to work with them in the next four to eight years.” There is one missing ingredient in the sport, says Choksi, which is perhaps why the swimmers lag behind their counterparts other Asian countries. “It is not about what has been stopping them actually because our swimmers have been consistently getting faster. What has been missing is a sports science element in their training,” he says. “We have good coaches in India, but we need to systematically leverage sports science. We must also give them much more international exposure.” Moving forward, that is an area the SFI will be looking at, bringing in world-class sports science support for the top athletes. Our swimmers deserve all this and more.  Indians are some 20 years behind the world’s best in the sport, says Wilson Cherian, the Chennai-based former ace. “We are just reaching the 1990s standard when it comes to strokes and techniques.”   Nataraj believes that a few good performances at the world level could transform the sport in the country.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Designing India||The image of Bhanu Athaiya calmly walking up to receive the Oscar in a silver-studded blue chiffon sari with her white handbag clutched firmly under her arm is as iconic as the Ram Dhun the orchestra played to celebrate her win. Sir Richard Attenborough says it took him exactly 15 minutes to know that Athaiya was the right person to create the costumes for Gandhi . Athaiya, who died aged 91 on October 15, wasn’t a woman given to talking about herself, or her incredible research into provincial and ancient costumes of India, or her relationships with a plethora of directors and stars over a 60-year career and 125-odd movies. Even her 2010 memoir, The Art of Costume Design , contained only 11 sketches and limited personal information. That’s why it’s both educational and disquieting to see that over 100 articles from Athaiya’s estate are coming up for auction between October 2020 and April 2021. These will not include her Oscar or her Gandhi memorabilia that she returned to the Academy for safekeeping in 2012. The first lot currently on view includes her artworks and handwritten notes from the time she was the only woman in the Progressive Artists’ Group (PAG), as well as information about her family and early life. These alone make her story worthy of a museum collection. Father’s legacy Athaiya’s handwritten notes mention that her father, Ganpatrao ‘Annasaheb’ Rajopadhye, was a rich, self-taught artist from Kolhapur. He encouraged his wife and six daughters to study and even hired an art tutor for Athaiya when she was eight. He served as an associate director on the Telugu film Harischandra (1935) and ventured into independent direction and production a few years later. He died in September 1940 while his film Mohini (1940, Marathi) was still under production, but it introduced the 10-year-old Athaiya to films; she played the role of the king’s son in it. Athaiya started working as a part-time illustrator for a woman’s weekly called Fashion and Beauty . Her greatest moment of pride was painting Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba for the Independence Day issue of August 15, 1947. By 1948, she was winning prizes and her teacher recommended her for a scholarship at the J.J. School of Art in Mumbai — the hub of the European style of painting in India. Simultaneously, she landed a part-time job as fashion illustrator for the newly launched Eve’s Weekly . She also designed for the magazine’s boutique, where film stars like Nargis and Kamini Kaushal shopped. Nargis introduced her to Raj Kapoor, who asked her to design Nadira’s clothes in Shri 420 (1955), which created a fashion sensation. At J.J. School, V.S. Gaitonde was her teacher and her influence can be seen in his work of this time. He also did a painting of her called Portrait of Bhanu (1952). In her graduating year, she won both a gold medal and a fellowship to study mural painting. Invited to be a part of the PAG exhibition in 1953, she contributed two paintings, Prayers and Banana Sellers. This was an exciting time. “I, along with other upcoming artists such as M.F. Husain, Kishen Khanna, Raza, Ara, Souza, Gade, and others would meet and hear talks and accounts of the changing scene in art from other parts of the world,” writes Athaiya. The pull of cinema The PAG officially broke up in 1954, but Athaiya had chosen cinema by then. “The pull to be involved in cinema was far stronger and I finally gave in to it,” she writes. She worked in C.I.D . (1956), followed by Pyaasa (1957), Chaudhvin Ka Chand (1960) and Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam (1962). In 1966, she did Teesri Manzil , Mera Saaya and Amrapali , and got a scholarship to study fashion design in France for six months. “Paris opened up the world for me. I travelled to Spain to absorb the art of Goya and the colours and sights of the gondolas! Another weekend saw me taking in the art and cultural heritage of Rome!! As students, we were given a lot of opportunities to visit fashion houses and see the big names in the couture world at work,” she writes.  Gandhi (1982), of course, was the film that introduced her to the world. She designed all the Indian outfits for the huge cast, including the 3,00,000 extras in the funeral scene. “In my mind, I had told myself that I had done my best, that I had done justice to Gandhiji’s name and the freedom movement,” she writes. She continued to be the most iconic costume designer in Indian cinema, designing ensembles that ranged from Simi Garewal’s breathtaking costumes in Siddhartha (1972) and Sridevi’s chiffon sarees in Chandni (1989) to Dimple Kapadia’s evocative Rajasthani ensembles in Lekin (1991) and the huge canvas of Indian and British costumes for Lagaan (2001). Her last film was the Marathi thriller Nagrik (2015). That Athaiya was clearly aware of the importance of her work in formulating history through her art, design and historical research is evident from her meticulously kept notes. She stood toe to toe with the greatest artists, directors and illustrators and defined post-Independence India, both through her research on regional and ancient costumes and her ability to create contemporary glamour and fashion. “I had an understanding of culture,” she once said to a film critic. It will be interesting to see if her designs and notes now find a home where they can be enjoyed by the public as her costumes were, or if they disappear into a vault somewhere.  The writer is the author of a fantasy series, and specialises in art and culture of South East Asia.  It is both educational and a bit disquieting to see that over 100 articles from Athaiya’s estate are coming up for auction between October 2020 and April 2021||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/designing-india/article32939388.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||The brightest star||One story that writer and singer Sheila Dhar told but did not write was about smoking on the sly. She was a young medical student then, before switching to English literature, and had just discovered the stolen joys of cigarettes. She smoked at college and thought rinsing out her mouth before her music classes insured her against being found out, but she was mistaken. One day after a somewhat dispiriting session, her music teacher dismissed her saying, “ Bibi, ya toh gaana gayo, ya sutta maaro .” [“Young lady, you can either sing or light a fag.”] Helpless guffaws shook her as she imitated his tone, relishing the coarseness of the teacher’s phrasing. She was speaking to a three-person audience: Rukun Advani and I had begun as her editors and become her friends; and Partho Datta was by then one of her closest musical friends. He is now a professor of Arts and Aesthetics at JNU, and scholarly rummagings through musical archives are part of a day’s work for him. Yesterday, he unearthed and sent across a treasure: a rare recording of a live performance, complete with crackling, occasional distortions, applause. Mrs. Dhar’s recorded performances are few and scattered. Set beside her acute, brilliantly comic writing, the deeply meditative, interiorised quality of her singing is scarcely believable. This is not a performer telling stories with a merry twinkle and watching for the effect of her words on her audience; it is someone singing as a way of communing with the deepest reaches of her own being. It is as if the voice that sings and the one that speaks come from two different people. Echoes of the singing voice can be found in the early part of her book Raga’ n Josh , especially in the moving chapter on her mother, titled ‘Baua’, which reflects the introspective, sometimes deeply melancholic moods that overcame her. Her book is a memoir of a kind but it is not about herself. She writes of the gifts, struggles, comicality and joy of those who surround her: at times, family and friends, but centrally, musicians. When she does write about her own music, it is with a dismissive air, as if she were a comic misfit, a magpie among nightingales. Someone asked me the other day why I had written in an article that working in the world of books was the best kind of work. One of the reasons is Mrs. Dhar, whom I would never have known but for my job. When I met her, I was a junior editor ordered to put her first book into paperback. She sailed into my room unexpectedly one afternoon to inspect me, infuriated at being thus relegated — few authors like a change of editors, especially if they are rolled downhill, from senior to junior. That first meeting went badly; she left with looks of withering exasperation. But she returned a fortnight later. She sank into a chair and dabbed at one of her eyes. It was half-closed, twitching, probably with an injury. What’s so funny? I felt a tide of unseemly giggles rise inside me. It must have been from panic at having to meet her again and the more I tried to clamp down on it, the worse it got. “What’s so funny?” she said in an ominous tone. She was large, tall, imperious, a woman who would have inspired fear and awe if she were the head of a university or a government. In the way people dig deeper graves in desperation, I managed to gasp, “You look like Lalita Pawar.” I was thinking of the actor from the 1960s who was known for her winking eye, a tic that was endlessly deployed in Hindi movies to comic effect. Having uttered the actor’s name, I knew it was all over for me. Mentally, I began emptying my recently acquired desk. After a moment’s stunned silence, Mrs. Dhar started to twinkle and the open, guffawing laughter I came to know well began bubbling out of her. I think this merriment about herself is what made her dismissive of her own singing. Similarly, she refused to believe that her stories were worth telling. They were coaxed out of her with great patience by the publisher Esha Béteille, then a senior editor at Oxford University Press. Mrs. Dhar’s next book, The Cooking of Music , was published by Permanent Black, and frequent editorial meetings were deemed essential by her and by us. We would get to work at mid-morning and by afternoon, distracting scents of mutton pasanda and fried lotus stem would waft across from the kitchen; after a huge lunch that left us comatose, there would be late afternoon tea with mung dal halwa from Ghantewala in Old Delhi. Before each such meeting, she would phone Partho Datta and plan the menu, especially the carnivorous part of it. Culinary planning “What should I cook for Anuradha, poor thing, a Bengali married to a vegetarian.” “Why bother so much?” Partho would reply, pulling her leg. She would say only half-joking, “ Arre, kya kehte ho, beti ghar aa rahi hai .” [“Don’t say that. It’s my daughter coming home.”] Mrs. Dhar died in 2001 of lung complications at 72. Right at the end, no visitors were allowed near her because she was vulnerable to infection. My last sight of her was from outside the door of her room, across many metres, masked. This seems an average daily cruelty now, but it was unnerving and heartbreaking then. She would have liked this story, narrated by the Icelandic writer Andri Snær Magnason about his friend, the scientist Gudmunder Páll Ólafsson: ‘We were convinced that if he came back he would come as a bird, not as a majestic eagle or a great northern diver, but a misunderstood bird like a starling. Gudmunder Páll always took the side of misunderstood animals. Two days before his funeral, I opened the door to my office and heard a strange whistling of wings and a chirping. A little starling had somehow come in and was beating its wings frantically against the window. I could hardly believe my own eyes. I carefully caught the bird, held it gently in my grasp, and my eyes filled with tears. I opened the window, released the bird and watched him fly out into the late summer sun.’ ( On Time and Water , 2020) The writer is the author of several novels, includingAll the Lives We Never Lived.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||The other India||I have lived through the #TanishqAd... my Muslim mother-in-law gifted me a mangalsutra and even godhbharai .” Architect Rachna Lanewala, who tweeted this at the height of the Tanishq ad controversy last fortnight, is not the only woman to have “lived through” the experience depicted in the jewellery advertisement. Almost half a century ago, writer Saryu Rizvi’s parents would accompany each other to their respective shrines, be it the temple to get their new car blessed, or to the Karbala Maidan during Muharram. There has always existed a world in India beyond the imagination of fanatics, where religion is not one’s primary identity, and a Hindu can marry a Muslim without either of them changing their faith. So, while in 1972, Saryu’s parents, hailing from Kanpur and Dehradun, could only consider getting married in Delhi, the question of conversion never came up. Fully supportive Neither did it come up in 1999 when Aasif Lanewala married his collegemate Rachna, whose parents, having migrated to Delhi after Partition, had warned her never to marry a Muslim. More than a thousand attended their Mumbai reception. In 2012, journalist Mustafa Plumber, ignoring murmurs from the men in his family, declared that he wasn’t planning to convert his colleague Prachi Pinglay when they got married. At his younger brother’s nikaah , it was Prachi, guided by Mustafa’s mother, who performed the rituals expected of the eldest bahu (daughter-in-law). The timeline from Saryu’s parents, who didn’t inform their families about their civil marriage right away, to Mustafa and Prachi, whose wedding was attended by both families, has not been a linear one. Religious conversions happen even today, but far often than not, it is more a formality to please the families and not some “jihadi trap” as portrayed by the radical fringe. Thus Veena’s (name changed) conversion only meant a change in her official name. Straight after her wedding, her husband accompanied her to Tirupati for a long-desired pilgrimage.  Elopements too continue to take place in this world. In 1996, Vidya and Shoaib (names changed) fled to Vadodara after a secret wedding at the Registrar’s. Both belonged to joint families that had their own businesses. To their surprise, Shoaib’s parents called them back and hosted a grand dinner after a nikaah (marriage ceremony). Vidya’s uncle too, who had objected the most, became fully supportive. Though Shoaib, despite having grown up in a Muslim locality, happily participated in Diwali pujas with his Marwari in-laws, Vidya took her new religion seriously — until she got drawn to meditation two years ago. Nobody had forced her to do namaaz and nobody objected when she stopped. Secular upbringing Contrary to popular belief, these Hindu-Muslim marriages are not restricted to the well-to-do. Masood Akhtar, who till recently lived in a slum, still wakes up to nightmares of the time he was beaten up by the police and put behind bars during the 1992-93 Mumbai riots. But he refused to let the trauma tarnish the secular upbringing he had had. As a boy, he would often accompany his father to his workshop to distribute Diwali sweets to his Hindu workers. When Masood informed his family that his Hindu fiancee’s name must remain unchanged after the nikaah , only his father supported him. Today, his joint family consults his wife Rama Shyam on everything. And every Durga Puja, Masood, Rama and their son go pandal-hopping. The best part of this world is not the conservatives it manages to convert along the way, but the children born of such unions. Saryu fondly recalls her mother reading the Ramayana while the local maulana who had come to meet her waited patiently. “ Accha, baaji paath padh rahi hai (Let sister finish reciting the Ramayana ),” he would say. Her father named her after the U.P. river sacred to Hindus. Aasif still regrets not being allowed to say ‘Indian’ in the religion column of his son’s birth certificate. When the child was four, he was asked by someone in Aasif’s hometown Dahod whether he was Hindu or Muslim. The cricket-crazy boy simply said, “I’m a Mumbai Indian”. Mustafa finds that his two-year-old son has taken over what used to be his task on Diwali day — ringing the bell while Prachi performs Lakshmi puja. Sometimes, the toddler stands next to him when Mustafa performs the namaaz . “Let him find his own path,” say the parents. Going forward, it is these children who will prove to be immune to the vitriol spewed by bigots. The writer is a Mumbai-based freelance journalist.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Poirot at 100||July 28, 1914. The First World War has broken out. Germany invades Belgium and turns millions homeless. Evicted from their homeland, Belgians seek asylum in England. A bus full of Belgian refugees reaches Torquay in 1915. Among these shell-shocked refugees is a man named Jacques Hornais. With his diminutive figure, eccentric gait, egg-shaped bald pate and extravagant moustache, he turns heads around the terminus. It transpires he is a police officer, recently retired. In a Torquay town hall, meanwhile, a young woman named Agatha Miller (she would later marry Archibald Christie, a military officer) is working as nurse and dispensing chemist. Soon, at a fund-raising programme held for war emigrants, Agatha, performing as a solo pianist, spots Hornais. And when she starts writing crime novels in 1916, she instinctively homes in on the man she would now cast as her detective. She says in her autobiography, “I settled on the Belgian detective. I allowed him slowly to grow into his part. He should have been an inspector, so that he would have a certain knowledge of crime. He would be meticulous, very tidy... And he should be brainy — he should have little grey cells of the mind... Yes, he would have little grey cells.” Stickler for order Disregarding the influence of Sherlock Holmes, Arsène Lupin and Joseph Rouletabille, Agatha formed a unique detective. He would be a stickler for order and method and follow the prompts of his little grey cells rather than analyse footprints or cigar ash. Growing up a loner and subsequently working with wounded soldiers, Agatha had developed a set of incisive eyes. And shaping her protagonist, she spontaneously came up with someone who would solve crimes with astute observation and knowledge of human psychology. While naming the sleuth, Agatha fancied Hercules, the mythical Greek hero, an embodiment of brawn and brain. But, perhaps in deference to her detective’s 5’4” height, she decided to remove the ‘s’. She arrived at the famous surname by merging the names of two fictional detectives — Hercule Popeau and Monsieur Jules Poiret. A hundred years have passed since the creation of Hercule Poirot. The Mysterious Affairs at Styles was published by John Lane in the U.S. in October 1920 and in the U.K. by The Bodley Head (John Lane’s UK branch) in January 1921. A runway success, it’s odd to think now that the manuscript was rejected many times before. The “dear little man” subsequently appeared in numerous crime novels and short stories, and three plays by Christie, conquering hearts the world over. His popularity continues even today: for most readers, solving crime with the diminutive, dapper detective is like taking part in a feast of suspense. The more we dig in, the more we get addicted.  Mysterious Affairs got praise from high quarters. The Pharmaceutical Journal wrote: “This detective story has dealt with poisons in a knowledgeable way, and not with the nonsense about untraceable substances that so often happens. Agatha Christie knows her job.” Christie’s days as apothecary’s assistant had paid off. I am the best Poirot’s primary attraction was his way of detection, which was quite unlike any followed by his peers in the genre until then. The detective got into the mind not only of the murderer but also the victim to solve the crimes. Christie was as much psychologist as writer. Some of Poirot’s observations speak of her intimate knowledge of the human mind, such as when he says, “She might have trusted you. But Mademoiselle Katherine has spent a great deal of her life listening, and those who have listened do not find it easy to talk; they keep their sorrows and joys to themselves and tell no one” ( The Mystery of the Blue Train ). But creators often come to hate what they have made. As Poirot’s popularity kept soaring, Christie began to find him insufferable, calling him a “detestable, bombastic, tiresome, egocentric little creep”. She would eventually kill him off in Curtain: Poirot’s Last Case . What made her so uneasy about the character she had created novel by novel, tale by tale, play by play? Did she feel bested by her own detective? One is not quite sure. We do know that Poirot himself would have had no doubts about it. We are always left with an image of the little man doffing his hat: “‘Rest assured,’ said Hercule Poirot. ‘I am the best!”’ The writer is a Kolkata-based freelancer and documentary filmmaker.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Sex, lies and Zoom calls||One receives with no little dismay the news that an American gentleman by the name of Jeffrey Toobin has been suspended by The New Yorker magazine because he was seen masturbating on a Zoom work call. By all reports, Mr. Toobin is a serious man, a staffer of the prestigious New Yorker for 25 years and attached to CNN as a legal analyst, and one can’t help feeling that if this can happen to someone like him it could perhaps happen, if not to anyone, then certainly to a lot more people than one imagines. Not that one wants to imagine what one might call a Zoom-onanist in overly terrific detail. The camera is watching This incident follows an earlier one in which, during a Zoom city council meeting in Rio de Janeiro, one of the participants was overcome with the need to enjoy carnal exchange with his partner. The gent forgot (or failed) to turn off his camera and the other participants could see the frenetic activity in the far background of the frame. This being Brazil, a country more mature than others in these matters, the council chair continued the meeting while technicians were asked to cut off the feed from the erring member’s video and audio. “I don’t believe a Zoom call is over until I hit LEAVE, quit my browser, shut down, close the laptop lid, stick my computer in a drawer and leave the room,” tweeted noted American art critic, Jerry Saltz. Given the various incidents of ‘backstage’ moments leaking into live conference mosaics it’s hard to label Mr. Saltz’s statement as paranoia; ‘due diligence’ might be a far more accurate tag for what he describes. Among all the different compressions the pandemic is bringing to our lives — such as the melding of office and home space, the disintegration of the notion of working hours, the challenge to assumptions and needs for physical proximity previously taken for granted — the further mutation of the role the camera plays in our lives is a crucial one. The Toobin case, for example, lights up a lot of intersecting issues simultaneously. Forbidden pleasures Firstly, there are the much-discussed erotics of the computer screen that delivers digital slices from the rest of the world into your most private zone, your mind. The frisson of this might come from the feeling of controlling what the screen does and how it behaves, even as the Internet accidentally trips you into various rabbit holes of surprise and discovery. On the flip side, there is the sizzle created by the reverse frame, that is, not what you can see via the computer but what the computer can see of you, specifically what the frame of the computer camera reveals of you and what it hides from the other(s), the above and below of it, the off-stage right and left of it. Group video apps were already proliferating when they were given a turbo boost by Covid. Already we’ve had jokes about executives all dressed up for formal online meetings, suited but not booted, with all sorts of business going on below the deskline, so to speak, whether someone is in their track pants, pyjamas, briefs or whatever. This schizo-dressing could begin from practical need or sheer laziness. But from the thrill provided by this, it’s but a short path to the age-old impulse of wanting to engage in sexual activity at times and in places where such activity is forbidden, to plunge into the whirl of pleasure proscribed by the context, often where the risk of being discovered and of ensuing repercussions is high. Watching porn and using it to engage in atmanirbharta was one of the earliest uses of Internet video. Virtual sex by consenting parties is also now old hat. The proliferation of handheld devices has made porn and virtual sexual exchange even more ubiquitous. However, in these jaded times further sandpapered by Covid, all sorts of other stuff could bring an individual to libidinal satisfaction. Mr. Toobin, for example, was participating in a kind of election ‘war game’ conducted by his magazine, where people were playing the roles of Trump, Biden, the Supreme Court, the military. Perhaps it’s a gross assumption to think he was fantasising about local activity while, presumably, thinking globally. In these post-truth times, all sorts of things can excite people: quasi-news, fictional news, or data and information, false or true. The floating trigger of the screen can and probably does set off almost uncontrollable thrills in some people, whether it’s from Donald Trump’s (alleged) recovery from (alleged) Covid, or claims of daring fighter-bomber raids into a neighbouring country’s territory, or watching the sleaze fest of ‘Doorknob’ Goswami working to destroy the reputations of unsuspecting people.  On the flip side, there is the sizzle created by the reverse frame, that is, not what you can see via the computer but what the computer can see of you||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/sex-lies-and-zoom-calls/article32939455.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||India’s cultural inheritance||India’s relationship with Ram has become very complex. Lord Ram is a widely revered Hindu deity. In the realm of mass culture, as Jawaharlal Nehru himself noted in his Discovery of India , the influence of the Ramayana and Mahabharata has remained unparalleled. Furthermore, as a result of the long process of syncretism and Indianisation of Islam, many Muslims also respect Ram. For example, Abdur Rahim Khan-e-Khana, known as the ‘bhakti’ poet Rahim (1556-1627), who was one of Akbar’s ‘navaratnas’, wrote thus in praise of Ram: “ Gahi sarnagati Ram ki, bhavsagar ki naav / Rahiman jagat udhar ko, aur na kachhu upaiy” ( The only way to achieve salvation is through unconditional surrender to Ram). Ominous trend Yet, in recent times, Ram has been controversialised by two intellectual and political trends. A section of educated Hindus, influenced by atheistic Marxism, have a negative opinion about the Ramayana and many other patrimonies of Hinduism. Their propagation of secularism in anti-Hindu terms has now received a strong pushback from India’s majority community. On a convergent track, much of the Dalit movement inspired by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar (in particular, by his book Riddle of Rama and Krishna ) is fiercely critical of the two Hindu epics and their main characters. A far more consequential and ominous development has been the Ram Janmabhoomi movement launched by the RSS-led Hindutva Parivar. By politicising, communalising and, indeed, weaponising Ram, it has divided Indian society in a bid to consolidate a Hindu vote bank big enough for the BJP to remain in power indefinitely. It aims to use its political power to establish a Hindu supremacist nation that marginalises non-Hindus. It is in this context that we should view the enormous usefulness of Pavan Varma’s new contribution to the Ramayana literature in English — The Greatest Ode to Lord Ram: Tulsidas’s Ramcharitmanas . An eminent scholar, diplomat and politician, Varma has authored a book that challenges the anti-Hindu critics of Ram as well as the anti-Muslim Hindu right. Mahatma Gandhi, the greatest and truest Ram bhakt in modern India, regarded Ramcharitmanas by Sant Tulsidas (1532-1623) “as the greatest book in all devotional literature”. He said, “My Ram, the Ram of our prayers, is not the historical Ram, the King of Ayodhya. He is the eternal, the unborn, the one without a second. Call him Ishwara, Allah, God, Ahura Mazda. His names are innumerable. He is timeless, formless, stainless. Him alone I worship.” The Ram that emerges from Tulsi’s classic is no different. His Ramayana is not an embellished mythological story; it is a profound elucidation of the spiritual, philosophical and ethical teachings that have in many ways defined our civilisation. Four pillars The most instructive chapter in the book, also the longest, is about the meaning of Ramrajya. “Was Tulsi’s vision of Ramrajya secular?” Varma poses this question, and answers it affirmatively. “In Tulsi’s definition of Ramrajya, righteousness prevails, supported by the four pillars of truth, purity, compassion and charity,” which, we must note, are also the pillars of every religion. Ramrajya is “a kingdom in which there is no violence, there are equal rights for everyone... and all people are bound by mutual love — sab nara karahin paraspar priti ”. Tulsi’s Ramrajya may sound utopian. It may even seem imperfect from some modern perspectives. Nevertheless, it is largely free from the taint of injustice. Such a kingdom would not be “an exclusively Hindu State”, Varma avers. “It would work to create a harmonious society, respecting people of all faiths.” The book’s virtues, however, go far beyond contemporary controversies. One of the greatest strengths of Ramcharitmanas (which means ‘the splendid lake of Ram’s character’) is that it illuminates “the philosophical intricacies of Hinduism” in “a lyrical outpouring”. Like all the great Bhakti poet-saints born in different parts of India, Tulsi synthesises the apparent “dichotomy between a ‘nirguna’ (attributeless Absolute) and ‘saguna’ (attribute-full) deity”. He harmonises another important dichotomy — the diversity of castes and social groups. Tulsi also “overarches the schism between the Shivaite and Vaishnavite schools, and projects a harmony where Hinduism is seen as a holistic unity.” People outside north India cannot perhaps imagine the profound impact of Ramcharitmanas on common people. Tulsidas, who lived his early life in Ayodhya and died in Kashi, achieved this feat due mainly to three factors. First, the masses were influenced by his message of bhakti or absolute devotion as the path to reach the lord, as against the ‘jnana marg’, the path of knowledge. Second, he is unsparing in rebuking human follies, but does so in a way that is gentle and educative, not retributive. Third, and most important, his poetry in Awadhi (not in Sanskrit) is animated by a unique combination of beauty, simplicity and divinity, because of which it is chanted even today, both in individual prayers and mass devotional assemblies. When an epic is thus treasured in the hearts, minds and on the lips of the multitudes, century after century, it must not be despised. Rather, it should be used to reform our state, society and citizens to bring them closer to the ideal of Ramrajya.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Corona and cutpurses||COVID-19 saw the beginning of a new fashion segment — a designer piece of cloth, cut and stitched, worn on the face, the mask. While one business opened up, another age-old business dependent on a not-so-fashionable piece of cloth — the pocket — is at its nadir. Videoconferencing and streaming apps may have made a fortune during the lockdown, but most businesses and professions have suffered a body blow. But this one is different. Really different. We are talking of the “pickpocketing” business, which depended critically on individual skill, with one single failure sealing the fate. During pre-COVID times, as we checked into a hotel in Barcelona, the first thing the smiling receptionist said was, “Sir, pickpocketing in Barcelona is not considered a crime; it’s an art. Be careful with your wallet. These people here are very fine in their work.” The legacy, the dexterity, the artistry made “pickpocketing” a unique profession worldwide. Plastic money and ATMs sounded its death knell, but COVID-19 was like carpet-bombing, flattening the centuries-old profession to dusty non-existence. Contrary to what most people think, in the right place and time, pickpocketing is a safe and profitable profession — as profitable perhaps as intermittently successful armed bank robbery, but with little chance of arrest or a prolonged prison sentence. Mind-boggling techniques The techniques employed by a cutpurse are varied and mind-boggling. Since the pocket is close to the body, any intrusion is likely to be felt by the target. So the need for finesse is essential, but not enough. A diversionary contact at some other part of the body is needed to distract. It’s also the fine art of hitting someone in a crowd, outwardly accidental and profusely apologising, while another relieves the target of his wallet. “Attention diversion” has gone to hi-tech levels in this profession. It seems pickpockets themselves put up “beware of pickpockets” signage in buses and public places; as you read it, you are likely to touch and feel the spot where the wallet is, saving them time and effort on “target localisation”. But things have changed over time as wallets contain less and less of cash and only plastic. Credit cards are part of the booty, but using them in an ATM involved much more organised team work and higher levels of criminal fraud, which many artists didn’t want to dive into. With the lockdown and strict physical distancing and the stoppage of public transport, the business is gasping for breath. And the art is at its nadir, with no one to write a paean. tinynair@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/corona-and-cutpurses/article32939408.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Palanpur tribune||Moved at the sight of this bare hovel, the children in rags, and their hospitality, I handed a fifty rupee note to the young man, adding ‘Use the money wisely. Maybe you should invest it in fixing the house.’”  To this, Smita, a Dalit schoolteacher, responds brusquely: “‘Who are you to tell these people what they should do? Even with the little money you give them?… Our children have names like Bhukhan and Dukhi. If he invests fifty rupees on fixing the roof, will it make him feel better? No! He will still be miserable on a daily basis.’” This is an exchange from Rumble in a Village, a novel  by Luc Leruth and Jean Drèze — economists both, but writing fiction this time. Layered tapestries Anil’s charitable attempt at telling the Dalit family what to do is justifiably met with Smita’s indignation. The dialogue points at how, among other things, centuries of subjugation manifest themselves even in the names of Dalits. And this holds true for 21st century India as well. The narrator of Rumble in a Village is an upper-caste male who accepts the injustice that his clans have inflicted on farmers and labourers over decades. Despite being on a slippery surface the narrative voice never assumes a patronising tone. In turn, Dalit voices, angry and anguished, are asserted repeatedly. The novel starts with fear looming large over the village of Palanpur in Uttar Pradesh in 1984: gunshots are heard, Anil’s uncle is murdered. After hearing the news of his uncle’s death, Anil, living in London, decides to go back to his ancestral village to unearth the truth. He befriends a frail Babu Ram, a Dalit, and learns that Babu’s mother has been arrested in connection with the murder. As Anil sets out to find the real culprit, we are taken on a journey through the layered tapestries of power, privilege and caste dynamics in rural UP. Palanpur has three main caste groups: Dalits (mostly Chamars), the agriculturist Muraos, and the landholding Thakurs. Anil’s theoretical readings on farming get unwittingly rubbished by Kishan Lal, a hardworking Murao farmer. Kishan becomes Anil’s version of Zorba the Greek. For company, Anil keeps returning to his partner Pat, some audio cassettes, a camera, a billy goat and his father’s diary. John le Carré is distinctly missing. The diary takes us on a historical excursion from 1869, documenting the lives, feuds and prejudices of Palanpur. Anil learns of his ancestors’ contribution in controlling land and the landless through the diary. While Palanpur is very real, it also at times assumes mythical proportions, like Marquez’s Macondo . There are markers of change over time: the rumours of a metallic monster that can go long distances become an actuality when one fine day British generals arrive at Palanpur to lay railway tracks. The novel is a train journey through time and the railway is so endearingly presented that it feels like another character in the novel. Caste calculus For instance, as a train passes through Palanpur in 1932, its half-Dalit, half-British driver, George, blows the whistle triumphantly, as if registering his participation in a village wedding. The villagers react approvingly. Cut to 1984 and it is on a train that Anil befriends a man who, like a fortune-teller, repeatedly suggests that Anil must mingle more with Dalits in his quest to find the murderer. However things might change in Palanpur, caste hierarchies remain entrenched. As does the nature of control — Indian bureaucrats have taken over from colonial officers in managing the administration, but none is closer to understanding the people’s needs. The authors’ keen understanding of rural governance and the caste calculus dictating development priorities is in full bloom here. Should a school or a temple be constructed in the village? To get government funds, the villagers go in circles, meeting a variety of officials from ADO, BDO, CDO to KDO — the authors don’t open out the abbreviations, giving them an ominous ring. The authors’ training in economics can be felt when an academic writing style surfaces, perhaps subconsciously. Some of the characters from the 1984 period could have been fleshed out a bit more at the cost of some characters from history. That said, the plot is well-knit, ironies abound, and there are delightful self-referential digs at economists and researchers. For instance, a self-proclaimed “expert” on poverty refuses to walk in the village fearing that his shoes will get dirty. He justifies his position by saying that it “implicitly confirmed that social change was best seen as a long-term objective”. The protagonist, the 1980s’ rural setting and wit might suggest parallels with Upamanyu Chatterjee’sEnglish, August.But unlike Agastya Sen, who is preoccupied with sex, Anil is more bothered about farming and the murder. One need not rattle off statistics and jargon to bring out the inextricable relationship between caste, power and government bias. This novel proves that a work of fiction rooted in reality can do the job as effectively. The reviewer teaches at Azim Premji University.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||A thousand suns of empathy||For more than 70 years, until his death aged 94 on October 15, Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri was a transformational figure in Malayalam poetry. Yet, his familiar image was that of a soft-spoken, self-effacing personality who preferred to stay out of the limelight. When he heard the news that he had been chosen for the Jnanpith Award in 2019, Akkitham — as he was widely known — reacted with the comment, “My great contemporaries, Vyloppilly Sreedhara Menon and Edasseri Govindan Nair, were equally deserving of the award. Maybe I am now blessed with the honour as I have had a longer life.” That was quintessential Akkitham. Akkitham was a product of the literary churn that took place in Kerala in the first half of the 20th century, which saw Malayalam poetry evolve into a people’s movement. Hundreds began experimenting with the craft, and poetry was in the air everywhere, in dedicated gatherings and recitals, in antakshari sessions on the sidelines of temple festivals, in the verse epistles that became a popular form of correspondence. Kumaran Asan and Changampuzha Krishna Pillai were the folk heroes of the period. They chose themes that touched ordinary lives and spoke of their struggles in an unequal society. Two phases Deeply religious, Akkitham’s spiritualism was, however, part of a wider human vision. The Namboothiri community to which he belonged was in ferment, no longer enjoying the unchallenged spiritual and social dominance that had once been theirs and facing the onslaught of modern ideas. The revolution came from within when younger members of the community, led by E.M.S. Namboodiripad and V.T. Bhattathiripad, took a reformist path. Akkitham chose to join the movement, and this involvement had a great impact on his poetic life. His poetic career can be divided into two phases. In the early years, when he had an ideological affinity with the Left movement, his verse sensitively captured the pain, prejudices and exploitations that abounded in Kerala’s feudal society as well as its slow disintegration over the years. ‘The Wet Clod’, a poem on the agrarian struggle in Kerala, was a product of this phase. His genius, however, steadily evolved to take a broader view of the modern human condition. Akkitham came to see a moral vacuum in contemporary life and society, which he attributed to a deterioration of human values in an incredibly divided and uneven world. Unfettered creativity Two of his most celebrated poems, ‘Epic of the Twentieth Century’ and ‘Broken, Shattered World’, were creations of this phase of his poetic journey. It is here that he matures into the role of a philosopher-poet. In both the poems, he pleads for restoration of compassion and generosity as essential elements of good living. The ‘Epic of the Twentieth Century’ opens with these oft-quoted lines. ‘As I shed a teardrop for others, There rise within me a thousand suns.’ This broader human concern resonates in most of the poems he wrote during this time. Akkitham’s literary style deserves mention. While he wrote on complex issues that define human life, he never gave the impression that he was imposing any lofty wisdom on his readers. His craft was disciplined and his language penetrating. He treasured his long-standing friendship with M.T. Vasudevan Nair, another superstar of Malayalam literature. It’s one of the rare coincidences of history that these two Jnanpith laureates attended the same small village school in Kumaranellur in Palakkad. They maintained a warm friendship over the years. Last year’s Jnanpith came on top of every one of Kerala’s major literary awards. The nation had also honoured him with a Padma Shri in 2017. Even as he advanced in years, Akkitham never let age fetter his creativity. His translation of Shrimad Bhagavatam from Sanskrit into Malayalam, published in 2002, was a monumental effort running into 2,400 pages, a product of painstaking scholarship and dedication. Right up to the end, Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri glittered in Malayalam literature. The writer is Honorary Fellow, London School of Economics.  While he wrote on complex issues that define human life, he never gave the impression that he was imposing any lofty wisdom on his readers||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/a-thousand-suns-of-empathy/article32939421.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Why teenagers in urban India are dazed and confused||Last year, a young man in Delhi rolled his brand-new car into the Yamuna river. The reason: his parents had only bought him a Jaguar, not the BMW that he had demanded. This should have been a moment for India’s point zero one per cent to stop in their tracks and introspect. But they didn’t even blink. Jyotsna Mohan Bhargava’s book steps into the lives of India’s privileged urban teenagers and emerges with an alarming report card: troubled kids, substance abuse, internet addiction, cyberbullying, body-shaming, and mental health issues. Granted, she is writing about a small segment of pampered urban adolescents. ‘Overstimulated and entitled’ It is also not as if the teenagers have suddenly gone berserk on their own — the grown-ups who are responsible for them have. Overstimulated and entitled as the young people are, at least they have the excuse that they are still young; it is the parents who gift their children everything, from pre-teen swimsuit shoots to hair-raising trips to Goa, from expensive phones and Mini Coopers to lip fillers and breast implants. The parents have no excuse. There is also the small matter of the world in which we live. Tolstoy said that the role of educating a generation is played not by school, but by life. Life today teaches young people to gaze blankly at 24-hour news cycles or into the mirror, and to obsess for hours on social media, all the while ignoring the world outside — pandemic, melting icecaps, growing inequality and more. Peer pressure So, teenagers tend to get a bad rap, but they are still children. The teenage years are a time of sudden physical, mental and emotional changes. Hormones change with the onset of puberty. In social interactions, teenagers come under new kinds of peer pressure. They must manage additional schoolwork, looming board exams and career choices. They feel the weight of parents’ expectations. At the same time, they are tempted to take risks and try new experiences. Some of them suffer stress and self-doubt. They become conscious about body image. Through all these challenges, they are developing their own personality and perspectives on the world. Like awkward young birds, barely grown from chicks, they are taking their uncertain steps to the edge of the cliff — from where they must leap into the air and fly on their own. Teaching them young Parents can do a great deal to keep their kids grounded even in this age of rapid change. For a start, they can remain grounded themselves. They can talk to their kids regularly and convey positive messages — a hug, a fist-bump, or just showing up at a football match. They can also say no, often, and firmly, to absurd whims and demands. Finally, they can also ask them to look around at other teenagers who are struggling in a very different reality: a young girl cycling to her village hundreds of kilometres away, with her injured father; another girl running after thugs who tried to steal her cellphone; yet another girl working with her family at a brick kiln in a faraway state, uploading photos on social media to appeal for rescue from modern-day bondage. They, too, are India’s teenagers.   The reviewer is in the IAS. Views expressed are personal.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Easy like Sunday morning||1Born on October 25, 1881, this person was born Diego Jose Francisco ...Trinidad Ruiz y (total 23 words). His first word was piz , which means pencil, and he did his first painting, Le Picador , when he was nine. His signature outfit had 21 horizontal stripes, which refer to Napoleon’s victories. He invented an art form and also the craft form ‘collage’, where you make a picture by gluing fragments of newspaper clippings. Who was this painter who in 1911 was a suspect when the Mona Lisa was stolen? 2This actor was named after an iconic painter. Before he was born, his mother felt him kicking when she was standing in front of a portrait of the artist at a gallery in Florence, Italy. Currently, only 15 paintings of his are known to exist and their combined value is estimated to be more than a billion dollars. Which painter is this and who is the actor, who is worth $260 million currently? 3The Bamiyan valley in Afghanistan housed monumental statues of the Buddha that were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001. Following this, archaeologists discovered paintings on the walls that had been hidden by these statues and dated back to the fifth century CE. They were made using a technique that was thought to have been ‘invented’ in Europe only centuries later, around the time of the Renaissance. What is this technique that uses a viscous medium in the process? 4In 2017, an experimental biographical film based on the life of a famous artist was released. It was unique because it was the first animated feature film in history to be made entirely with paintings. Over 125 painters contributed to the 65,000 frames in the film. Who was the painter? 5This painter famously said, “I am not strange. I am just not normal.” An eccentric figure from childhood, he loved to push the boundaries both in his personal and professional lives. He was also a hustler and master of self-promotion, expelled from art school twice. Who was this artist who was a key figure in surrealism and once designed ashtrays for Air India? 6This artist was brilliant at three art forms: painting, sculpting and architecture, and also dabbled in poetry. He is best known for his mural on a ceiling, a marble sculpture of a Biblical character and designing St. Peter’s Basilica. He started out in life as a conman making duplicate sculptures of famous sculptors and selling them as originals. One of the people who caught him was so impressed he gave him his first job and he went on to create the iconic ‘Pietà’. Who was this artist who defines the Renaissance? 7Norwegian artist Edvard Munch’s most iconic painting is The Scream , which shows a bald figure screaming in agony in front of red skies. Munch said he had been influenced by actual red skies he had seen during a walk in early 1892. One of the reasons he mentioned was an earth-shattering event that had happened in 1883 across the globe. What event was this, which resulted in atmospheric debris that caused blood red sunsets all over the world for months? 8Tatsuo Horiuchi is an 80-year-old Japanese artist who renders beautiful paintings of cherry blossoms, bamboo forests and mountains. What sets him apart is the unique tool he uses. Since he couldn’t afford expensive painting supplies or even a basic drawing program for his computer, he turned to another Windows program that came free with his computer. What tool is this that every corporate professional makes excellent use of every day? 9Willard Wigan is a British artist and sculptor who is renowned for his works that are always displayed on two specific entities. He works on his art only between heartbeats because even the slightest tremor can destroy his work. His usual mediums are a grain of rice or a coffee bean. He displays them either on the tip of something or in the eye of something you would find in a sewing kit. Where does Wigan display his art work? 10Polish conceptual artist Rafal Bujnowski planned to visit the United States in 2004. As part of the official process, he submitted a miniature self-portrait of himself for a document. Although this could have led to revocation if they had found out, the portrait was so realistic that he eventually obtained a U.S. government-certified document that had his portrait.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Notes from Baijnath||For a handful of places across India, the celebration of good versus evil that today’s Dussehra festival espouses is not as definitively black or white as most would like it to be. But then, nor is the mythology that birthed it and thousands of other festivals — both religious and otherwise — not just in India, but around the world as well. There are a myriad interpretations. Just ask the inhabitants of the sleepy little town of Baijnath in Himachal Pradesh. This year’s Dussehra might be muted across the country due to the pandemic, but in Baijnath, Dussehra has always been an annual no-show. Unsung hero or wrathful foe? Perched at an altitude of 4,311 feet on the Himalayan Dhauladhar mountain range, Baijnath is one of those rare places in India where Dussehra has never been celebrated, nor has the ensuing drama of the Ram Leela ever played out. All of this, thanks to an unlikeliest protagonist at the very vortex of it all — Ravana. Legend has it that the ‘demon king of Lanka’ was an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva and prayed to him deep in the Himalayas seeking immortality. In return for which, Ravana chopped off his own ten heads at the altar. So impressed was Shiva with this act of devotion that he is said to have restored the heads — only this time, six of the heads for the six most significant Puranas and four for the four Vedas . The 12th century Baijnath rock temple constructed in the Nagara style of architecture and the surrounding town of the same name were built upon this myth. And to this day, in honour of Ravana’s dedication, neither is Ravana’s effigy burnt by the residents, nor do they buy sweets or light fireworks. Interestingly, the town is also totally devoid of jewellery shops. This is apparently to mourn Hanuman’s torching of Ravana’s Lanka which was said to be made of gold. However, according to some, it is not entirely respect for Ravana but also an all-consuming emotion of fear that prevents any Dussehra celebrations from taking place in Baijnath. As in most small towns across India, myths of destructive wrath and punishment abound here too. Everything from decades of bad luck to more ominous omens in the form of unnatural deaths to those who take part in any Dussehra festivities keep the Baijnath townsfolk away from celebrating on Dussehra night. Dussehra dodgers Baijnath, however, is not alone in its shunning of Dussehra. There are other Ravana-sympatico places in India where the shine of Dussehra is a tad diminished, if not fully taken off. While the people of Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh refer to Ravana as their ‘son-in-law’, as they believe that their town is the paternal home of his wife, Mandodari, Bisrakh in Uttar Pradesh claims him as its own. According to local belief, Ravana, the son of a sage named Vishrava and Kaikeshi, a Daitya princess, was born in Bisrakh. As it is believed that Mandore in Rajasthan is where Ravana married Mandodari, on the day of Dussehra, priests of the local Ravan Ki Chanwari temple here perform the shraadh ceremony for his soul. In Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district, the village of Paraswadi is nothing but a glorified hamlet, home to a handful of people from the Gond tribe. They call themselves Ravanwashis or descendants of Ravana, resolutely refusing to be identified as Hindus. But perhaps there is no better place than one actually named after Ravana to seek an answer to the million dollar “was he good or evil?” question. Ravangram in Madhya Pradesh is a village that has a legion of devotees who actually worship a 10-feet-long reclining statue of Ravana in an ancient temple constructed by a sect called the Kanyakubja Brahmins that Ravana was said to be a member of. Putting it all into perspective, one cannot help but ponder over a rather controversial quote often attributed to Winston Churchill. Is history truly written by the victors? The Mumbai-based writer and restaurant reviewer is passionate about food, travel and luxury, not necessarily in that order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/notes-from-baijnath/article32939467.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Another age of calamity||As COVID-19 numbers began to be thrown around the world together with adjectives like ‘unprecedented’, writers responded to the pandemic by “interweaving words”. After all, that’s what literature does well, says Ilan Stavans in his introduction to And We Came Outside and Saw the Stars Again : championing nuance while resisting the easy tricks of generalization. Quarantine in Gaza Fifty writers have contributed to the anthology, representing 35 countries and “arriving in about a dozen languages”. Their accounts take in all aspects of a rampaging pandemic: fear, dread, helplessness, hope, past, present, future — and how the “reminder of Death brings reminders of Life.” If Jhumpa Lahiri writes an impassioned letter in Italian to the country she has adopted, for journalist Majed Abusalama, born and raised in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza, the lockdown reminds him of the Intifada (uprising) and lockdowns, curfews and a variety of restrictions. Living in Berlin, his mind wanders to Gaza and the Jabalia camp “which has 113,000 people living in an area that covers a bit more than half a sq km.” The virus on the prowl leads Peru’s Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa to conclude that for human beings “what will never pass is our fear of death, of the afterlife...” He wonders why it is difficult for mankind “to accept that all of life’s beauty... belong ultimately to death, and that at any moment it may all come to an end.” In her letter, translated into English by Alta L. Price, Lahiri thanks Italy for the gift of perspective, “an example of what to do, how to be and how to get through this.” Nature beckons The title, points out Stavans, is inspired by the last line of Dante’s Inferno — in which the poet and Virgil emerge from their journey through hell to once again view the beauty of the heavens. Other lines from Divine Comedy make up the titles of the five parts which deals with the eruption of the virus, the need for a roadmap, on empathy, hope and the future. Some writers chronicle the immediate impact of the lockdown on nature. Claire Messud hears the earth breathing around her, and Frederika Randall, the writer and translator who died this May in Rome, tries to understand what the birds are saying. Others like Arshia Sattar cannot help thinking that the “paranoid dystopias” that she had read when she was younger (Franz Kafka, George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, Yevgyeny Zamyatin) have become the “gross brutal reality” now. The last word, however, must go to Sudanese artist and cartoonist Khalid Albaih, who is based in Copenhagen. Tossing out the meaning of the phrase ‘new normal’, he says lockdowns and restrictions are an ‘old normal’ for millions of black and brown people. The new normal he dreams about is social justice, equality, and solidarity. Or to Juan Villoro, author of God is Round who finds it ironic that the world’s governments are slashing funds for culture, when people may be surviving the lockdown, thanks to the arts: “Civilisation began around a fire. The world’s governments should know that it served three essential purposes: warming hands, cooking and telling stories.”  And We Came Outside and Saw the Stars Again: Writers from around the World on the COVID-19 Pandemic Edited by Ilan Stavans Penguin/Viking  Rs. 799||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/another-age-of-calamity/article32939435.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Somewhere in time||South’s three-club bid showed a maximum with a high card in clubs in response to North’s min-max inquiry. Should North have asked? Probably not. It is usually a poor idea to bid two no trump, without a good fit for partner, unless your hand is worth a strong no trump or better. It might not be balanced but it should be that strong. Can you reasonably expect to make a game with less opposite a pre-empt? There might be a game out there somewhere in time but looking for it will lead to a lot of minus scores. The four-heart contract would have chances on a different opening lead. Declarer might be allowed to ruff a spade in dummy and set up dummy’s diamonds before the defense set up their club trick. The club lead was awful for South. Not only was the defense getting after their club trick, they would probably knock out dummy’s ace of clubs, which would be needed as an entry to the diamonds if declarer could ever set them up. South decided to try and use some deception to bring home his contract. He smoothly played low from both hands on the opening club lead! From East’s point of view, a diamond shift was not appealing, and a spade would assist South in getting a spade ruff in dummy. Trying to prevent a spade ruff in dummy, East reasonably shifted to a low heart. South quickly ran off six heart tricks and four club tricks to make his contract.

Whether you have any new thrillers written after 1980s? I said hahaha, young man, this and all are classic novels. Then he went to DVD stand and after 10 minutes came back and said whether I am watching any popular movies or only rare type films. I said, what abhisekham of nonsense you are pouring over my head fellow? Spartacus is rare type film? Zorba The Greek is rare film? Raise the Titanic ? What films you are watching? He said uncle have you seen Christopher Nolan films? Or read books by Knausgaard? Or maybe essay by David Sedaris? Just as my hand is reaching for flower vase, Kamalam came and said, old man, please go and purchase mutta puffs. I said ok. I asked the boy hello, whether you want mutta puffs? He said no, he has not touched maida since 5-6 years. Ten minutes later three of us are sitting in dining room. Kamalam and myself eating puffs with tomato sauce. Boy sitting and looking. I can see the water in his mouth. He asked, how is the puff? Kamalam said kanna you want to try one? Before he could reply, I said Kamalam what nonsense he cannot eat this.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Hits and misses of OTT||Recently, I joined the OTT (over-the-top) bandwagon with my first streaming device. Never did I think I would have to navigate through a multitude of choices and make tens of decisions to finally enjoy an hour of undisrupted entertainment. New concepts have emerged on how we define, enjoy, or watch content. The on-demand model based on choice and convenience implies we have better control over when, where and what we decide to see. And while I appreciate so many choices in, and control on, content, language, pace and so on, it has increasingly become a laborious process. Instead of audience, we have become consumers. Our entertainment choices are now based on concrete notions of productivity and utility, instead of abstractions such as togetherness and collective enjoyment. Convenience and portability offered by OTT platforms have removed the act of watching from its social context and made it a solo, individualistic activity. Instead of appreciating the narrative, we absorb content as a never-ending trail of commodities. However, there is one area where credit is due. OTT platforms have democratised content. It shows stories that are unconventional and sometimes, not very palatable for TV or theatre audience. But while they might be free from pre-censorship, commercial motivations have led to proliferation of content without offering any radical choice. What is disconcerting is that the increasing use of violence and expletives is often conflated with “richness”, “novelty” and “modernity”. Until now, OTT has acted as technologically empowered marvels in a marketplace independent of social worries. But their potential to create a long-lasting impact on the minds of audiences leads to a question: will “de-socialised” entertainment be able to realise it has obligations to society? tanvisoni71@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/hits-and-misses-of-ott/article32939402.ece

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||How an asymptomatic player turned super-spreader||The importance of testing asymptomatic persons for novel coronavirus and the import of mitigation strategies to decrease the spread of the virus have been highlighted in a super-spreading event involving team A that participated in the Major League Baseball matches in Philadelphia in end-June. A single index player spread the virus to 20 other players of his team and to one employee of team B. The results were published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).  Health protocols The Major League Baseball developed new health and safety protocols before the July 24 start of the 2020 season based on CDC’s COVID-19 mitigation recommendations related to events and gatherings. These include non-pharmaceutical interventions such as mask wearing and social distancing, frequent (every other day) testing for rapid identification of people infected with the virus before they exhibited symptoms and isolation of the infected and quarantining of close contacts. In addition, the games were played without spectators. Despite multiple mitigation strategies, including that testing of each player every alternate day was in place, the spread of the virus to other players could not be prevented. This was primarily because the virus spread during the asymptomatic phase of infection. To prevent further spread by asymptomatic players, the Major League Baseball initiated daily testing instead of alternate day testing for all players belonging to team A and B for the duration of the outbreak. Frequent testing helped identify players infected with virus days before they started showing symptoms. “Among the 19 of 21 persons with COVID-19 who were symptomatic, symptoms developed an average of 2.3 days after collection of the test-positive sample,” says the team led by Dr. Meghan Murray from the Epidemic Intelligence Service, CDC which investigated the super-spreading event, in the paper in MMWR . The index case, who was still asymptomatic, received a positive test result on day four of the games before a three-game series with team B. The result was based on a sample collected on day two. The index case was immediately isolated and all players of team A and staff members who were in close contact with the index cases were tested. On day five, after the second game with team B, three more players of team A tested positive. The following day, an additional eight team A players and staff member of team B tested positive. In the following days, eight more players of team A tested positive. Genome sequencing revealed that 17 of the 18 samples that were sequenced had a single nucleotide variant, revealing that the super-spreading event was from a single index case. Outside the field Despite team A playing five games in all, spending a cumulative 11 hours on the field, no player from team B or team C, coaches or umpires became infected. According to the study, the virus spread had occurred outside the field. “Interactions outside of on-field play were likely the source of spread, and SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk between baseball teams while on the playing field appeared low,” the authors write. The employee of team B who was infected had apparently closely interacted indoors with team A tier 1 employees who subsequently tested positive. Additional support “Social distancing measures have been effective in a variety of settings, and this outbreak provides additional support for their use during sporting events, such as baseball games,” the authors note. Universal mask-wearing policies provided additional protection for team mates. “Consistent adherence to these policies off-field also might have contributed to protecting the communities hosting the games,” they note.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/how-an-asymptomatic-player-turned-super-spreader/article32938946.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Problems with the Indian supermodel for COVID-19||We predict the future by extrapolating from the present, based on what we’ve learnt from the past. To estimate how many cases of COVID-19 will be seen in India two months from now, we must have an idea of the number of people who are currently infected. For this, we must know the trajectory of the disease in the past as well as understand how infected people spread the disease to those as yet uninfected. Mathematical models describe this understanding in terms of equations, using input from epidemiologists. These can be used to make predictions for the future. Recently, the Indian government’s Department of Science and Technology (DST), decided that it would support the development of a single “supermodel” for COVID-19 in India. This would combine the best features of models from India and worldwide. A high-level committee was set up to do this, composed of eminent scientists, including several epidemiologists. The report of the committee, in the form of a presentation of the National Supermodel Committee and a paper that was fast-tracked in the Indian Journal of Medical Research, are available. Let’s divide the report into two parts. The first contains general recommendations for India. The eminence of the panel adds weight. It warns that the gains of the past several months can be dissipated if distancing measures are reduced in the upcoming festival season. It stresses that continued attention to masking is critical. It suggests that, provided we pay attention to these, India may hope to enter the new year without seeing any further sustained increase in the number of cases. All these points are almost certainly valid. All the members of the supermodel committee have signed on to this part of the report. The second is the work described in the published paper about the supermodel. Only three members of the committee are authors of this paper. The authors are an eminent computer scientist, an applied mathematician famous for work in control theory and a distinguished ex-army officer with a medical background. All are well known. None are epidemiologists, even though the committee as a whole possessed this expertise. First, the supermodel assumes something unusual. All generally accepted models for COVID-19 so far assume that everyone is equally susceptible to it. Nothing we know suggests that this should not be the case. However, an unusual feature of COVID-19 is that some fraction of people infected with the virus do not display symptoms, while being able to infect others. About 30-60% of those infected, perhaps more, are such asymptomatic carriers of infection. Why this is so is still unknown. The supermodel takes a new route. It assumes that the population prior to infection can be divided into two separate parts. One part will always be either asymptomatically infected while the other will always exhibit symptoms. The supermodel assumes that “immunity levels, genetic disposition and co-morbidities” might determine this assignment. The truth is, we just don’t know this. Testable consequence This choice has one specific testable consequence. If we took a random sub-set of people, say healthcare workers drawn from the general population, we should then expect to see the same proportion of asymptomatic versus symptomatic patients in them as in the general population. This is not what is seen. Around the world, healthcare workers are at more risk of severe infection and death than members of the general population. This suggests that it is the amount of exposure to the virus that may be important in determining whether an individual will exhibit symptoms. More parameters A second point is the following: A model should have as few numbers as possible that must be provided by the modeller to describe the data (parameters). For virtually all such models, such parameters must be estimated. The more the number of parameters, the larger the significance of uncertainties in these numbers, even as more parameters provide more flexibility. The supermodel ostensibly has just four parameters. It fits the count of new cases well, reproducing the recent peak in Indian cases as well as the two peaks that Delhi saw. Let’s dig a little deeper. The model divides the period between the start of the pandemic and the date at which the results were obtained into six parts. These four parameters all take different values in each of these parts. This gives 24 parameters in all, all separately varied to fit the case count. These parameters are not constrained in any way by an understanding of COVID-19 epidemiology. Worse, some of the parameters are then varied across a large range, from 67 to 4,75,000 in one case. There is no justification provided for this. It makes little sense to have so many parameters, all changing, in a model. Indeed, a quote from the mathematician John von Neumann applies here: “With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk”. Lives at stake There are many more problems with both the model and the conclusions it arrives at. However, just this discussion should indicate that the government’s supermodel is ill-suited to address questions of COVID-19 spread in India. Basing public health policies on models that are flawed is dangerous, since the lives of people are at stake and false optimism carries risks with it. Science should not serve political ends. There are better models. Choosing this one to be India’s ‘supermodel’ presents a misleading picture of India's capabilities in both epidemiology and modelling.  (Gautam I.

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Evidence of dairy production in the Indus Valley Civilisation||The year 2020 marks 100 years of discovery of Indus Valley Civilisation, and a new study has shown that dairy products were being produced by the Harappans as far back as 2500 BCE. By analysing residues on ancient pots, researchers show the earliest direct evidence of dairy product processing, thus throwing fresh light on the rural economy of the civilisation. The studies were carried out on 59 shards of pottery from Kotada Bhadli, a small archeological site in present-day Gujarat. “When we talk about Harappans, we always refer to the metropolitan cities and the big towns. But we have no idea of the parallel economy — agro-pastoral or rural. We know they had great urban planning, trading systems, jewellery making. But we don't have any idea how the common masters were living during the Harappan times, their lifestyle and how they were contributing in the larger network,” explains Prabodh Shirvalkar, from the Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology at the Deccan College Postgraduate and Research Institute, Pune. He is one of the authors of the papers published in Scientific Reports.  Carbon isotope studies The team used molecular analysis techniques to study the residues from ancient pottery. “Pots are porous. So as soon as we put any liquid form of food, it will absorb it. The pot preserves the molecules of food such as fats and proteins. Using techniques like C16 and C18 analysis we can identify the source of lipids,” adds Kalyan Sekhar Chakraborty, the first author of the paper, from the Department of Anthropology, University of Toronto, Canada. When asked if this proves that the Harappans made curd and cheese, Dr. Chakraborty adds: “It is very difficult to pinpoint. Traces were seen in cooking vessels indicating that milk may have been boiled and consumed. We also found residues in a bowl showing that either heated milk or curd could have been served. There are also remains of a perforated vessel, and similar vessels were used in Europe to make cheese. So it is possible that they were further processing milk into different forms.” Animal husbandry The team was also able to show which type of animals were being used for dairy production. They studied the tooth enamel from fossils of cattle, water buffalo, goat and sheep found in the area. Cows and water buffalo were found to consume millets, while sheep and goats ate nearby grass and leaves. A preliminary study suggested that most of the cattle and water-buffalo died at an older age, suggesting they could have been raised for milk, whereas the majority of goat/sheep died when they were young, indicating they could have been used for meat. “The Harappans did not just use dairy for their household. The large herd indicates that milk was produced in surplus so that it could be exchanged and there could have been some kind of trade between settlements. This could have given rise to an industrial level of dairy exploitation,” adds Dr. Chakraborty. He concludes: “The most fascinating thing about the Indus Valley Civilisation is that it is faceless — there is no king, no bureaucratic organisations, but there are these very close regional interactions between settlements, a symbiotic relationship of give and take that helped the civilisation survive for so long.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/evidence-of-dairy-production-in-the-indus-valley-civilisation/article32938936.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Room temperature superconductivity, possible but under severe pressure||Starting from hydrogen sulphide, infamous for its rotten-egg smell, a group of researchers at University of Rochester, Intel corporation and University of Nevada in the U.S. have created a material that is superconducting at 15 degrees Celsius. That is, it shows zero resistance to the flow of electricity through it. Such a material would have hitherto unheard of applications from power supplies to quantum computers. The only caveat is that it needs ultrahigh pressure of about 2 million atmospheres to achieve this transition, putting off any thoughts of application to the future. The research, published in Nature, has sparked off animated discussions in the world of physics. “Ever since Wigner and Huntington (1935) predicted that solid hydrogen can be metallised by application of a pressure of about 25 Gigapascal (GPa), the high-pressure physics community has been after metallisation of hydrogen,” says G. Baskaran, Distinguished Professor of Physics at IIT Madras and Distinguished Visiting Research Chair at Perimeter Institute, Waterloo, Canada, who is an expert in the field of superconductivity. “Ashcroft (1968) gave a new impetus to this search and suggested that within conventional BCS mechanism of superconductivity, in view of light mass of H atom, superconducting Tc of metallic hydrogen will reach room temperature scales,” explains Prof. Baskaran Breakthrough In 2015, a breakthrough happened when a group led by M.I. Eremets managed to apply pressure on hydrogen sulphide and get a superconductor at 200 kelvin (minus 73 degrees Celsius). Prof. Baskaran adds, “It was followed by superconductivity in few more hydride superconductors. Until recently, the record holder was Lanthanum superhydride (LaH10). Its Tc is about 250 K, which is room temperatures in polar regions!”. The researchers made three tests to verify that this phase was indeed a superconductor: First, they measured resistance as a function of temperature and found that it did fall to a vanishingly small value below the critical temperature, Tc. A true superconductor would, if placed in a magnetic field, try to push out the field from its interior. This is called perfect diamagnetism, and the group ascertained that the magnetic susceptibility was that of a diamagnet. Thirdly, it is known that sufficiently high magnetic fields can destroy superconductivity in a material. The researchers applied high magnetic fields up to 9 tesla and showed the suppression of the transition temperature to lower and lower values as the magnetic field increased. If you extrapolate this relationship, they show that at around 62 tesla the magnetic field would destroy the superconductivity completely. Commenting on the high pressure that was needed to create this material, Ranga P. Dias, from the University of Rochester and the corresponding author of the paper, says in an email to The Hindu that the pressure they needed was 267 Gigapascals, or 2.6 million atmospheres. “The pressure at the centre of the Earth is 360 GPa, so it is 75% of the pressure at centre of the Earth,” he adds. Diamond jaws They achieved this by squeezing a tiny volume of the substance between the jaws of a diamond anvil. “We have broken many diamonds. It’s very challenging to keep this material to very high pressure because of the hydrogen diffusion,” he reveals. “The next challenge will be to produce these materials that are stable (or metastable) at ambient pressure via ‘compositional tuning’ so they will be even more economical to mass produce,” says Dr. Dias.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/room-temperature-superconductivity-possible-but-under-severe-pressure/article32938941.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Smell a fish||Why is fish smell unpleasant for some people? Researchers have found that some people carry a mutation in a particular gene that makes fish odour less intense. An olfactory receptor gene called trace amine-associated receptor 5 (TAAR5) was pinpointed as the reason for this smell variation. The study conducted in Iceland involved examining the olfactory genes in humans. A sniff test was conducted for over 9,000 people. Participants were asked to smell odours from pen-like devices. After sniffing each pen, the researchers asked what the smell was, the intensity, and the pleasantness of that smell. They sniffed key ingredients found in licorice, cinnamon, fish etc. The TAAR5 variant affects perception of fish odour containing trimethylamine, a compound found in rotten and fermented fish. In the smell tests, those participants who have the gene variant were more likely to not smell anything when presented with the fish odour or could only smell it with less intensity and often named the odour incorrectly. The results were published in Current Biology. A note from Cell Press adds that while humans have fewer olfactory genes compared to other species, some of the genetic variations that people do carry makes them more sensitive to particular smells such as licorice or cinnamon, not less. The researchers say they will continue to collect data on odour perception and have also planned to investigate the smell deficits in COVID-19 patients||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/smell-a-fish/article32938939.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||It’s a mootu point||Eindhoven in the Netherlands is seeing a surge in visitors, albeit virtually. The 19th Dutch Design Week has kicked off and people are logging on to check out over 500 exhibits in 3D viewing rooms. Think light installations with discarded lenses, living coffins (with mycelium) and textiles woven by drones. But it is an exhibit at the Dutch Invertuals Gallery’s True Matter show that we are interested in. Equal parts eye-catching and confusing, the Mootu Lounger by Chennai-based design firm, The Architecture Story, is shaped like a ‘U’ and strung with moulded leather pieces. Is it furniture or art? Can one sit on it? Turns out, designers and partners Justine De Penning and Deepak Jawahar welcome such questions. “We wanted to take design as an opportunity for divergent thinking,” says Jawahar, 35. “The point was to think of different ways that a body can interact with an object, and the Mottu Lounger plays with perception and interaction.” Also, though you may not see it immediately, the conceptual design has its origin story in the mridangam , the main percussion instrument in the Carnatic music ensemble.  Giving sound form  A few months ago, Invertuals had challenged 22 young designers from 17 countries to work with raw materials from their local context, and to play with techniques, craftsmanship and traditions. “We thought it would be interesting to explore music and design — not in a direct way, but through tectonics [the method of bringing things together] of music creation,” says De Penning, 33, while her husband Jawahar adds, “During our research, we found that [Indian physicist and Nobel Prize winner] CV Raman’s light scattering experiments were inspired by Indian percussion instruments. So we wondered, could it lend itself to design as well?” While debating how to break away from regular modes of understanding form, the duo decided to look at the mridangam . Something that was representative of ‘place’, of Tamil Nadu. “We visited mridangam makers in Mylapore [an area synonymous with Carnatic music] and different parts of Chennai, and learned that the mootu [the moulded leather that covers the two mouths of the instrument] is used for three to four years and then discarded. So it is a generational craft that doesn’t have an afterlife,” explains Jawahar. They took home a number of mootus to experiment with — deconstructing it, immersing it in water, shaping it with another object. “For the final piece, we used the techniques and tectonics of the mridangam to create the story we wanted,” he says.  Walking parallel worlds  This meant working with mridangam makers, hand-cutting 14x4 circular leather pieces, puncturing 48 holes around the circumference (the size of the circles and the number and position of the holes are derived from the mridangam mootu ) and knotting them with ropes. “When designing the framework, we did look at bringing in sound. The shape of the ‘U’, if filled with sound, allows for a certain movement,” De Penning tells me. But the desire to create a minimal translation had them deciding not to confuse the architectural framework with a sonic element. The third piece of furniture from the three-year-old firm — the earlier two include a table made from marble, granite and metal, and a metal origami chair — the piece will not be mass produced, but they are open to commissions. As for the artisans, early suspicions about whether the duo was working on a new musical instrument have since turned into enthusiasm for more such experiments. “It was exhilarating,” Jawahar says. “Through August and September, in the mornings we would have these intellectual discussions on design with the gallerists and designers, and [later in the day] go to Mylapore to collect the mootu and talk with the artisans. As designers, we were at the intersection of these two worlds. It pushed us to relook at TEK [traditional ecological knowledge] and the parallel worlds we are living in.”  The Dutch Design Week is on till October 25.Details: ddw.nl||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/its-a-mootu-point/article32938976.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Varana and the travelling trench coat||Varana, the sustainable luxury Indian fashion brand that’s garnering a cult following internationally, recently introduced e-commerce and debuted its collection to the wholesale trade in Italy. It is the next step — after the Bengaluru-based company opened a four-storey flagship store in London’s Mayfair in 2017 — in their goal to make a big impact abroad. Its pared down silhouettes, quality fabrics and handwork detailing have won favour with buyers, including the likes of celebrated boutiques Blu (Capri), Sam Tessabit (Como), and Popp & Kretschmer (Vienna). Antonio Arcucci, the owner of Blu, says he likes the brand “both for the quality of the garments and its clean, refined look”. Varana also had plans to show in New York, London, and Paris (now cancelled because of the pandemic). Still, “it was a good start because in Italy people know and understand fashion and high quality, and we were well received,” says Sujata Keshavan, Varana’s co-founder and creative director, via telephone. Saskia Terzani, who consults on business strategy (she was instrumental in taking the Victoria Beckham brand global) and oversaw the brand’s Milan debut at the chic fashion venue Hotel Diana, tells me that buyers flipped dresses from underneath to look at the stitch inside. “Their hands touched the fabric; it is old school, but in Italy there is a real appreciation for fabric,” she says. The brand is also set to meet with Harrods and Selfridges in London.  A quiet joy  Much as pioneering Japanese designers such as Rei Kawakubo, Yohji Yamamoto and Issey Miyake did in the 1980s — bringing their clothes, and their culture, to the attention of the West — Varana’s bold ambition is to showcase the finest Indian craft techniques in contemporary styles. “We don’t have many fashion brands in international markets because a lot of luxury Indian wear is traditional and focussed on the local market,” says Keshavan. “India is not a famous destination for luxury although we do a lot of beautiful work for other western brands [think Versace, Gucci, Prada].” She and fellow co-founder Ravi Prasad set out to rectify that, marrying indigenous handwork with functional, refined designs. Keshavan describes this design philosophy as a ‘quiet joy’, confident in its simplicity yet imbued with fine details. Citing the example of Hermès and The Row for their prized tailoring and fabrics, the founding duo hope to propel Varana into that league. With silk shirts retailing for Rs. 40,000, cashmere trousers for Rs. 69,000, and a silk organza trench for Rs. 1,64,339, its price points reflect its high-end positioning. Prasad, who headed The Himalaya Drug Company for years, says, via Zoom, that Varana is “intentionally positioned at a price level that the quality commands. When we sold in Milan, I asked Saskia if the buyers asked about it and she said that, uniformly, they thought the prices were appropriate.” But recognising that entry-level price points could help build business, Varana recently launched a line of organic, craft-infused cotton T-shirts, priced at Rs. 11,908. For those not in London, the company absorbs shipping and duty costs from website sales to ensure pricing parity worldwide.  Global inputs  Today Varana has 75 employees, with two manufacturing units in Bengaluru, and works with eight to 10 craft clusters around India — including West Bengal, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Ladakh. But five years ago, it was a different scenario. Keshavan and Prasad both come from a non-fashion background. “We had no clue as to how this business works,” says Prasad, with a laugh. But they knew they had to find people with international expertise. They hired Stefano Arienti, an Italian with years of experience at Prada and Louis Vuitton, to set up the back-end operations. Arienti’s attention to detail included adjusting the tension in each hand operated tailoring machine so that running stitches turned out accurately. It paid off. Prasad says that while Varana’s units take longer to produce a garment, their rejection rate is only 0.1%. As far as plans for India go, the company would love to retail here but says the current offering needs to be tweaked for local customers. For a start, the weather conditions are different to those of the West. Plus, Indian consumers want visible value for money, and it remains to be seen if Varana’s lack of embellishments on simple silhouettes at a high price point find enough followers here. The company, meanwhile, may do a few trunk shows to test the market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/varana-and-the-travelling-trench-coat/article32938977.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||The chronic battle with malnourishment||The story so far: India has been ranked 94 on the 2020 Global Hunger Index (GHI), lower than neighbours like Bangladesh and Pakistan. The GHI showed that nearly 690 million people in the world are undernourished; 144 million children suffer from stunting, a sign of chronic undernutrition; 47 million children suffer from wasting, also a sign of acute undernutrition. The number of young children in India who are very short and thin, reflecting severe undernutrition, puts it alongside the poorest African nations, with some indicators showing actual declines over the last five years. What is the Global Hunger Index and what determines its ranking? The GHI is an annual peer-reviewed publication by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. It aims to track hunger at global, regional and national levels. It uses four parameters to calculate its scores. One third of the score comes from the level of undernourishment in a country, which is the share of the population with insufficient caloric intake, and uses Food and Agriculture Organization data. The other three parameters are based on children under the age of five years. A third of the score comes from child mortality rate, which often reflects the fatal mix of inadequate nutrition and unhealthy environments. The remaining third of the score is based on child wasting, which is the share of children who have low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition, and child stunting, which is the share of children who have low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition. These parameters use information from the World Health Organization, the World Bank and the United Nations, although all these international organisations draw from national data, which, in India’s case, includes the National Family Health Surveys (NFHS). There is always a time lag in such data, so the 2020 scores are based on data from 2015-19. This results in a 100-point scale, with zero meaning no hunger at all. Countries scoring 9.9 and less are classified as having a low severity. A score between 10 and 19.9 is considered moderate, that from 20 to 34.9 is serious, and a score of 35 or more is alarming. These classifications are comparable over time, but the rankings themselves are not comparable, as the number of countries included in each particular year varies. How does India fare on the different parameters in comparison to other countries? In 2020, India falls in the ‘serious’ category on the Index, with a total score of 27.2. This is a definite improvement from the situation two decades ago, when it scored 38.9 and fell into the ‘alarming’ category. However, its scores are abysmal when compared to its peers in the BRICS countries. China and Brazil both scored under five, and are considered to have very low levels of hunger. South Africa is ranked 60 with a score of 13.5, indicating moderate levels of hunger. In the serious category, India stands with some of the poorest African nations, as well as its own South Asian neighbours, all of whom have better scores except Afghanistan. India is tied at the 94th rank out of 107 countries, sharing the rank with Sudan. In terms of overall undernourishment, 14% of India’s population does not get enough calories, an improvement from almost 20% in 2005-07. The child mortality rate is 3.7%, a significant drop from 9.2% in 2000. Many countries fare worse than India on these two parameters. India’s poor score comes almost entirely from the child stunting and wasting parameters. Almost 35% of Indian children are stunted, and although this is much better than the 54.2% rate of 2000, it is still among the world’s worst. Also, 17.3% of Indian children under five are wasted, which is the highest prevalence of child wasting in the world. There is no change from two decades ago, when it was 17.1%. In fact, the situation improved to 15% in the 2010-14 data period, but worsened again by 2015-19. However, experts say this decline may also be partially due to vagaries in data collection. Hunger is a seasonal phenomenon in many parts of the country, with families dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods, facing lean periods based on the sowing and harvesting cycle. There are seasonality differences between NFHS’s third and fourth rounds, meaning that higher levels of wasting may have been seen in the fourth round, on which the latest scores are based, because field data was collected after a lean period. However, even the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (2016-18) shows the same 17.3% rate of wasting. What is the main cause for such high levels of child stunting and wasting in India? There is an interesting difference observed between child wasting in South Asia and the poorer nations of Africa, according to researchers. African babies are usually healthy at birth, but as they grow up into their toddler years, undernourishment starts to kick in. South Asian babies, on the other hand, show very high levels of wasting very early in their lives, within the first six months. “This reflects the poor state of maternal health, more than anything else,” says Purnima Menon, a senior nutrition researcher at the International Food Policy Research Institute. “To talk about solutions, we must recognise that this is the root cause. Mothers are too young, too short, too thin and too undernourished themselves, before they get pregnant, during pregnancy, and then after giving birth, during breast-feeding. It is more than a health issue, there are social factors like early marriage … If so many young women are starting their pregnancies so badly, then everything else you may do to help child nutrition later is like simply putting a band-aid on a serious wound.” Almost 42% of adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 have a low body mass index (BMI), while 54% have anaemia. Almost 27% of girls are married before they reach the legal age of 18 years, and 8% of adolescents have begun child bearing in their teens. Almost half of all women have no access to any sort of contraception. These poor indicators of maternal health have dire consequences for the child’s health as well. Poor sanitation, leading to diarrhoea, is another major cause of child wasting and stunting. At the time of the last NFHS, almost 40% of households were still practising open defecation. Only 36% of households disposed of children’s stools in a safe manner. One in ten children under  the age of five  suffer from diarrhoea. How do different Indian States compare? The Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey shows wide variability across States. Almost one in three children in Jharkhand show acute undernutrition, with a 29% rate of wasting. Although this is the worst State by far, other large States such as Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka also have one in five children who are wasted. Interestingly, other States that usually fare poorly on development indices, such as Bihar, Rajasthan and Odisha, actually do better than the national average, with 13-14% rates of wasting. Uttarakhand and Punjab, along with several north-eastern States, have levels of child wasting below 10%. In terms of stunting, Bihar performs the worst, with 42% of children too short for their age. Other populous States like Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh also have stunting rates just below 40%, and so does Gujarat. At the other end of the scale, Jammu and Kashmir has only 15% stunted children, while Tamil Nadu and Kerala are around the 20% mark. What needs to be done? Experts caution that there is no magic bullet. Food insecurity, poor sanitation, inadequate housing, limited access to healthcare — all result in maternal distress that leads to the kind of slow, chronic wasting seen in Indian children. Although India has overall food security with record levels of foodgrain production in recent years, access to healthy food is still difficult for poor households. A recent study showed that three out of four rural Indians cannot afford the cheapest possible diet that meets the requirements set by the government’s premier nutrition body. Over the last five years, the Swachh Bharat Mission’s push for toilets for all and ending open defecation may have resulted in better sanitation outcomes which could reflect in better maternal and child health in the NFHS round five, which started collecting field data in 2018-19. The Integrated Child Development Services programme aims to provide food, primary healthcare and immunisation services to young children and mothers. “There is no single solution. Every kind of household deprivation that makes life difficult for women needs to be dealt with. The focus needs to be on healthy mothers,” says Dr. Menon.  Experts point out that food insecurity, poor sanitation, inadequate housing, limited access to healthcare — all result in maternal distress, that leads to the kind of slow, chronic wasting seen in Indian children||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-chronic-battle-with-malnourishment/article32938867.ece
25 October 2020||Chandigarh,||Amarinder, Sukhbir engage in war of words over farm laws||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal once again on Saturday attacked each other over the Centre’s farm laws. While Capt. Amarinder said the SAD chief has “lost political narrative” over the issue, Mr. Badal alleged that the State Bills passed against the farm laws aimed at sabotaging the farmers’ stir. According to a statement, Capt. Amarinder said Mr. Badal seemed to have been jolted into desperation by the entire farm laws saga, which had exposed the double standards of the Akalis. Reacting to Mr. Badal’s statement, accusing the CM of colluding with the Centre to get the rail blockade by farmers lifted, Capt. Amarinder said that strange and senseless remarks showed the Akali leader had completely lost the political narrative, causing him to fumble for words and desperate to find a way out. On the Akali chief’s suggestion that the State government should have taken the SAD’s advice before bringing the Bills in the Assembly, the CM said, “It seems the NDA government at the Centre has taken the advice of their then allies, the Akalis, in the matter of the anti-farmer, anti-federal and anti-Constitutional farm laws.” “That would explain why they messed it up so badly and took the unilateral decision to impose laws that are clearly designed to ruin farmers,” he added. “Does Sukhbir really believe that I would lead my party to a political suicide with such an act?” asked Capt. Amarinder. Meanwhile, Mr. Badal accused the Chief Minister of not taking his party’s suggestion and said he instead chose to enter into a deal with the Centre and get ‘wishy-washy’ Bills passed with the sole intention of sabotaging the farmers’ agitation. He said the only solution was declaring the entire State as a principal market yard which would have negated the implementation of the Central farm laws in Punjab. He asked the CM if he had annulled the Central agriculture marketing laws and when the new Bills passed in the Vidhan Sabha would come into being.  The Punjab Assembly on Tuesday had adopted a resolution rejecting the Centre’s new farm laws and passed four bills to counter the Centre’s farm laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/amarinder-sukhbir-engage-in-war-of-words-over-farm-laws/article32939013.ece
25 October 2020||New Delhi,||CM inaugurates two flyovers in east Delhi||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday inaugurated the newly constructed Seelampur-Shastri Park flyover, which will be a major relief to commuters between Welcome in north-east Delhi and Kashmere Gate and Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border. Congratulating the people of Delhi and the PWD officials and engineers for the completion of the project, Mr. Kejriwal said that the residents were proud of living in the national capital due to all the facilities and amenities provided by the Delhi government. The Shastri Park flyover consists of six lanes and is constructed at a length of 700 metres, whereas the Seelampur flyover is constructed at a length of 1,200 metres and eases the commute of vehicles travelling over the Dharampura crossing towards Shahdara. The construction of the new flyover will bring relief to around 1.5 lakh vehicles which seem to travel through the route daily. “First of all, I want to congratulate the residents of East Delhi for these two flyovers. The people of East Delhi used to face long traffic jams for longer hours. But now, travel from ISBT to U.P. border can now be completed within a span of 10 minutes without any traffic jams and with a smooth ride,” Mr. Kejriwal said.  “The flyover constructed is of good quality. The tender sanctioned for this project was Rs. 303 crore, but, such is the honesty with which the AAP government functions that our engineers saved Rs. 53 crore. With a great construction quality, built under Rs. 250 crore, this piece of magnificence is both economical and effective. Since the inception of AAP government in Delhi, we are saving money on all projects. The AAP government has been saving money in every project,” he also said. Delay in completion The foundation stone for the newly constructed flyover was laid by Mr. Kejriwal on February 10, 2019. Due to the rising levels of pollution and the implementation of GRAP guidelines in 2019, construction projects were banned during the night which brought the flyover construction to a standstill, the government said. However, the flyover was 70% completed until October 2019, and despite the implementation of anti-construction guidelines and a six-month halt due to the COVID-19 lockdown, the project was completed in a time duration of 19 months, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cm-inaugurates-two-flyovers-in-east-delhi/article32938998.ece
25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Understanding potential U.S. election outcomes||The story so far: Voting day in the U.S. presidential election is November 3, 2020. However, millions of votes have been cast already, primarily through absentee and mail-in ballots, made available on a scale that is unprecedented in recent times, owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, the pandemic, and the trail of economic destruction that it has left in its wake, have become arguably the top election issues in 2020, with the Republican incumbent, President Donald Trump, defending his approach as the one best suited to a quick recovery, and his Democratic challenger, former Vice-President Joe Biden, attacking the administration’s pandemic response as unscientific, inconsistent and responsible for the deaths of nearly 222,000 Americans to date. While Mr. Biden is leading in most federal and regional opinion polls, analysts have been cautious about making bold election predictions given the outcome of the 2016 election. In that election, Mr. Trump defied the odds with his win, even more so because his Democratic rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, won the popular vote by a margin of around three million votes. Given that the U.S. has, to date, had one of the worst COVID-19 numbers of any nation, why is Mr. Trump still in the reckoning? Mr. Trump enjoys an approval rating of a little more than 42.5%, considered to be low relative to recent U.S. Presidents at a similar phase of their term in office. Nevertheless, his ratings have been somewhat stable over the course of nearly four years in the White House, the principal reason for which is the intensifying polarisation of the U.S. electorate along party lines. This means that on average, a far greater percentage of registered Republicans support Mr. Trump (around 87%), relative to Democrats, whose approval of his performance is at 6%. This partisan split in support has bestowed the Trump campaign with an inherent electoral advantage, because it translates into a disproportionate share of electoral college votes when compared to the popular vote. Why does the electoral college matter to Mr. Trump’s campaign? The electoral college refers to a process, wherein, based mostly on a winner-takes-all rule, each U.S. State chooses its electors, who then go on to pick the President and the Vice-President. The college also encompasses counting of the electoral votes by the U.S. Congress. For example, if more than 50% of the voters in the State of New York vote for the Democratic Party, then all the potential electors allocated to that State will be Democratic. Each State has the same number of electors as it does members in its Congressional delegation, namely one for each member in the House of Representatives, and two Senators. Nationwide, there are 538 electors, and to win the presidency, a candidate would be required to secure 270 votes in the electoral college. A caveat is that Maine and Nebraska appoint individual electors based on the winner of the popular vote for each Congressional district, and then two electors based on the winner of the overall State-wide popular vote. Even though it is rare for either State to have a split vote, Nebraska had one in 2008 and Maine in 2016. The result of this system of representation is that surprisingly few voters truly matter in an election. The reason is that except for a handful of ‘swing States’, which have the potential to flip from one party to the other, all the others have historically only voted one way and are likely to do so this time too. The States that are traditionally considered to swing include Florida (29 votes), Iowa (6 votes), Michigan (16 votes), Nevada (6 votes), New Hampshire (4 votes), North Carolina (15 votes), Ohio (18 votes), Pennsylvania (20 votes) and Wisconsin (10 votes). However, if opinion polls are to be trusted — and that is a questionable assumption — Arizona (11 votes), Georgia (16 votes), Minnesota (10 votes) and even Republican-leaning Texas (38 votes) might be in play. What happens if there is a tie in the electoral college? This scenario — of both candidates winning 269 electoral college votes – is not inconceivable. For example, if Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Virginia, Maine (except for its Second District), Colorado, and Nebraska’s Second District went to the Democrats along with the firmly ‘blue States’, the Democrats would have 269 electoral college votes. This would require Trump to win, in addition to all the traditionally ‘red States’, Arizona and Wisconsin (10 votes) — which he did carry in 2016. But polls show that Mr. Biden is ahead considerably in both the States. Mr. Trump would also have to carry Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia and Ohio. In such a case of an electoral college deadlock, a ‘contingent election’ will be held, wherein the election of the President will pass on to the House of Representatives. Here, the election of President will be decided by each State delegation casting one vote for its preferred candidate. The Congressional record shows that only two Presidential elections, in 1800 and 1824, have been decided in the House. When will the election result be known? In ‘normal’ years, most ballots are counted by the end of the voting day, with the result being known late in the night. This despite a small number of mail-in and absentee ballots coming in later, small enough in number that they would not change the overall result. However, given the need for social distancing and concerns over in-person voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic, up to 80 million Americans will likely vote via mail, and in nearly a third of States, votes only need to be postmarked, not received, by the election day. With the U.S. Postal Service facing slowdowns through the pandemic, the likelihood of a decisive number of ballots being counted by November 3 is low.  The electoral college refers to a process, wherein, based mostly on a winner-takes-all rule, each U.S. State chooses its electors, who then go on to pick the President and the Vice-President.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/understanding-potential-us-election-outcomes/article32938865.ece
25 October 2020||Ghaziabad,||The AMU connection to Bihar polls||It is said when there is an election in Bihar, it causes ripples at Aligarh Muslim University. Despite COVID-19, this October, the impact has been palpable as former AMU Students’ Union president Maskoor Ahmad Usmani is in the fray from Jale Assembly seat in Darbhanga district on a Congress ticket. The highlight of Mr. Usmani’s tenure in AMU was when he took on the BJP and a section of the media when the Jinnah portrait controversy erupted in May 2018 and it is hard to believe that the Congress would not have measured the consequences before giving him the green signal. Jinnah’s portrait issue The right-wing groups led by BJP MP Satish Gautam wanted AMUSU to remove the portrait of Mohammed Ali Jinnah from the Union Hall. Mr. Usmani argued that Jinnah was a founder-member of the university and was conferred life membership in 1938 and the presence of his portrait in the Union Hall only indicated preserving the historical legacy of the university. But the djinn of Jinnah refused to disappear. As soon as Mr. Usmani got the ticket, Mr. Gautam said giving the ticket reflected the mindset of the Congress. “Hindus know what to do with the well-wisher of Jinnah in the election,” he told reporters. While acknowledging that AMUSU’s presidentship got Mr. Usmani the ticket to electoral politics as the post carries a value across the country, Mohammad Mohibul Haque, professor of Political Science in AMU, said people know the reality of the Jinnah episode. “The current dispensation is facing the anger of migrant labour. To divert attention, Mr. Usmani is being made a scapegoat to target Congress.” Prof. Haque, whose ancestors hail from Bihar, said, “Jinnah matters only for the spokespersons of the BJP and the party’s spokespersons in the media houses.” Coming from a professional course like Bachelor of Dental Studies, Mr. Usmani belied the image of the traditional student politician who stayed on in the campus to fulfil his political aspirations. Ansab Aamir, a student of engineering who watched the 2017 elections closely, said Mr. Usmani was broadly accepted. Irrespective of his desperation to find a political niche, his approach is being appreciated. “For the last few months, Mr. Usmani has been running an intense library movement in rural Darbhanga and Madhubani wherein he proposes to establish libraries in villages as centres of educational, cultural, and sports activities,” said Mohammad Sajjad, professor of History at AMU. “It is a good sign that he is making education central to his politics. He was beaten up by the police and suffered a fracture during the Jinnah controversy but he didn’t compromise. He rather confronted the national media. He is seen as a credible voice,” said Prof. Sajjad. ‘Not an easy fight’ Prof. Haque maintained it would not be an easy fight for Mr. Usmani but as caste remains a significant factor in Bihar politics, Muslim candidates have an advantage. “As the Hindu vote gets divided, the party’s support base plus Muslim vote become an important factor in constituencies where there is a significant Muslim presence. The caste factor exists among Muslims as well but the internal stratification only manifests when the saffron threat is not there. In the assertion of New Hindutva, the internal stratification of the Muslims stands diluted,” said Prof. Haque. Hailing from Muzaffarpur, Prof. Sajjad has written extensively on the politics of Bihar. “From Syed Mahmud, a Minister in Nehru’s Cabinet, to Abdul Ghafoor, who was Bihar’s Chief Minister from 1973 to 1975, AMU has been intermittently providing leaders to Bihar politics.” In recent years, said Prof. Haque, Ali Ashraf Fatmi, the four-time Rashtriya Janata Dal MP from Darbhanga, has been carrying forward the legacy. Mr. Fatmi shifted to the JD(U) last year. “You will find Aligs (as AMU alumni are called) in all political parties,” said Prof. Haque citing Mohammed Ali Kaiser, who is in the Lok Janshakti Party. He said, it’s a “good sign” that the “public-funded university like AMU” continues to provide the “secular Muslim leadership” and that it is “not coming from Deoband and Nadwa”. Analysing the influence of AMU alumni back home, Prof. Sajjad said unlike many other universities that were “catering largely to the elite”, AMU had been providing “upward mobility” to “a large number of deprived sections”. “AMU provides them the tools to express themselves and they use their voice back home. And they carry the connection with the alma mater because they feel they would not have been able to cross socio-economic barriers without the time spent at the institution at an affordable cost.” That’s why, added Prof. Haque, students go to campaign for the Aligs. “It is beyond religion or party affiliations. I remember the special attention former Delhi CM Sahib Singh Verma, an AMU alumnus, used to give us whenever we visited the Capital.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-amu-connection-to-bihar-polls/article32939010.ece
25 October 2020||GURUGRAM,||Baroda bypoll: Cong., BJP trade charges||Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party leaders on Saturday traded charges over lack of development in a bid to woo the Baroda Assembly constituency voters with just over a week to go for the bypoll. Launching a full frontal attack on the BJP on his third day of campaign, former two-time Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the coalition government in Haryana had no achievements to show after six years in office and was seeking votes through political rhetoric and creating social division. Addressing gatherings at more than half-a-dozen villages, including Baroda, Mr. Hooda said the BJP’s situation was so pitiable that instead of showcasing its work, the party was demanding answers from the Opposition. “Our list of works is long, whereas BJP does not have a single achievement to show,” he said. “People of Baroda and Haryana know the difference between the two parties as our government worked to empower farmers. The rate of almost every crop was increased 2 to 3 times during the Congress rule. At that time, the Central government had waived debt of Rs. 72,000 crore of the farmers, while in Haryana, loans of Rs. 2,200 crore and interest payments of Rs. 850 crore were waived off,” said Mr. Hooda. Counter charges However, former State Finance Minister and senior BJP leader Capt. Abhimanyu said the situation of Baroda during the 10-year Congress rule was similar to the darkness reigning under the foot of the lighthouse. He said Baroda remained untouched by development. He added that Mr. Hooda was directly responsible for it since he never paid attention to this region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/baroda-bypoll-cong-bjp-trade-charges/article32939008.ece

25 October 2020||October 25 2020 00:00 IST,||Forecasting COVID-19||The story so far : The India National Supermodel Committee, constituted by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and consisting of mathematicians, computer scientists and medical professionals, recently announced that India had passed its ‘COVID-19 peak’ in September and that active infections by the SARS-CoV-2 virus would fall to a ‘minimal’ level by February. The conclusions were arrived at with the help of a mathematical model. What is the ‘National Supermodel’? When the DST said in May that it had convened a group to track the evolution of the pandemic, it viewed the ‘supermodel’ as one that would aggregate the ‘best of’ existing mathematical models, and hence the name. From February to March, when the relative numbers of infections were low everywhere in the world except China, scientists began estimating the beginning and the course of the pandemic in their countries through mathematical modelling. Using differential equations, that show how multiple variables, such as infections and deaths vary with respect to one another on different parameters, modellers try to estimate the fraction of the population which is infected at a particular point in time. How are the predictions arrived at? One of the models used is the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, which divides a given population into three groups: ‘susceptible’, ‘infectious’, and ‘recovered’. Over time, the number of people in each group change. The number of ‘susceptible’ people is highest at the beginning of the pandemic, for example, since everyone who is not infected is considered susceptible in most cases. At this point, the number of infectious individuals is at its lowest. As time passes, the number of susceptible people decreases, the number of infectious people increases. This model assumes that at any given point of time, an individual in a defined population will be a part of one of these groups. The model’s output is dependent on what is fed into it. In the early months, little was known about the incubation period of the virus, the reproduction number (how many people an individual could infect), how lethal it was, etc. These led to oversimplified projections. With time, data accumulated and improved the models. In the absence of cold numbers, modellers are forced to draw assumptions — on how quickly the disease spreads, the varying susceptibility of adults as opposed to children, for instance — which are a mix of judgment and luck. A key differentiator in the ‘supermodel’ was that it purported to account for asymptomatics. What are the major findings? While the modelling committee was a seven-member group, a scientific paper describing the group’s work and published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research has only three authors — a physician, a mathematician and a computer scientist. The modelling exercise also attempted to hypothesise on what India’s caseload would have been in the absence of a lockdown, or if it were delayed by a few weeks or a month after March 23. The first lockdown came into effect on March 25. If there were no lockdown, the number of active infections would have peaked at 14+ million and the peak would have arrived by mid-May. “There was little qualitative difference between two lockdown timings of April 1 and May 1, 2020. This would have resulted in a peak between 0 and 5 million active infections by mid-June. If there was no lockdown, it would have resulted in more than 2 million deaths. The two lockdowns (April 1 and May 1, 2020) would have resulted in 0.5-1 million deaths. The number of deaths with current trends is projected to be less than 0.2 million,” the authors say in the paper. Is it credible? The model’s declaration of India having passed its peak comes nearly a month after the reported date — September 17 — from when the national caseload started to decline. From adding nearly 90,000 cases every day in early September, India is now adding around 55,000 cases daily. It is not clear whether, or how often, the mathematical curve that shows the modelled rise and peak of the number of cases has been adjusted to fit the actual number of cases. The authors say the model expects a decline and virtual extinguishing of the pandemic by February, on the assumption that existing guidelines on restricting public gatherings, wearing masks, etc., continue and no major mutations making the virus more infectious take place. The authors have relied on data from a popular, crowd-sourced database, ‘covid19india.org’ , and acknowledge that “...the major limitation in their model was the non-availability of accurate data”. Officials from the Health Ministry have been non-committal about India passing the peak, but admit that mathematical models have their utility in terms of planning.    Using differential equations with multiple variables such as infections and deaths, modellers try to estimate the fraction of the population which is infected at a particular point in time||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/forecasting-covid-19/article32938869.ece
25 October 2020||New Delhi,||Delhi riots: HC grants bail to SIM card salesman||The Delhi High Court has granted bail to a SIM card salesman, arrested under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in connection with north-east Delhi riots, noting that the police have failed to provide any evidence that he was directly involved in the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. “It is not the case of the investigating agency that the petitioner [Faizan Khan] was part of any such WhatsApp groups, which were made to coordinate/organise protests against the Citizenship [Amendment] Act, 2019,” Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said. The judge further pointed out that there was no allegation against Mr. Khan that he engaged in any form of terror funding or such other ancillary activity. “For invoking the UAPA against the present petitioner, it is the duty of the investigating agency to demonstrate that the petitioner had “actual knowledge” that the said SIM card would be used for organising the protests,” the court said. “There is no proof on record such as CCTV footage, video or chats of petitioner with any of the group except the allegation that he provided SIM on fake ID in December 2019 and taken a small amount of Rs. 200 for the same,” Justice Kait said. It is not the case of the prosecution that he provided many SIM cards and continued to do the same. It is also not the case of prosecution that he was part of any chat-group or any group who conspired to commit offence as alleged in the present case, the judge said. The High Court rejected the argument made by ASG S.V. Raju that since inception Mr. Khan was well aware about the conspiracy of riots. The ASG had claimed that the SIM card supplied by Mr. Khan was used to manage the various sites and to mobilise the Muslim people of area on the protest sites, which further led to Chakka Jaam and riots in various protest site in Delhi. The judge also took note of the fact that Mr. Khan voluntarily appeared for questioning and did not evade.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-riots-hc-grants-bail-to-sim-card-salesman/article32939001.ece
25 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Education Ministry writes to Kovind seeking enquiry against DU V-C||The Education Ministry wrote to the President’s office on Saturday, seeking an enquiry against Delhi University Vice-Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi, according to senior officials. The Ministry has also directed strict action to be taken against Prof. Tyagi’s appointee as the Registrar of the University. The Ministry’s intervention into the ongoing power struggle at the university could now result in the ouster of Prof. Tyagi, who has been on leave allegedly on medical grounds for more than three months. ‘Misgovernance’ The President of India is the Visitor of DU, the only figure above the V-C in the university’s hierarchy. The Education Ministry’s letter to the President, sent on Saturday, has asked him to use his authority to order an “enquiry into all issues of misgovernance”, senior officials said. Prof. Tyagi is likely to be asked to take leave pending enquiry. The current power struggle at DU came to light on Wednesday, when both Prof Tyagi, and Pro Vice-Chancellor P.C. Joshi, who had been acting the V-C during his absence, appointed different people to the post of Registrar. On Thursday, the Ministry backed Prof. Joshi and his appointee Vikas Gupta, and directed that Prof. Tyagi’s orders issued in his absence be considered invalid. However, Prof. Tyagi’s Registrar appointee, P.C., Jha had written to the Ministry on Friday, insisting that the V-C’s decisions were in compliance with the Act, Statutes and Ordinances of the university. On Saturday, the Ministry shot back with a letter, sent from Deputy Secretary Birendra Kumar Singh to Registrar Vikas Gupta. “This Ministry is in receipt of a letter dated 23.10.2020 received from one Shri P.C. Jha claiming to be Registrar of Delhi University. It is requested to ascertain who is this person and if he turns out to be an employee of Delhi University, then strict action as per the Delhi University Act, 1922 and Statutes and Ordinances made thereunder may be taken,” read the letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/education-ministry-writes-to-kovind-seeking-enquiry-against-du-v-c/article32939005.ece
