03 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘India will not accept less than bottom line in talks with China’||Talks with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) could take much longer, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar indicated on Wednesday, drawing a parallel to a similar military stand-off in Arunachal Pradesh’s ‘Sumdorong Chu’ in 1986 that took nearly nine years to resolve. Adding that India and China must take a “long view” of the border dispute and not just the “incidents” at the LAC this year, Mr. Jaishankar cautioned Beijing against dealing with India through the prism of a “third party”, in a reference to India’s close ties with the United States. In an exclusive interview to The Hindu , Mr. Jaishankar said he could not divulge details of the ongoing negotiations with the Chinese side on resolving the stand-off in Ladakh. When asked about how long the talks, which have seen eight rounds of military commander-level negotiations, would continue, Mr. Jaishankar said it was necessary to remember the Sumdorong Chu crisis of 1986. Several years of talks were fruitless before the two armies, which were eyeball to eyeball in the Tawang region, disengaged in 1995. In between, the two sides signed the breakthrough 1993 agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control. Mr. Jaishankar said for India, the bottom line is that China has violated past agreements by amassing troops at the border and that if “peace and tranquillity” at the border is disturbed the rest of the India-China relationship is affected. “Complicated issues will take time and I will go for what is my interest and my bottom line. I mean, I will not be stampeded into accepting something which is less,” he said, adding that India had undertaken an “enormous military response” in reaction to the Chinese deployment. He added that reports of Chinese occupation of land in Depsang and north Pangong Tso did not set out “the totality of the ground picture fairly”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-will-not-accept-less-than-bottom-line-in-talks-with-china/article33235651.ece

Disaster management mechanisms in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam and Idukki districts have been activated in anticipation of rainfall-related emergencies. The State government had identified 2,849 relief camps to evacuate people if needed, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Wednesday. “Indications are that Burevi will make a landfall in southern Tamil Nadu on Friday morning and by noon it could enter Kerala,” Mr. Vijayan said, advising the public to maintain heightened vigil. People should not venture outside unless absolutely necessary from Thursday to Saturday, he said. So far 175 families (690 people) have been shifted to 13 camps, he said. Eight teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have been deployed in the seven southern districts. The State Emergency Operations Centre (SEOC) had assessed the evolving weather scenario and adopted necessary measures, Mr. Vijayan said. The Air Force, which has made arrangements at its Sulur station, and the Navy are on standby. The State government had apprised Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the steps taken to tackle contingencies, he said. Deep depression Going by the present indications, Burevi might weaken into a deep depression by the time it approaches Kerala, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The national weather agency has put Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha on red alert for extremely heavy rainfall for Thursday, while Kottayam, Ernakulam and Idukki are on orange alert. All seven districts are on orange alert for heavy to very heavy rainfall on Friday, and on yellow alert for isolated heavy rainfall on Saturday. Given this scenario, the government is anticipating the possibility of flooding in low-lying and urban regions and landslips in the hilly areas. The State has suspended fishing activities till Saturday with sea conditions along Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Lakshadweep and Maldives coasts expected to be rough to very rough.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/burevi-races-towards-state-4-districts-put-on-red-alert/article33235772.ece
03 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Farmers demand special session of Parliament||One week after they began protests on the borders of Delhi, farmers’ groups have demanded that the Centre call a special session of Parliament to repeal the three new agriculture reform laws. If their demands are not met, they threatened to “choke” the capital by blocking more highways entering the city. A truckers’ confederation also threatened a strike in northern India from December 8 in support of the farmers. Demand non-negotiable “Our demand is non-negotiable. We want the three laws repealed immediately,” said Krantikari Kisan Union president Darshan Pal on the eve of the fourth round of talks with the government. “We will give our written objections, and we will sit for discussions one, two, three, four days but as long as our demand is not met, we will intensify the struggle here and in the rest of the country. The other borders of Delhi will be sealed as well, and the city will be even more choked,” he said, speaking at a joint press conference of the protest leadership on the Singhu border point on Wednesday. The leaders said they were not willing to get bogged down in a clause-by -clause discussion as their demand was full repeal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/farmers-demand-special-session-of-parliament/article33235648.ece
03 December 2020||MANGALURU,||Rs. 6 lakh compensation each for families of dead fishermen||Minister for Fisheries and Dakshina Kannada district in-charge Kota Srinivas Poojari on Wednesday said that Rs. 6 lakh compensation each to the families of six victims of Monday’s fishing vessel tragedy has been announced on the direction of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. In a tweet, the Minister said that he would urge the Chief Minister to provide additional assistance to these families. Interacting with family members and relatives of the six fishermen at the Government Wenlock Hospital earlier in the day here, Mr. Poojari said that an inquiry would also be ordered into the mid-sea capsizing of the purse seine vessel Shree Raksha. The vessel with 25 fishermen onboard capsized about 8 nautical miles off Mangaluru coast on Monday night with six occupants going missing. Meanwhile, search teams recovered three bodies of missing fishermen, Hassainar (25), Zia alias Ziaulla (32), both residents of Kasaba Bengre, and Chinthan (21), resident of Bokkapatna Bengre, on Wednesday, said Coastal Security Police Inspector, Mangaluru, Gangi Reddy. Ansar is yet to be found, while the bodies of Panduranga Suvarna and Preetham were retrieved on Tuesday. More relief sought The Bandaru Shramikara Sangha has demanded a compensation of Rs. 25 lakh each to the families of the victims as well as a government job to one family member each. Speaking at a condolence meeting at the Old Port here, sangha general secretary and DYFI district president B.K. Imtiyaz said that one of the fishermen onboard Shree Raksha, Nizam Bengre, displayed extreme valour in rescuing 18 of them by releasing dinghies with great difficulty. Fishermen and workers in the Old Port area suspended their work for the day and held a silent meeting in honour of the six fishermen. Fish markets across the city too did not conduct any business. Stating that fishermen work under very hard conditions, the sangha demanded formation of a welfare board for fishermen and workers. Mr. Imtiyaz said that the district administration should immediately release the compensation, failing which the sangha would launch a protest. Sangha president Willy Wilson, vice-president Hassan Monu Bengre and others were present.  An inquiry will be ordered into the mid-sea capsizing of the purse seine vessel Shree Raksha which was carrying 25 fishermen onboard and a large haul of fish||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rs-6-lakh-compensation-each-for-families-of-dead-fishermen/article33236276.ece
03 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,||CM launches Amul project to strengthen dairy sector||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday launched AP-Amul project in virtual mode. The project envisages strengthening of the dairy sector, besides economic empowerment of women. In the first phase, 400 villages spread across three districts will benefit from it. Mr. Jagan said that the government wanted to give a better price to milk cooperatives and generate competition in the market so the private dairies would eventually pay more. Moved by the plight of the dairy farmers during his padayatra, the Chief Minister decided to mitigate their woes and the government embarked on this project by signing an MoU with Amul on July 21. As part of the AP-Amul project, 9,899 villages across the State would be brought under milk production, where Bulk Milk Chilling Units and Auto Milk Collection Units would be set up at a cost of Rs. 3,000 crore. In the first phase, milk collection would take off in 400 villages in Prakasam, Chittoor and Kadapa districts, and within 10 days of milk collection, the amount would be directly credited into the farmers’ accounts. In addition to this, based on the choice given by the Cheyutha beneficiaries, 4.69 lakh women had opted for investing their money in the dairy sector. They would be given cattle units in three phases at a cost of Rs. 6,551 crore. After the launch, around 7,000 cattle units were distributed and this will be followed by distribution of 1 lakh units in February and 3.6 lakh units in August 2021. On December 10, the State would distribute 2.49 lakh units of sheep and goats to women who have opted for them. The State has also signed MoUs with major business houses like ITC, P&G and a few others for sustainable livelihood to Cheyutha and Asara beneficiaries. Managing Director of Amul R.S. Sodhi lauded the Chief Minister for inspiring and motivating them to start this project in Andhra Pradesh. He said Amul was being run by 36 lakh farmers with an aim to reduce the gap between milk procurement cost and supply cost, so both the customers and farmers were benefited. Drawing a comparison between A.P. and Gujarat, Mr. Sodhi said that the only difference was productivity, where AP stood first in terms of production. He said soon AP would be the second Amul in the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cm-launches-amul-project-to-strengthen-dairy-sector/article33235639.ece
03 December 2020||Belagavi,||CM Yediyurappa in Belagavi for two days from tomorrow||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa will be in Belagavi for a two-day visit to the city on December 4 and 5, to speak at party meetings. He will interact with senior leaders, including national general secretary in-charge of Karnataka Arun Singh, State unit president Nalin Kumar Kateel, vice-president Nirmal Kumar Surana and other members of the State core committee. The core committee will meet over dinner at a private hotel here on December 4. The next day, senior leaders will address the State executive committee members at the Gandhi Bhavan. Participants in the core committee meeting have two tasks before them — one, short-listing candidates for the Lok Sabha bypoll necessitated by the death of Union Minister Suresh Angadi and the other, preparing for the gram panchayat polls. The committee will focus on the selection of candidates, say party insiders. Sources say that aspirants include Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar, members of the Angadi family [his daughters and nephew Akash Angadi], Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, the former MLAs Sanjay Patil and Arvind Patil, MLAs Vishwanath Patil and Mahantesh Dodagoudar, the former MP Amarsinha Patil, and those with Sangh Parivar background such as Raju Chikkanagoudar, social workers Veeresh Kivudasannavar and Girish Sonwalkar. Senior leaders have received broad outlines about the selection. The candidate should be from the Sangh Parivar background or should be well versed with it. The candidate should fit into the caste matrix of the district. He should be preferably in the 40-50 age group and with good communication skills and should have a clean image, a leader said. “The party is not in favour of fielding members of the Angadi family, at least as of now. However, it will be considered if it becomes an emotional issue,” said another leader who has been in the core committee earlier. However, Mr. Shettar has denied that he is a claimant. “It is an irrelevant question,” he told journalists at a party meeting for the gram panchayat polls on Wednesday. He said that neither was he seeking ticket nor was his candidature being discussed by the party. It is just a media creation, he said. Mr. Surana said that over 400 members of the State executive committee would participate in the meeting online. Around 140 members will attend the meeting in person, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cm-yediyurappa-in-belagavi-for-two-days-from-tomorrow/article33235751.ece
03 December 2020||Hyderabad,||Seven killed as car collides head on with truck near Chevella||Seven persons of three families, including a six-year-old girl, were killed when the car they were travelling in collided head on with a borewell-drilling truck at Chevella of Ranga Reddy district in the early hours of Wednesday. The ill-fated car had 11 occupants including the driver, who were proceeding towards Gurmatkal in Yadgir district of neighbouring Karnataka. Four injured, including two children, were shifted to Government Hospital, Chevella and Osmania General Hospital for treatment. The victims are Mohammed Asif Khan (50), a wielder, his wife Fouzia Begum (40), their daughter Mahek Saniya (18), Asif’s brother-in-law Khadir (43), sisters Naziya Begum (45) and Arshiya Begum (36) and her daughter Ashya (06). While six persons died on the spot, Khadir succumbed while undergoing treatment at OGH. The victims are the residents of Tadban and Bahadurpura in Old City. Chevella Assistant Commissioner of Police P. Ravinder Reddy said that the accident took place between Malkapur village gate and Moinabad around 6.15 a.m. Asif took the car from his friend and was going to Gurmatkal for ayurvedic treatment. “We are suspecting that the car driver could not negotiate the curve due to dense fog in the morning and collided head on with the borewell-drilling truck coming in the opposite direction on the other side of the road,” he said. A case under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code was registered against the truck driver and a probe is on. The bodies were shifted to Chevella government hospital morgue for autopsy.  “We are suspecting that the car driver could not negotiate the curve due to dense fog in the morning and collided head on with the truck coming in the opposite direction.

03 December 2020||MYSURU,||Farmers to protest against new laws in Bengaluru on December 8||Farmers from across the State will stage a demonstration opposite the Vidhana Soudha on December 8 to register their protest against the new farm laws on the grounds that it has a negative bearing on agriculture and the farming community. This was stated by Karnataka State Sugarcane Cultivators’ Association president Kurubur Shanthakumar here on Wednesday. The association cited the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 as being inimical to the farming community. It would result in the government withdrawing Minimum Support Price (MSP), which will leave farmers at the mercy of the vagaries of the market price fluctuation, according to the association. Mr. Shanthakumar said the farmers are being misled by the government on the issue and wanted the “anti-farmer” laws to be rescinded. The Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) fixed by the government for 2020-21 per tonne of sugarcane produced, was also flayed by the association. It said the cost of cultivating 1 tonne of sugarcane was Rs. 3,050 as per a technical committee appointed by the government itself. Yet, the FRP has been fixed at Rs. 2,850 per tonne based on a 10% sugar recovery and farmers will incur additional loss, said Mr. Shanthakumar. Association members also accused sugar mills in the State of fudging the sugar recovery rate to deny farmers a higher rate in case the recovery was in excess of 10%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/farmers-to-protest-against-new-laws-in-bengaluru-on-december-8/article33235861.ece
03 December 2020||Bengaluru,||Class 10, 12 examinations likely to be postponed||With the academic calendar thrown into disarray on account of the pandemic, board examinations for classes 10 and 12 for the current academic year are likely to be delayed by at least two months. Every year, the examinations are held in March-April, but with schools still to open their doors to students, the State Technical Advisory Committee has decided to recommend that the examinations be postponed. C.N. Manjunath, Director, Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, who is also a member of the State Technical Advisory Committee for COVID-19, said that the committee discussed this issue at a meeting on Tuesday. A recommendation will be submitted to the Department of Primary and Secondary Education, which has to take a final call on the matter. “We will also suggest that the summer vacations be cut short in 2021 to make up for the lost academic days,” he said. In 2020 too, SSLC examination was postponed and held between June 25 and July 5 owing to the pandemic. The Karnataka Secondary Education and Examination Board (KSEEB) and Department of Pre-University Education, however, are yet to deliberate on this. “When there is no talk of reopening classes, we cannot draft a timetable,” said an official. Meanwhile, S. Suresh Kumar, Primary and Secondary Education Minister, held a meeting with several Members of the Legislative Council (MLC) representing teachers and graduates’ constituencies who urged the State government to immediately reopen schools in a phased manner. Sources in the department said that they were keen on reopening schools for students of classes 10 and 12 in January, provided there is no second wave of COVID-19 in the State. “We will take a call by the end of December,” an official added.  When there is no talk of reopening classes, we cannot draft a timetable for examinations.

03 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,||Centre willing to rectify lapses in calculating Polavaram cost: CM||Holding his predecessor N. Chandrababu Naidu responsible for inordinate delay in obtaining financial clearance for the Polavaram project, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy said in the Assembly on Wednesday that the Union government was positively responding to his government’s request to rectify the anomalies in arriving at the Revised Cost Estimate (RCE), which proved to be a stumbling block. He exuded confidence that in spite of all odds, the project would be completed by the end of 2021 and water drawn from the 2022 kharif season. He also swore not to reduce the dam height by even a millimetre from 45.72 metres, and asserted that the full storage capacity of 194 tmcft would be reached in about three years after completion of the project. Mr. Jagan pointed out that the cost of Land Acquisition (LA) and R&R package alone accounted for nearly Rs. 26,585 crore at current prices. The fact that Mr. Naidu had agreed to the Centre’s condition that it would fund 100% of the remaining cost of the irrigation component only as on April 1, 2014 and it was for the State to meet the expenditure entailed by latest prices, from its own resources was baffling. Mr. Naidu was expected to know that the costs of national projects had to be updated once in three years and the State could claim funds accordingly, but he nodded his head for reasons to be explained, Mr. Jagan said. He said the previous government was overenthusiastic in taking up the project, which was a commitment supposed to be fulfilled by the Union government as per the AP Organisation Act, 2014.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-willing-to-rectify-lapses-in-calculating-polavaram-cost-cm/article33235580.ece
03 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Honey, the sweetener on your plate may be sugar syrup||Honey marketed by prominent Indian brands failed a key test of purity, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has claimed, citing an investigation it conducted. Current regulations specify around 18 parameters that honey must comply with for producers to label it ‘pure honey’. CSE food researchers selected 13 brands of raw and processed honey, including Dabur, Patanjali, Baidyanath and Zandu, and subjected them to tests that are required under national food regulatory laws to be labelled as honey. Most brands passed muster but when subjected to one test, called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR, that can ascertain the composition of a product at the molecular level) that was done at a lab in Germany, only three brands (spanning six samples) passed: Saffola, Markfed Sohna and Nature’s Nectar (one sample of two). There were often multiple samples tested for each brand. The NMR test is not required by Indian law for honey that is being marketed locally but is needed for export. “What we found was shocking,” said Amit Khurana, programme director of CSE’s Food Safety and Toxins team. “We found that sugar syrups are so designed that they can go undetected,” he said. ‘No adulteration’ Dabur Honey, in a statement, denied that its honey was adulterated with sugar syrup. The company furnished a July 20 report from a German company, Bruker, listed as a manufacturer of NMR imaging product, and performed a test of Dabur’s honey composition profile. That report, which The Hindu perused, says there was no evidence of sugar syrup. “Dabur is the only company in India to have NMR testing equipment in our own laboratory, and the same is used to regularly test our honey being sold in the Indian market. This is to ensure that Dabur Honey is 100% pure without any adulteration,” the statement noted. The CSE investigation also said some Indian companies were importing synthetic sugar syrups from China to adulterate honey. Sunita Narain, director general, CSE, said these were capable of passing off as honey, even up to half of which were mixed with sugar, as ‘pure honey’. Among the tests employed as per Indian regulations is one to check whether the honey is adulterated with C4 sugar (cane sugar) or C3 sugar (rice sugar). Most samples cleared these tests but failed the Trace Marker for Rice test, to test for rice syrup adulteration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/not-everything-about-branded-honey-may-be-pure/article33235646.ece

03 December 2020||HUBBALLI,||Centre to resume gold ore extraction at KGF||The Centre has decided to revive Bharat Gold Mines Ltd. (BGML) and restart operations for extraction of gold ore at Kolar Gold Fields (KGF), where BGML used to extract gold before it was closed in 2001, said Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi. In a release on Wednesday, he also said National Mineral Development Corporation, Donimalai, will immediately begin iron ore mining across 597.54 hectares at Donimalai area, with the State government issuing a notification permitting iron ore mining under interim system on Wednesday. “After the August meeting with Mr. Yediyurappa, I had asked Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd. to explore availability of gold ore at KGF. The study report had suggested a possibility of KGF still having gold ore. Consequently the Centre has decided to restart BGML operations,” he said in the release. BGML, which was in profit, had celebrated its centenary year in 1980 but subsequently had incurred losses finally leading to its closure on February 28, 2001. The Centre’s decision was in accordance with its attempts to reduce dependency on gold import and explore the possibility of reviving existing gold mines, Mr. Joshi said. The Minister also said that during the meeting he had with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in August this year, the issue related to Donimalai was discussed and now the State government had issued the notification on Wednesday. In the current financial year, the State was likely to get a revenue of Rs. 400 crore. Subsequently, it could expect a revenue of Rs. 1,100 crore. It would also promote trade and commerce locally and in surrounding areas, he added. Mr. Joshi said that the development was due to the bold decision taken by Union Ministry of Mines under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and consequently the issue which was pending from 2018 had been cleared now. The Union government had set a target of production of 300 MTPA iron ore by 2030-31 and the decision by theSstate government to permit mining would help in meeting the target. Mr. Joshi thanked Mr. Yediyurappa and Minister for Mines and Geology C.C. Patil for the decision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-decides-to-resume-gold-ore-extraction-at-kgf/article33235753.ece

These will be replaced with names of freedom fighters, social reformers, and ideologues. Social Justice Minister Dhananjay Munde said, “The decision is a step towards creating social harmony and kinship which will solidify the notion of national integrity.” A number of colonies and localities in the State, like Maharvada, Mangvada, Bramhanvada, Mali gully, etc., are based on caste names. “Why should any locality be known after a particular caste? Our leader Sharad Pawar had discussed the issue with me and said this was not appropriate. Therefore, we decided to speed up the process and took the decision to drop such names,” said Mr. Munde. As per the Cabinet decision, the names could be changed to that of freedom fighters, social reformers or ideologues. Similarly, names could also be changed to Samata Nagar, Kranti Nagar, Bhim Nagar, Jyoti Nagar, etc. The Urban Development Department and the Rural Development Department will finalise the process of changing the names and renaming. All government communication, papers and certificates have already dropped the usage of the word Dalit. The Dalit colony development scheme has been renamed Scheduled Caste and Navboudhha Colony Development scheme. Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Dalit Mitra Award has been renamed Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Samaj Bhushan Award.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/caste-based-names-of-localities-to-be-dropped/article33236289.ece

03 December 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Isaac issue before ethics panel||In an unusual move, Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan on Wednesday referred a breach of privilege notice given by Congress legislator V.D. Satheesan against Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac to the Privileges and Ethics Committee of the Assembly for scrutiny. It is the first time in the history of the House that a breach of privilege notice against a Minister is referred to the committee for scrutiny. The decision came after Dr. Isaac gave his explanation sought by Mr. Sreeramakrishnan on the basis of the notice under Section 159 of the Kerala Legislative Assembly, Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business. Mr. Satheesan had alleged that Dr. Isaac infringed on the rights of the House by prematurely disclosing the details of an audit report of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) for 2018-19 by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG). Speaking to mediapersons on Wednesday, the Speaker said the committee had also been asked to look into the fundamental issues raised by Dr. Isaac, in his reply on Monday, on the laying of the CAG report in the House and on the breach of privilege committed by the CAG. The nine-member committee headed by A. Pradeep Kumar will meet on December 4 to look into the issue. “The Minister has pointed out that this was not just a matter of breach of privilege of the Assembly but there are certain unprecedented situations. Let the committee take a decision after hearing both sides,” the Speaker said. According to Dr. Isaac, he thought it was a draft report from the CAG and that he assumed the CAG would seek the opinion of the government ahead of preparing the final report. However, it was only later that he realised it was the final CAG report. Opposition parties attempted to depict the Speaker’s decision as a sign of the abandonment of Dr. Isaac by the party and administration. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said Dr. Isaac should resign as he did not have the right to continue in the post. He had also violated the Official Secrets Act and a case should be registered against him under the Indian Penal Code, he said. Dr. Isaac welcomed the opportunity to state his case, and said the Speaker’s decision was not a punishment as was made out by the Opposition parties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/isaac-issue-before-ethics-panel/article33235579.ece
03 December 2020||AZIZPUR,||Punjab farmers continue ‘Dilli Chalo’||As farmers lay siege to State borders surrounding the national capital in protest against the Centre’s agriculture laws, thousands from Punjab continue to move towards Delhi to ensure that the build-up on the border keeps swelling. At a “24-hour” protest site at Azizpur on the Zirakpur-Patiala National Highway in Shaibzada Ajit Singh Nagar (Mohali) of Punjab, a group of farmers told The Hindu on Wednesday that they were sitting at the pacca-morcha (permanent protest site) with a resolve to ensure that the momentum of agitation in Punjab did not die down even as farmers marched to Delhi. Essential supplies “I am sitting here so that the momentum of our agitation doesn’t drop. Many of our fellow farmers have reached Delhi and several are on the move. Hundreds of farmers from Mohali district in over a dozen vehicles, such as tractor-trolleys and cars, left for Delhi with essential supplies including food, medicine and clothes. This is an ongoing process and will continue till the agitation in Delhi continues. We will not relent unless our demands are met, even if the battle goes on for months,” said Prithi Singh from Phabhat village. Kirpal Singh, a farmer leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur), said while the front-line battle ground had shifted to Delhi, we want to ensure that the protests across Punjab did not lose its steam. “Our demonstrations against farm laws are continuing in all parts of the State. We are sitting on indefinite dharna at toll plazas, outside prominent malls run by big corporates and fuel stations. The reason is to not let the continuity of the agitation break at any cost,” he added. “Also, by staying back we are involved in all preparations for our frontline warriors in Delhi. We are collecting funds, rations and other things from villages. We are in constant touch with our fellow farmers in Delhi. Whatever is needed there [in Delhi], we try to arrange it from here by sending it through vehicles,” said Mr. Kirpal Singh. ‘Not just about farmers’ “These farm laws are a threat to our existence... The Haryana government has installed barricades, barbed wires, boulders on our way but they won’t be able to stop us. It’s not just about farmers now, if we don’t raise our voice in coming times everything will be sold to big corporates, ultimately every section of the society will suffer,” said Surinder Singh of Kurali village, squatting at the toll plaza. “Thousands of farmers have reached Delhi border and we would in large number continue to throng Delhi in coming days. The agitation is not going to die any time soon,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/punjab-farmers-continue-dilli-chalo/article33235602.ece
03 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Global alert on vaccine frauds||Interpol has issued a global alert to law enforcement agencies of its 194 member countries, asking them to prepare for the targeting of COVID-19 vaccines, both physically and online, by organised crime networks. “The Interpol Orange Notice outlines potential criminal activity in relation to the falsification, theft and illegal advertising of COVID-19 and flu vaccines, with the pandemic having already triggered unprecedented opportunistic and predatory criminal behaviour,” it said on Wednesday. The notice includes examples of crimes in which individuals were found to be advertising, selling and administering fake vaccines. The alert was issued on the day the U.K. authorised a COVID-19 vaccine for use from next week. “As a number of COVID-19 vaccines come closer to approval and global distribution, ensuring the safety of the supply chain and identifying illicit websites selling fake products will be essential. The need for coordination between law enforcement and health regulatory bodies will also play a vital role to ensure the safety of individuals and well-being of communities are protected,” Interpol said in a statement. Stating that vaccines were the prime target of organised crime, Interpol Secretary-General Jürgen Stock said: “As governments are preparing to roll out vaccines, criminal organisations are planning to infiltrate or disrupt supply chains.” He said that criminal networks would also be targeting unsuspecting members of the public via fake websites and false cures, which could pose a significant risk to their health, even their lives. “It is essential that law enforcement is as prepared as possible for what will be an onslaught of all types of criminal activity linked to the COVID-19 vaccine, which is why Interpol has issued this global warning,” he said. Given that international travel is gradually resuming and testing for the virus will be of greater importance, Interpol suspects that it will lead to parallel production and distribution of unauthorised and falsified testing kits. With cases of COVID-19-related frauds increasing, the agency is advising people to take special care when going online to search for medical equipment or medicines. “In addition to the dangers of ordering potentially life-threatening products, an analysis by the Interpol’s Cybercrime Unit revealed that of the 3,000 websites associated with online pharmacies suspected of selling illicit medicines and medical devices, around 1,700 contained cyber threats, especially phishing and spamming malware,” it said. “Always check with your national health authorities or the World Health Organization for the latest health advice in relation to COVID-19.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/global-alert-on-vaccine-frauds/article33235608.ece
03 December 2020||HYDERABAD,||Forest dept. issues SOP for fringe villages||Amid growing fear of movement of tigers in Kumaram Bheem Asifabad district and killing of a 15-year-old girl last week in Kondapally gram panchayat in Mannewada hamlet of Penchikalpet mandal, the forest department has issued standard operating procedure for the villagers residing in the fringe villages near forest areas. In a detailed order issued here on Wednesday, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests & Chief Wildlife Warden R. Sobha asked the villagers to take utmost precautions while venturing into the agricultural fields adjacent to the forest areas. The guidelines wanted the villagers to avoid leaving strip gaps/pathways in agricultural fields. That means crops should be closely planted for 10 rows on the periphery without leaving any pathways. Avoid forest routes They were asked to avoid routes passing through the forest areas. The residents were asked not to object to check-gates placed by the forest department along the forest roads. Further, a minimum 8 to 10 people were asked to go to agricultural fields for harvesting or other agricultural operations. In that group one person should be compulsorily deployed as sentry, whose duty is to make sound by drum beating and whistling, the SOP mentioned. The farmer shall stay on machan in agricultural field while guarding his crop. Also, the shepherds were asked to go in groups and avoid taking the cattle deep inside the forest for grazing and restrict to half kilometre from the village. The shepherds should go for grazing after 9 a.m. and return by 4 p.m., forest officials said, adding that every villager going to the field should have a protection stick with small bell tied to it. People working in the field and also shepherds shall wear face mask on the back side of the head, it was pointed out. A village protection committee would be formed with local sarpanch as the chairperson and Forest Beat officer as convenor. Every morning the villagers shall give information to village protection committee about the field they are going, number of people who are going, sentry to that group, number of villagers. They should not go to field with out approval of village protection committee. Monitoring panel Meanwhile, the Forest department has felt that it was desirable to constitute a monitoring committee as per the SoP of NTCA to track and deal with the said tiger with Adilabad Conservator of Forests as chairman. It will have six other members who would draw up a plan of action for dealing with the said tiger keeping in view the safety of the people living in villages in the nearby areas, their livestock and also safety of the said tiger.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/forest-dept-issues-sop-for-fringe-villages/article33236214.ece
03 December 2020||CHENNAI,||Burevi expected to cross coast in the early hours of Friday||Cyclonic storm Burevi is expected to be centred close to Pamban by Thursday noon, and may cross the south Tamil Nadu coast between Thursday night and the early hours of December 4. The system will begin to have an impact on the southern coastal districts from Thursday morning, says the India Meteorological Department (IMD). On Wednesday, the IMD issued an ‘orange’ alert for the south Tamil Nadu and south Kerala coasts. The alert indicates that the authorities must be prepared for the approaching system. Its impact may start from Ramanathapuram district and gradually reach Kanniyakumari. The name ‘Burevi’, given by the Maldives, means black mangroves in the Dhivehi language. The storm is expected to cross Sri Lanka’s coast by Wednesday night. It is likely to cross the south Tamil Nadu coast between Pamban and Kanniyakumari between Thursday night and the early morning of Friday as a cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 70-80 kmph, gusting to 90 kmph. The system will continue to maintain intensity as a cyclonic storm and weaken as a deep depression around Friday night. Showers till Saturday IMD officials said the storm may trigger rainfall till Saturday. Most places in the State would receive rain. The spell may be heavy to very heavy at a few places and extremely heavy (above 24 cm) at one or two places till Friday. Sivaganga, Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Kanniyakumari districts may get isolated extremely heavy rain on Thursday and Friday. Other districts such as Madurai, Theni, Dindigul and Virudhunagar are likely to get heavy to very heavy rain, up to 24 cm, at one or two places. Many weather stations in other districts may receive light to moderate rain, they said. The IMD also warned of squally weather over Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli, Ramanathapuram and Kanniyakumari with a wind speed of 70-80 kmph, gusting up to 90 kmph, on December 3 and 4. A storm surge of about 1 metre may inundate low-level areas in the south coastal districts. Chennai may continue having a pleasant weather with the maximum temperature of 28 degrees Celsius. The city may receive light to moderate rain in some parts till Friday. Officials noted that the weather system is likely to reduce the rainfall shortage in the delta and southern districts, including Thanjavur, Ramanathapuram and Kanniyakumari. The State’s overall average rainfall stands at 30.4 cm, 16% short of its seasonal normal, since October 1. Meanwhile, the IMD’s bulletin indicates a cyclonic circulation over the Malay Peninsula. This may lead to the formation of a low-pressure area over the south Andaman sea around December 4. However, officials said they were monitoring the system, and the direction it would take and the impact it would have on Tamil Nadu would be clear once the system formed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/burevi-expected-to-cross-coast-in-the-early-hours-of-friday/article33235701.ece

03 December 2020||Srinagar,||BJP campaign wagon hits Sopore||Buoyed by the voter turnout in Kashmir, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday took its election campaign rally in tongas (horse-driven carriages) to Sopore, the north Kashmir hometown of ex-Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Geelani and a bastion of the now-banned Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI). Raising slogans such as ‘Narendra Modi bhai zindabad ’ and ‘ Bharat Mata Ki Jai ’, the tonga rally was led by J&K party affairs in-charge Vibodh Gupta in the militancy-infested Mabugh area, with many women supporters. The campaign was for Fareeda Khan, a local candidate fielded by the BJP, for the District Development Council (DDC) election. “A DDC constituency of Sopore recorded 18% polling [on Tuesday]. It was once in the throes of terrorism and separatism. However, the turnout is a message from people that they want peace and brotherhood. Dilution of Article 35(A) and Article 370 have opened up the atmosphere in Kashmir and people are coming out to vote,” Mr. Gupta said. He described the rally was also as message — “don’t destroy Kashmir” — to Pakistan, the ISI, the Hurriyat and the the Gupkar alliance. “The Sopore mandi should have been exporting apples to London and as far as Kerala. Unfortunately, it was consumed by terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will set up an international mandi in Sopore. People should vote for Mr. Modi’s mission and vision,” Mr. Gupta said. The rally comes as the BJP is fast emerging as a significant political player taking on the seven-party Gupkar alliance and dominating many municipalities and panchayats since the 2018 polls, especially in central and south Kashmir.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-campaign-wagon-hits-sopore/article33235594.ece
03 December 2020||Bengaluru,||Bill against ‘love jihad’ may not be tabled soon||In the midst of vocal support from several Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, including Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, to the “love jihad” legislation prohibiting forcible interfaith conversion, the piloting of the Bill in the Karnataka Assembly’s winter session is unlikely, party sources said. The BJP is watching the response to the proposed legislation against forcible conversions, and it is yet to take a call on whether the Bill has to be moved in the coming winter session, sources said. On party leaders sending out contradictory messages, the sources said that the party was weighing options based on responses. The winter session of the legislature will commence on December 7. Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C. Madhuswamy has also said that the legislation was unlikely even as Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi on Tuesday said the legislation would be brought in the State. Meanwhile, government sources indicated that the legislation drafting is under progress though, crucially, the legislation is still to be discussed in the Cabinet before it is moved as a Bill in the legislature. “Legislation making is a process, and the departments concerned are looking at the legal issues. The Cabinet is yet to discuss on the issue. It is more of a political decision,” government sources said. While the Congress leaders, including former chief minister Siddaramaiah, have opposed the proposed legislation, former chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Wednesday told reporters in Mysuru that the government is facing bigger challenges that need to be dealt with rather than bringing a legislation to curb interfaith conversions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/law-against-love-jihad-not-to-be-tabled-yet/article33235575.ece
03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||‘India approaches China bilaterally, with the challenge of global rebalancing’||Negotiations with China are ongoing, says External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar , and hints that they could even take years . Speaking about his book The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World, where he lays out a treatise for Indian foreign policy, Dr. Jaishankar also defended the government’s moves on Article 370, the Citizenship Amendment Act, and trade protection. Excerpts : In your book you speak of “managing China’s rise”. Yet, nearly eight months into the LAC stand-off, the sense is that the government’s reaction has been more diplomatic rather than trying to push back against China. Is this not a ‘sense of fatalism disguised as deliberation’ that your book is critical of? No, no, not at all. I think there’s been an enormous military response. If you look at the troops we have deployed there, it is pretty much unprecedented. Of course, it’s because their deployment is also unprecedented. Now, I would urge you to look at the trend line. Not necessarily at an incident, however important an incident may be, because it is a trend line that gives you the real picture. The bottom line right now is that we have bilateral agreements that commit both countries not to amassing a large number of forces along the LAC. Without credibly explaining why, the Chinese have chosen to violate that compact. The second aspect of it is that the progress in our bilateral ties have been very much predicated on peace and tranquillity along the LAC. If that is disturbed, as has been the case this year, then obviously, the rest of the relationship cannot be unaffected. The challenge today is whether we have the wisdom to be guided by the big picture. I used that term, I think in my book, whether we can take a “long view” of the relationship. My sense is that India approaches China more bilaterally, but with the challenge of global rebalancing. In contrast, I think China seems more affected by third parties, whether in our own region, or whether, you know, in their global calculations. So, for our own long-term future, it is important that we take a bilateral path that is mutually respectful and mutually sensitive. There has not been any incident in the last few months. But the troops remain amassed. There are reports in Depsang and along Pangong Tso north, that Chinese troops have taken over territory, or have made it impossible for India to patrol territories it used to. The question is, if there is no other incident, is the status quo today acceptable to you? I don’t believe your question sets out fairly the totality of the ground picture. I think they have made their moves and we have responded. We are very, very clear that both parties have formally taken on responsibilities to observe and respect the LAC. That, to my mind, is the bottom line. Beyond that, on the question of what is happening today with China and Ladakh, I will be very honest with you, I won’t be answering any of it because, as I said, I am in the middle of an ongoing negotiation. It has been ongoing for some time, which is why the questions keep coming... Well, I don’t know if you remember Sumdorong Chu [India-China stand-off in 1986 that ended only nine years later]. I mean, I know in this day and age, there’s a lot of media pressure. But you know, complicated issues will take time and I will go for what is my interest and my bottom line. I mean, I will not be stampeded into accepting something less. Turning to the U.S., will India need to build a new engagement with the Biden administration, or will there be a seamless transition from the Trump administration? Obviously, there will be elements of change, because at the very least, the storyline, the method, you know, the modality of dealing with others would be different.... But none of this should really worry us. Because when I look at the potential administration, I mean, I see familiar figures with whom we have worked for many, many years, including the period when I was Ambassador, and then Foreign Secretary. As a diplomat, perhaps you would never have thought of boycotting the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee meeting (December 2019), because of the presence of an individual (Democratic US Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal). Do you think you have changed because you have become a politician? A politician by definition is different from a diplomat. Obviously, when others do diplomacy, when it’s a diplomatic situation, you deal with it through diplomacy. When others do politics, you deal with it politically. Of course, I am a politician. You can’t expect me as EAM to behave like me as Foreign Secretary. In your book, you describe India’s delayed liberalisation a big burden on foreign policy. Yet in a speech you gave recently, you criticised free trade agreements, you criticised the impact of globalisation. Is this not taking India back to pre-liberalisation times? No. I think that would be an erroneous reading both of my speech and of the global situation and our policy. I don’t think anybody is in denial of globalisation, the real issue for any country, especially ours, is what are the terms with which you enter the globalisation process and engage? My urging is, negotiate better, get better terms, what works for us.

03 December 2020||Lucknow,||First arrest made under U.P. conversion ordinance||A 21-year-old man in Bareilly, who became the first person to be booked under the new ordinance against “unlawful” conversion in Uttar Pradesh, was arrested on Wednesday, the police said. Uwaish Ahmed had been absconding since being booked under Sections 3 and 5 of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, which was cleared by the State Cabinet last week and promulgated on November 27. This was the first case lodged in the State under the new ordinance, which makes religious conversion a cognisable and non-bailable offence inviting penalties up to 10 years in prison, if found to be effected for marriage or through misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or other allegedly fraudulent means. The FIR was lodged against Mr. Ahmed at the Deorania Police Station on charges of allegedly trying to coerce a 20-year-old married Hindu woman to convert to his religion and marry him. Sections 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code were also invoked. The FIR was lodged on the complaint of Tikaram Rathore, a resident of Sharifnagar village. Mr. Rathore alleged that the accused person had developed a friendship with his daughter during their education and wanted to “coerce, coax and allure her into converting”. “Despite repeated disapprovals by me and my family, he [the boy] is not listening, and is applying pressure on me and my family through abuses and death threats...,” he said in his police complaint. Superintendent of Police (Rural) Bareilly Sansar Singh said a case of kidnapping the woman had been lodged against the accused earlier. The woman’s brother Kesarpal Rathore, however, had said that the case involving the accused had been resolved in 2019. His sister had also married another boy in May this year, he said. He said the family did not approach the police for the latest FIR, claiming that police came to their house and questioned them about the earlier case. The police then took his father to the police station, he said recently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/first-arrest-made-under-up-conversion-ordinance/article33236110.ece
03 December 2020||MUMBAI,||It’s an open competition, says Adityanath||“We have not come here to take away anything,” Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said in Mumbai on Wednesday, amidst concerns that he was in the city to take away the local Hindi film industry to Noida where his government has allocated 1,000 acres for a brand new film city. “It is not a purse, that can be taken away. This is an open competition. If someone who can provide safe working atmosphere, better facilities and social security and an environment in which everyone can work without discrimination, it will attract people and investment,” he said. He was responding to questions on statements issued by the Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Congress leaders on the motive behind his visit and how difficult it would be to shift Bollywood from Mumbai. “We are creating something new. Why are you worried? We will provide world class infrastructure to all. People need to widen their thinking and provide better facilities. One who will do that will be successful. U.P. is prepared for this,” he said. “We are not snatching away investment from anybody nor are we derailing anyone’s development.” Ahead of the U.P. Chief Minister’s visit, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had stated that no one can forcibly take away any business from the State. The Congress, Shiv Sena’s alliance partner in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government, spoke about a conspiracy being hatched by the BJP to rob Maharashtra of its investments. Mr. Adityanath was in Mumbai for the “ring the bell” ceremony at BSE (formerly Bombay Stock Exchange) for the listing of Lucknow Municipal Corporation bonds that were issued under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation scheme. With this, he said, he had created history by becoming the first Chief Minister of his State to ring the bell at BSE. He said the listing indicated the transparency in the urban bodies of U.P. The Chief Minister said since he was visiting the city he thought he would meet Bollywood personalities and industrialists to encourage them to invest in his State. Among those he met were Boney Kapoor, Anand Pandit, Manmohan Shetty and Subhash Ghai. Industry captains who met him included N. Chandrasekaran, chairman, Tata Sons; S.N. Subrahmanyan, MD & CEO, Larsen & Toubro; Baba Kalyani, chairman, Kalyani Group; Niranjan Hiranandani, CMD, Hiranandani Group; Sanjay Nayar, CEO, KKR India; and Suprakash Chaudhuri, VP & MD, Siemens Industry Software Ltd.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/its-an-open-competition-says-adityanath/article33235614.ece
03 December 2020||Bengaluru,||Patient ferried via zero traffic from Mangaluru to Bengaluru||A 22-year-old female patient, who has been diagnosed with congenital bronchiectasis and needs to undergo bilateral lung transplant, was rushed via zero traffic to Bengaluru’s Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences in an ambulance from Mangaluru in a record 4.10 hours. The patient transfer was coordinated by the All-India Kerala Muslim Cultural Centre (KMCC). M.K. Naushad, general secretary of KMCC’s Bengaluru chapter, said the quick transfer of the patient was possible with help from the traffic police, who created a green corridor all along a 401-km stretch. “The ambulance driver B.M. Haneef, who in February transferred a 40-day-old baby from Mangaluru to Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences in 4.20 hours, has broken his own record this time,” Mr. Naushad said. Mr. Haneef said he rushed from Calicut to Mangaluru when he got a call that the patient should be transferred to Bengaluru. “I left Mangaluru at 11.10 a.m. and reached Bengaluru at 3.20 p.m. covering a distance of 401 km. I was a little worried as I had been driving without any rest for the last two days. Also there was a fear of having mechanical issues while driving at such a speed. But thankfully I was able to reach the patient within a short time and hope she gets the required treatment,” he said. Durga Prasad Reddy, cardiothoracic surgeon at Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences, said the patient has congenital bronchiectasis with respiratory failure. “She needs bilateral lung transplant and we will enroll her with Jeevasarthakathe for organ donation. Meanwhile, as the patient is very sick we are stabilising her,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/patient-ferried-via-zero-traffic-from-mangaluru-to-bengaluru/article33236115.ece

03 December 2020||Bengaluru,||Sasikala applies for sentence remission||Former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s aide V.K. Sasikala has made an application before the authorities at Parappana Agrahara Central Prison, where she is serving a four-year sentence in a disproportionate assets case, to consider remission of her sentence and an early release from prison. However, a remission of over 120 days that she had acquired has been forfeited by the former jailer, over allegations of special benefits and for being irregular for work within the jail. The Parappana Agrahara Central Prison authorities have now forwarded her application to the Prisons Department, which is yet to take a call on the issue. Convicts are eligible for three days of remission per month of good behaviour. “Remission is not a right, but a discretion of prison authorities. She has sought a review of an earlier decision where her remission was forfeited. A decision is pending on the application,” a senior prison official said. Meanwhile, Sasikala would complete her sentence on January 27, 2021 if she doesn’t avail herself of any remission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sasikala-applies-for-sentence-remission/article33235577.ece
03 December 2020||CHENNAI,||Former HC judge Karnan held||Former Calcutta High Court judge C.S. Karnan was on Wednesday arrested by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of the Greater Chennai Police. Sources said he was arrested from his house in Avadi in connection with vulgar remarks he reportedly made against Supreme Court judges and their spouses. The CCB held an inquiry at the City Police Commissionerate last week. Following this, the CCB registered cases against him under sections 228 (intentional insult or interruption to public servant sitting in judicial proceeding), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), 294 (b) (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place), 506 (ii) (punishment for criminal intimidation), 67 (A) (punishment for publishing or transmitting of material containing sexually explicit act, etc., in electronic form) and 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) of the IPC. In October, the Thiruvanmiyur police booked a case against five men, without naming the former judge. Later, a video of him making vulgar remarks against women judges and wives of SC judges went viral on social media. This is the second time he is being arrested. A seven-member Bench, led by Chief Justice of India J.S. Khehar, had found him guilty of contempt and awarded a six-month sentence.  Former Calcutta High Court judge C.S.

03 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||There has never been a woman CJI, says A-G||Attorney-General (A-G) K.K. Venugopal on Wednesday took the Supreme Court’s invitation to suggest ways to gender-sensitise judges as an opportunity to tell the court it has never had a woman Chief Justice. He told the Supreme Court that more women judges in constitutional courts would certainly improve gender sensitivity in the judiciary. “Improving the representation of women could also go a long way towards a more balanced and empathetic approach in cases involving sexual violence. For instance, this court has only two women judges as against a sanctioned strength of 34 judges. There has never been a female Chief Justice. This figure is consistently low across the higher judiciary. There are only 80 women judges out of the sanctioned strength of 1,113 judges in the High Courts and the Supreme Court,” he said. Only two of these 80 women judges are in the Supreme Court and the other 78 are in various High Courts, comprising only 7.2% of the number of judges. There are six High Courts — Manipur, Meghalaya, Patna, Tripura, Telangana, and Uttarakhand — where there are no sitting women judges, he pointed out. The top law officer was responding to a request from the court to assist it in a case from the Madhya Pradesh High Court. This court had recently passed an order granting bail to an alleged sexual molester. The conditions for grant of bail included visiting his victim at her home, tying a rakhi on her hand and giving money and sweets to her and her son. Eight women lawyers of the Supreme Court had brought this order to the attention of the top court. They had challenged the High Court’s ‘trivialisation’ of the victim’s trauma. Mr. Venugopal, in his written submissions, said judges need to be trained to place themselves in the shoes of the victim of sexual violence while passing orders. He pointed to the dearth of compulsory courses on gender sensitisation in law schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/there-has-never-been-a-woman-cji-says-a-g/article33235598.ece
03 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Install cameras at NIA, CBI offices: SC||The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the Centre to compulsorily install CCTV cameras and recording equipment in the offices of central agencies like National Investigation Agency (NIA) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which have the power to carry out “interrogations”. The CCTVs and recording equipment, the court said, would be used as a measure to protect the fundamental right to dignity and life. ‘Power of arrest’ A three-judge Bench led by Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman specifically ordered the Centre to have CCTVs and recording equipment installed in the offices of the CBI, NIA, Enforcement Directorate, Narcotics Control Bureau, Department of Revenue Intelligence, Serious Fraud Investigation Office and “any other agency which carries out interrogations and has the power of arrest”. “As most of these agencies carry out interrogation in their office(s), CCTVs shall be compulsorily installed in all offices where such interrogation and holding of accused takes place in the same manner as it would in a police station,” Justice Nariman directed. Large posters informing people about the CCTV coverage should be prominently placed at the offices of these central agencies and police stations. The court ordered that the Principal Secretary/Cabinet Secretary/Home Secretary of each State/ Union Territory should give it a “firm action plan with exact timelines for compliance” within the next six weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/install-cameras-at-nia-cbi-offices-sc/article33235604.ece

This is the first time since 1932 that the conference of of Directors-General and Inspectors-General of Police is being organised virtually. Union Home Minister Amit Shah joined the conference through video conference and delivered the inaugural address at the IB headquarters. Three best police stations in the country were awarded on the occasion. The Prime Minister joined the conference around 5 p.m. and was given a presentation on the “implementation of recommendations of previous conferences”. After a detailed session on the “national security scenario”, Mr. Modi was apprised of the state response to left-wing extremism on successful interventions, strategies and challenges ahead.

03 December 2020||KOCHI,||Indian Navy kept Chinese Navy under check: Vice Admiral||The Indian Navy played a key role in ‘deterring’ the People’s Liberation Army (Navy) at sea in the wake of China’s aggressive posturing on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the message “has gone across to them very unambiguously not to mess with us either at sea or on land”, Vice Admiral Anil Kumar Chawla, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Southern Naval Command, has revealed. “In response to what happened on the northern border, the Navy did portray its deterrent capability at sea. The Navy is a silent service... and once you sail over the horizon nobody knows what happens, except those who have communication systems on the ships. The Navy did play a very important role in deterring the PLA (Navy) at that time and the message has gone across to them very unambiguously that they cannot mess with us either at sea or, for that matter, on land,” the Vice Admiral said in response to a question during a media interaction on board training ship INS Shardul on Wednesday. Vice Admiral Chawla added that the Chinese aggression has given impetus to the ongoing plans of the Indian Navy to build on its strengths, operational capabilities, force levels, partnerships, human resource, and intelligence. Earlier, he said since India had friendly ties with all countries in the region except two, the Indian Navy has been collaborating and cooperating with these navies operating in the region. “They welcome our strengths and indeed see us as a predominant force in the region,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indian-navy-kept-chinese-navy-under-check-vice-admiral/article33236252.ece

Stressing on the importance of hygiene, chief, UNICEF Hyderabad, Meital Rusdia felt that the need to prioritise WASH for communities has increased exponentially world-wide due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Director General of NIRD&PR Alka Upadhyaya argued that there was a need for massive capacity building effort at PRI level, for which NIRDPR would be happy to join hands with UNICEF and other institutions to build the capacity of PRIs at all levels. The theme of this year’s conclave was “Hygiene Matters” and it brought diverse players, including government, civil society, private sector and academia, under one platform to deliberate on WASH strategies with special emphasis on hygiene in the COVID-19 context.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/wash-in-the-time-of-pandemic/article33236222.ece

There was no response from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to questions on the visit. There has been no top level visit since U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit in February due to COVID-19. Also, with the number of COVID-19 cases in India crossing 9.5 million, there is still no clarity on the Republic Day celebrations next year. The MEA said in a statement on Friday that the two leaders exchanged thoughts about the challenges posed by the pandemic and reviewed the promising cooperation between India and the U.K. in the area of vaccine development and manufacturing. The leaders reiterated their shared desire to impart a quantum jump to the India-U.K. partnership in the post-COVID, post-Brexit era, and agreed that there was tremendous potential for enhancing collaboration in trade and investment, scientific research, mobility of professionals and students, and defence and security. Officials said that with focus on a range of areas, the emphasis between the two countries would be to work out a comprehensive strategic partnership. Defence cooperation, a priority area for the two countries, has seen a lot of activity in the past few years. A mutual defence logistics support agreement is in the advanced stages of being signed, while a defence training Memorandum of Understanding is also in the works. A Defence Technology and Industrial Capability Cooperation MoU was signed in April 2019. The two countries are close to signing a government-to-government agreement on jet engine technology development. In addition, the U.K. government is working on a government-to-government framework for defence deals in future. The U.K. has already announced its intent to deploy a Liaison Officer at the Indian Navy’s Information Fusion Centre for Indian Ocean Region meant to improve Maritime Domain Awareness. The U.K. has also made a pitch to India for joint technology development of sixth generation fighter technologies which can go into India’s fifth generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft as well as offered design of its Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier for the Indian Navy’s proposed second indigenous carrier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/boris-johnson-invited-as-chief-guest-for-r-day/article33235583.ece

The exams will be conducted following all COVID-19 protocols.” The statement added that “in case students are not able to do practicals in classes before the exams, alternatives to practical exams will have to be explored”. Schools across the country shut down in March due to the pandemic. The board exams for 2019-2020 were partially completed when the lockdown happened. After multiple postponements and court cases, the remaining papers were cancelled, and grades calculated through a court-approved formula. Unable to go to school during this academic year, students have been forced to rely on distance education instead, ranging from Zoom classes and television lectures to WhatsApp lessons and self-study. The syllabus for the Class 10 and 12 board examinations was reduced by 30% to ease the burden on students. Although the Centre gave permission for schools to re-open from mid-October while following safety measures, few States have taken the decision to allow students to return to physical classes. Although some parents and students have demanded online examinations due to fears of infection, the CBSE has decided that online mode would not be possible for all students, and the examination will be held in physical examination halls instead.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/2021-board-exams-will-be-in-written-mode-cbse/article33235585.ece

Both the U.S. and the European Union’s regulator are sifting through the same Pfizer vaccine trial data, but have not yet given their approval. Britain’s breakneck speed drew criticism from Brussels where, in an unusually blunt statement, the EU’s drugs regulator said its longer procedure was more appropriate as it was based on more evidence and required more checks.

03 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||NEP upholds quota norms, says Minister||The National Education Policy (NEP) upholds the reservation policy enshrined in the Constitution, Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said on Tuesday, rebutting an allegation that the NEP 2020 seeks to end reservation for the disadvantaged groups. Last week, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking for a “clear and categorical” response on whether the NEP intended to end the reservation policy. He said there was no mention of the word “reservation” in the NEP. There is no intention to dilute the provisions of reservation in the country’s educational institutions, Mr. Nishank said in an official statement issued in response to Mr. Yechury’s letter. “The policy affirms the constitutional mandate of reservation enshrined in Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution. I think it does not need any further reiteration of provisions of reservation in the NEP-2020 which is already working within the framework of the Constitution,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nep-upholds-quota-norms-says-minister/article33235609.ece

03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Farmers demand special session of Parliament||The Centre is only willing to consider more limited revisions of the laws. Senior sources in the BJP told The Hindu that while providing a legal safeguard for minimum support prices or writing it into the law is not something that the government wants to do, adequate safeguards within the Agricultural Produce Market Committee structure could be considered. “Even though there have been complaints from farmers themselves that there have been cases of exploitation within the APMC structure, further safeguards can be added as per what the farmers want,” said a senior leader. The second demand that could be looked into is the grievance redress mechanism under the new laws which makes the district administration very powerful, said the source. The protesters are widening their scope and their allies. The All-India Motor Transport Congress, the apex truckers’ body, will go on a strike in north India from December 8 in support of the farmers’ agitation, said its president Kultaran Singh Atwal. He told The Hindu that the strike would spread to the whole country, if the Centre failed to heed the farmers’ demands. The Bharatiya Kisan Union-Tikait group, which has been blocking highways in Uttar Pradesh in a separate protest, and had a separate meeting with Cabinet Ministers on Wednesday, has also joined hands with the wider movement for now. “The Centre has been trying to divide the farmers’ movement by negotiating separately with different groups. This is not only a struggle of the Punjab farmers any more. We are a national movement jointly fighting under the Samyukt Kisan Morcha banner,” said Mr. Pal, urging other farmers’ and social movements to hold solidarity protests. On December 7, sportspersons and ex-servicemen supporting the farmers will return their awards and medals to the Central government. Asserting that large corporates will benefit from the new laws at the expense of farmers, protest leaders called for burning the effigies of industrialists Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani on December 5 in every village, along with the effigies of the Prime Minister.

All elderly in institutionalised care should be tested using RT-PCR every three months. Any one in this category with influenza-like symptoms should be tested as soon as they exhibit symptoms.

It referred to the case of Mr. Goswami when a Bench led by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde repeatedly advised it to approach the Allahabad High Court instead of fighting in the Supreme Court. “There have been occasions in the past when the Supreme Court has interfered... In the case of Arnab Goswami, this court interfered even when his bail application was pending in the lower court... We will rely on that,” senior advocate Kapil Sibal, for the KUWJ, submitted. “Every case is different,” Chief Justice Bobde replied. The court further questioned the capacity of the KUWJ to “agitate the rights of an accused” charged with the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. “Show us any precedent where an association can agitate the rights of an accused... This is a criminal matter,” Chief Justice Bobde said to Mr. Sibal. The journalists’ union said it would overcome this ‘technical’ hitch by impleading the wife or daughter of Mr. Kappan in the plea.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kappan-case-journalists-union-cites-arnab-case/article33235592.ece
03 December 2020||New Delhi,||Farmers’ incomes have halved: Rahul||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said that instead of doubling farmers’ income, as claimed by the Narendra Modi government, their income had been “halved”, while the income of the “crony friends of the government” had grown four times. Mr. Gandhi reiterated the Congress’s demand that the three farm laws be abolished at the earliest. He called the ongoing talks between farmers’ groups and the government a farce. “They [the government] said farmers’ income will be doubled. What they did was increase the income of [their] ‘friends’ four times. This is a government of suit-boot, lies and loot,” the Congress leader said in a tweet in Hindi. The party’s communication in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala questioned the talks, asking that if the PM had asserted that the laws were right, “then what are the talks about?” Constitutionally, too, the three laws were faulty, he said, since agriculture was a State subject.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-incomes-have-halved-rahul/article33235595.ece

Saini flags threat of bioweapons||While countries are struggling to rein in the virus, “certain countries” have seized the opportunity to extend their influence militarily, economically and politically, which does not augur well for the world community, said Vice Chief of the Army Staff Lieutenant General S.K. Saini on Wednesday. Virtually addressing participants at the ‘National Defence Course Bangladesh on post COVID-19 security challenges’, he said that “future wars may gravitate towards zero cost wars, wherein a very virulent pathogen may immobilise high-technology arsenal”. He said that “weaker militaries will continue to seek an asymmetric advantage in an unrestricted warfare milieu” while “social media will continue to be the vector of choice for the battle of narratives”. On the impact of the pandemic, Lt. Gen. Saini said that strategic security of most nations has been impacted due to reduction in funds for military capabilities and projects, since vast sums of money have been diverted for urgent health requirements. “Many countries fuelled by ultra-nationalism are experiencing accelerated process of de-globalisation leading to closing of borders for movement of goods, people, services and even ideas,” he remarked on the trend of “de-globalisation”. Talking of the impact of COVID-19 on the military, Lt. Gen. Saini said “force sustainment is a challenge due to delays in delivery schedules owing to production halts and workforce disruptions” and called for “technology-enabled solutions for integrated identification, control and management of such threats”. He emphasised that “militaries of the region must evolve a defence cooperation plan since they will become the first responders during such health disasters”. Lt. Gen. Saini had attended the National Defence College Bangladesh in 2011.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/viruses-could-be-used-as-bioweapons/article33235612.ece

Ms. Ramamurthy, who was elected to the post by securing 95% of the 2,500 votes in the election held in 2019, said expectations of the people were huge. Many of them were out of the purview of the panchayat president. Hence, she tendered her resignation. “People approach me for each and everything right from seeking employment under the rural job scheme to getting old age pension and free house sites. They cannot be blamed. But the atmosphere is not conducive to fulfilling their expectations. I have no other option but to resign the post,” she told The Hindu.  Ms. Ramamurthy said there were about 1,250 families in the village. They had varied expectations. There were about 500 unemployed youth. Many of them became jobless after the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of them expected her to come to their rescue in some way. Asked whether she faced non-cooperation from authorities, she replied in the negative but added that the scope of a panchayat president was limited.

03 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Koyambedu flower market to reopen on December 14||After nearly seven months, the Koyambedu flower market will be reopened on December 14. This is the last section of shops waiting to be reopened at the market complex. The wholesale market was closed in May after it turned into a COVID-19 cluster. The flower market began functioning from a four-acre site in Vanagaram sans basic amenities. Business was also carried out in other places of the city for several months. About 600 shops that are functioning in various places are set to shift to Koyambedu soon. On Wednesday, members of the Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sankangalin Peramaippu and the Federation of All Traders’ Associations of Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex met Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority member-secretary Shunchonngam Jatak Chiru on the issue. Merchants said various sections of the market had been reopened in four phases so far. The market now received about 40,000-50,000 retailers daily and customers were not allowed on the premises. Meanwhile, vegetable wholesalers said prices of most vegetables had stabilised after the remaining semi-wholesalers reopened 700 shops on November 29. S. Chandran, Koyambedu Periyar Wholesale Market Licensed Merchants Association, said, “Wholesale business has picked up by 20%-30% after semi-wholesalers shifted to Koyambedu. We are able to manage crowds in the market as 90% of the encroachments have been controlled. The Market Management Committee authorities conduct periodical checks.” Wholesale price of most vegetables had dropped by 50% over the past few days, except potatoes, onions, tomatoes and carrots. D. Rajasekaran, president, Federation of All Traders’ Associations of Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex, said the price of onions had dropped to Rs. 30-Rs. 40 a kg. Retailers did not prefer Egyptian onions anymore as local onions were available at almost the same price. While carrots were sold for Rs. 55 a kg in the wholesale market on Wednesday, the price had dropped by almost half now. Heavy rain in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka had led to the price hike. Similarly, potatoes were sold at Rs. 35 a kg and tomatoes Rs. 25 a kg in the wholesale market due to shortage of produce. “As the yields are better, we expect the cost of most vegetables to dip further. Broad beans and capsicum are being sold for Rs. 20 a kg. Even those priced over Rs. 30 may sell for a lower price by January,” said Mr. Rajasekaran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/koyambedu-flower-market-to-reopen-on-december-14/article33236164.ece
03 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC judge lauds 7.5% horizontal quota||Justice N. Anand Venkatesh of the Madras High Court on Wednesday lauded the enactment of the Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Courses in Medicine, Dentistry, Indian Medicine and Homeopathy on preferential basis to students of Government Schools Act, 2020. The judge told Advocate-General (A-G) Vijay Narayan that the 7.5% horizontal reservation for government school students in medical college admissions was “the greatest” thing to have happened in the State in a long time. “This will be a turning point for government school students and will change their family status altogether,” he said. The observations were made while hearing petitions filed by the parents of students R. Dharshini and A. Elakkiya of Cuddalore district. Senior Counsel P. Wilson said the students had been offered seats under the 7.5% quota in private colleges, but were kept in the waiting list because they were apprehensive of paying the fees. Entire expenditure However, the A-G told the court that the government had now decided to bear the entire expenditure to be incurred for educating all students admitted under the 7.5% quota, even if they get allotted to private colleges. “These students need not pay even a single paisa. Even their food will be sponsored by the State,” he said. At the time of counselling, a government order to this effect had not been issued. However, the officials gave an oral assurance to the students that the government would bear the expenditure. “About 95% of the students accepted the oral assurance, obtained the allotment letters and joined the colleges allotted to them,” the A-G said. However, a small section of students did not join private colleges despite accepting the allotment letters as they feared that they would not be able to pay the fees. “We will revalidate the allotment letters of these students and make sure that they join the colleges. There was a third category of students who did not accept the allotment letters at all,” he added. “The present petitioners fall under the third category. We are trying our best to accommodate this category also after the return of unfilled seats to the State government from the all-India quota. Every year, the Centre returns 100 to 150 seats to the State government. Apart from that, some private colleges also surrender their seats to the government quota,” he said. “After these seats are returned, the 7.5% quota would be applied to them, too,” the A-G assured the court. The judge recorded his submission and adjourned the two writ petitions for December 11, since it was represented to the court that the number of unfilled seats under the all-India quota would be made known by the Director General of Health Services by December 8.

Sources in the Tamil Nadu Road Development Company (TNRDC) said that 25 of these trees were planted by them 14 years ago, and the others were on the road before it was widened.

We have planted hundreds of trees wherever we have space,” said an official. The trees would be shifted inside the Central Polytechnic campus and nurtured for nine months. “The work has been contracted out for Rs. 3.2 lakh. We have already pruned additional branches and leaves so that the weight would not be much when they are shifted. The process of replantation is expected to be completed in 15 days,” said an engineer who is associated with the project. S.

According to police, Gautam Karthik, 31, a resident of Kasturi Rangan Road, was cycling on T.T.K. Road around 5.10 a.m. on Wednesday. Two men on a bike came from behind, snatched his mobile phone and sped away. He lodged a complaint with the police around 5.30 a.m. A case has been registered and further investigation is on. City cyclists said they had been facing this problem for the past many years and despite complaints to the police, nothing had been done. “We get two or three complaints every month, primarily from people who cycle through the T.T.K Road-Cathedral Road junction and near City Centre. We don’t get too many complaints from other parts of the city,” said Akilesh Chalani, organiser, We are Chennai Cycling Group (WCCG). Mr. Chalani said cyclists had observed that the culprits would usually be a duo on a bike. “They not only snatch the phone, but also push the cyclist down. We have already complained to the police,” he said.

Students of the final-year postgraduate science programmes were allowed on campus. It was a fulfilling experience for teachers to have students back. However, at many colleges, students hailing from outside the city did not return. New College principal Basheer Ahamed said that in certain departments, all students came to class. He hoped the others would return in due course. All staff members were present. “People are very happy because we cannot stay at home forever. We will become lethargic. All staff members and students are happy to come. Physical classes are more effective than online classes. When you engage a class, we cannot express the amount of happiness thus derived,” he said. Queen Mary’s College principal B. Uma Maheshwari said 70%-80% students were present. The rest were expected to be present from Thursday. “We have only one student for a work table. It was nice to see the students. The campus is alive. We have to instruct the students to follow the Standard Operating Procedure. Since they are coming to the college after a long time, they tend to group together. When they move out of the classroom, we have to monitor them. I have asked the physical directors to prevent grouping,” she said. The college will begin the semester examination from Thursday. It would be held online, she said. The head of a department at an aided autonomous college said that though the classes had started, there were not enough teachers to monitor the online as well as physical classes. “We have not received any guidelines on how to conduct classes. We cannot provide Internet connectivity to all on the campus. We have to teach the junior classes, which are online too. How can we attend to both activities?” he asked.

There are many women who play the nagaswaram . But only a few have been able to break the mould and pursue a career as a  professional thavil player. M. Sarojini, a thavil player from Vriddhachalam in Cuddalore district, is one among them. Devotees at the Viruthagireeswarar temple know her well as she is a musician of the temple. “My family had reservations when I showed interest in learning the instrument. They felt that the thavil was a tough instrument and not suitable for a woman. But I decided to go ahead,” said Ms. Sarojini. She learnt the instrument when she was studying in Class 5. Learning the instrument was easy for her as she belonged to a family of nagaswaram and thavil players. All in the family Her father Chinna Pillai, a nagaswaram player, and her brother Gurumurthy, a thavil player, are attached to the Viruthagireeswarar temple in Vriddhachalam. The family has its roots in Thanjavur, but migrated to Vriddhachalam 30 years ago. “As a temple musician, I play four times a day in the temple when the pujas are conducted. I accompany my father. I also perform outside at concerts but mostly with my family members, who are musicians,” said Ms. Sarojini. The thavil player had to take a break from playing the instrument when her son was born. But she soon resumed playing and became a part of Nada Sangamam, a troupe that comprises an amalgamation of various instrument players. They play classical and film songs at different functions and weddings. “Our troupe has performed in various places, including in Chennai. I am keen on improving my career as a performing artiste,” added Ms. Sarojini.  My family had reservations when I showed interest in learning the instrument. They felt that the thavil was a tough instrument and was not suitable for a woman. But I decided to go ahead||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/the-female-thavil-player-breaking-the-mould/article33236177.ece

03 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||108 ambulance service out of RTI ambit||The Tamil Nadu Information Commission has ruled that the GVK Emergency Management & Research Institute (EMRI) that provides ‘108’ ambulance services in the State is a private entity and is not covered under the Right to Information Act, 2005. Passing orders on two different petitions that sought information on the number of ‘108’ ambulances, its facilities and manpower operated by GVK EMRI, State Information Commissioner S. Selvaraj who perused documents of both parties said he was satisfied that the organisaation was a private concern and did not fall under the ambit of a public authority under the RTI Act. In his petition, S. Anburaj of Usilampatti, Madurai, wrote to GVK EMRI seeking to know their role and responsibilities in the operation of 108 ambulance services in the State. He wanted to know the quantum of professional tax deducted from the employees attached to the service and where the same was remitted. Another petitioner P. Baskar of Vilangudi in Madurai district had petitioned under the Act calling for district-wise details of ‘108’ ambulances. Among the 16 questions that he raised also included a query as to whether GVK EMRI was a service organisation. Not satisfied with the reply of the Public Information Officer and the First Appellate Authority, the petitioners moved the Commission. In both the cases, the Public Information Officer who appeared in the online (video) enquiry being held in view of the pandemic stated that GVK EMRI was a private organisation that was offering 108 emergency ambulance services on the basis of a memorandum of understanding. The petitioners should approach the Tamil Nadu Health and Family Welfare Department for further details, the PIO said. Mr. Selvaraj closed both petitions saying that there was no need for further enquiry after accepting the arguments and documents put forth by the service provider. GVK EMRI says in its website that it is the largest emergency service provider in the country and a not-for-profit professional organisation operating in a public-private partnership (PPP) mode.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/108-ambulance-service-is-not-covered-under-rti-act/article33236150.ece
03 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Give DVAC’s inquiry report against Minister to complainants, HC tells government||The Madras High Court on Wednesday wanted to know why the complainants against Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani should not be given a copy of the preliminary inquiry report submitted by Director of Vigilance and Anti Corruption (DVAC) giving a clean chit to him. Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha were of the view that there would not be any impediment to sharing the preliminary inquiry report since it had become a public document after its acceptance by the State government which had dropped all further proceedings. The judges said a copy of the report could be given to Jayaraman Venkatesan of Arappor Iyakkam and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Member of Parliament R.S. Bharathi who had lodged complaints regarding large scale corruption in award of contracts by Greater Chennai and Coimbatore Corporations. They granted time till December 9 for the Advocate General to obtain instructions in this regard from the government. The Bench said the two complainants would be able to pursue further legal proceedings on the issue if they were armed with the DVAC's preliminary inquiry report. Justice Sathyanarayanan pointed out that only the case details could not be disclosed until completion of inquiry because it might hinder the probe. However, there was no bar on disclosing the details after the inquiry had been completed. Therefore, the report could be shared with the complainants, he said. The Bench had, last year, appointed Superintendent of Police R. Ponni of the DVAC to conduct the preliminary inquiry. Accordingly, the officer conducted a detailed probe and filed a report to DVAC Director Vijay Kumar on December 18, 2019 stating that no case had been made out for registration of a First Information Report against the Minister and Corporation officials. The inquiry report was approved by the Director and forwarded to the Vigilance Commissioner on January 13 this year. The Vigilance Commissioner, too, endorsed the report on January 18 and moved it to the government, which accepted the report on January 22 and dropped all further proceedings on the complaints lodged against the Minister. Refusing to accept the report, senior counsel N.R. Elango and advocate V. Suresh, representing the complainants, said the DVAC had conducted a full-fledged investigation in the guise of conducting a preliminary inquiry. They said such a course was impermissible under law and that the matter could be investigated only after registering a FIR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/give-dvacs-inquiry-report-against-minister-to-complainants-hc-tells-government/article33236199.ece
03 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||2 chain snatchers escape from police custody||Two of three chain-snatching suspects reportedly escaped from police custody near Perambur on Wednesday while being taken to the jewellery shop where they had sold a chain. According to police, on Tuesday, Rathinakumar, 60, a resident of B.B. Garden in Perambur, and his wife Subashini, 54, were walking near their house in the morning when three men on a bike snatched Ms. Subashini’s chain and sped away. Based on her complaint, the Sembium police registered a case and nabbed three suspects the same night with the help of CCTV footage. The names of the arrested were given as Ajit Kumar and Rajesh of Vyasarpadi and Akash of Pulianthope. They told the police that they had sold the chain at a jewellery outlet in Pulianthope, and the three were taken there to recover it. After they identified the shop, the policemen asked them to get down from the vehicle and started walking towards it. Suddenly, Ajit and Akash pushed the police and fled the spot. The personnel managed to restrain Rajesh and took him back to the station. The police have launched a search for Ajit and Akash.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/2-chain-snatchers-escape-from-police-custody/article33236157.ece
03 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. not experiencing more cyclones now than before||With the Tamil Nadu coast bearing the impact of Cyclone Burevi within days of having been battered by Cyclone Nivar, the question that many ask is whether the State has been experiencing more tropical cyclones in recent years than in the past. A firm ‘no’ is the response from veteran meteorologists Y.E.A. Raj and S. Balachandran. They say occurrences in a year or two should not be construed as a trend. Instead, the data for at least 10 years should be taken into account. Average figure Pointing out that the State on an average gets one cyclonic system or disturbance annually, Dr. Raj, former Deputy Director-General of Meteorology (DDGM), explains that going by the data for the period from 1965 to 2019, the average number of systems that affected the Bay of Bengal region during October-December was 3.6 a year. In other words, there were 198 weather systems in total. Apart from Tamil Nadu, the region includes Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal, and the neighbouring countries of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Different stages The term, ‘cyclonic system or disturbance’, covers different stages — depression, deep depression, cyclonic storm, severe cyclonic storm, very severe cyclonic storm, extremely severe cyclonic storm and super cyclonic storm, which are all graded on the basis of associated maximum wind speed. There has not been any perceptible rise in the number of cyclonic systems that crossed the Tamil Nadu coast. This is evident from the fact that 39 systems had hit the State in the 54-year period (1965-2019), Dr. Raj says, adding that the use of satellites for weather forecasting started in the mid-1960s. Factors at play There were years when the Tamil Nadu coast did not have even a single severe cyclonic storm, as had happened during 2001-10. But the State did record heavy rainfall in the period. For example, in 2005, when Tamil Nadu had bountiful rainfall, it was Andhra Pradesh that bore the brunt of the systems, he says. Dr. Balachandran, the present DDGM, says the recent data reveal that it is the Arabian Sea region that experiences the increase in the number of systems. This can be attributed to factors such as warming of the sea and reduction in vertical wind shear, which is characterised by changes in the speed or the direction, or in both. The coastal belt between Tiruvallur and Pudukottai is hit by more number of cyclones than the region south of Pudukottai. Among the reasons is Sri Lanka acting as a shield for the southern belt. In this context, the official recalls that Cyclone Ockhi, which devastated Kanniyakumari three years ago, was one of the four systems that have crossed the place in the last 100 years.  There were years when the State’s coast did not see even a single severe cyclonic storm, as had happened during 2001-10||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-not-experiencing-more-cyclones-now-than-before/article33235705.ece
03 December 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A question of susceptibility: why cases did not soar after Deepavali||Why did the anticipated rise in COVID-19 cases post the over-crowding witnessed during Deepavali not happen? Epidemiologists and virologists advance a few theories that together may explain the drop in the number since then. In the 18 days between November 14 (Deepavali day) and December 1, there were 28,859 new cases in Tamil Nadu. In contrast, in the 18 days between October 27 and November 13, there were 42,747 cases. This fall has overjoyed, and yet foxed, health managers. Jacob John, former professor and HOD, Clinical Virology Department, CMC Hospital, Vellore, says what has shifted is essentially the equation between the susceptible (likely or liable to be infected) people and the non-susceptible people, with the latter increasing. Owing to this, the speed with which the virus can travel has markedly reduced, he adds. He further explains: If one person infected earlier could transmit the infection to four people, and now, if three of them are not susceptible to the infection, only one out of the four will be infected. It is possible then that the trend would be downwards, slowing down post festival, he adds. Second wave possible? Is a second wave a possibility in Tamil Nadu? He says: The second wave is a reality in Italy, Germany, South Korea, New Zealand, or Kerala, wherever the first wave was successfully flattened, and the infection was not allowed to reach a natural peak. So more people remained susceptible in the community. In the course of the epidemic, in June, there was a mutation that made the virus more transmissible. The proportion of the susceptible people versus the non-susceptible people was higher in these places because the infection was suppressed in the first wave. The second wave was stronger, therefore, in these places. “In India, however, we let the virus [have a] free passage... So it possibly wasn’t flattened during the first phase. My hunch is that we may not have a second wave, but we’ll need to wait and watch how this phase proceeds.” The fall in the number of deaths, also witnessed in Tamil Nadu, seems to be part of a universal phenomenon, Dr. John says. Three scenarios are possible. First, those who are at risk have already died of the infection and the remaining are less prone to the infection, and secondly, doctors have learnt to manage the disease better. “The third possibility is that there is a reduction in viral virulence. This is a theoretical possibility though, and is difficult to study,” he says. Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar says slowly lifting the restrictions during the lockdown and using the tapering-off method have had a positive impact. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan says there should be no let-up in vigilance. Following the protocol — masking, physical distance and hand hygiene — should be emphasised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-question-of-susceptibility-why-cases-did-not-soar-after-deepavali/article33235698.ece

Called InstaMask, the first machine, has been installed at the Chennai Moffusil Bus Terminus (CMBT). “The dispensing system works based on a motor operated rotary dispensing mechanism with flexible rollers, which provides unlimited dispensing capacity with minimal foot space and also ensures touch free delivery,” said Krishnna Priyadarshini Elanchezhian, co-founder of the startup. “Also, products are stored in the form of cartridge, which requires zero down time for restocking,” she said. Her co-founder Vijayaragavan Visuvamithiran pointed out that this could be made as an IoT-enabled machine with features such as cashless payment and real time remote monitoring to reduce the cost of maintenance and service. The duo said a pilot study with InstaMask was done at one of the multi-speciality hospitals, post which public feedback was taken. Only after that the product was launched. Ten more machines are in the pipeline and the priority would be to install them at public places like railway stations, airports, metro rail stations, markets, and religious places. They said they had capacity to make 50 machines a month. Each machine can store 500 masks. A provisional patent has been filed for the product by the startup.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-startup-makes-mask-vending-machine/article33236156.ece

We want to get suggestions on what we can do after the COVID-19 situation improves,” Mr. Lee said. “Now is the time for both the Consulate as well as the travel agencies to start a joint campaign to explore tourism relations between Korea and south India,” he said. Travel firms requested a waiver of visa fees and 50% discount in Korean hotels and resorts, among other things. There were also suggestions that the number of days one has to stay under quarantine, on arrival in Korea, be cut down. Currently, people landing in Korea have to remain under mandatory quarantine for 14 days. Last year, around 15,000 visas were issued by the Consulate. Mr. Lee said that Korean families that left India, at the beginning of the pandemic, were now returning. “Over 1,500 people went back to Korea, and now they are all coming back. More than 500 of them have returned to India. For them, India is home,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/south-korean-envoy-holds-meeting-with-tour-operators/article33236160.ece

Justice N. Anand Venkatesh directed Advocate General Vijay Narayan to ascertain the stand of the university since a final year student had approached the court for conducting the examinations. The judge also suo motu included the Bar Council of India (BCI) as one of the respondents to the case since the petitioner had claimed that the council had asked law universities to conduct the arrear exams for final year students through online mode. In his affidavit, the litigant stated that he had joined the 2015-2020 batch of five-year integrated law course in the university’s School of Excellence in Law in Chennai. He took the final semester examinations conducted between September 23 and 29 and cleared all the papers. He and other students in the final year were expecting the arrear examinations also to be conducted along with the final semester but it did not happen, the petitioner said. He stated that the BCI had permitted universities to conduct arrear examinations through online mode or award marks on the basis of project reports. However, the law university was yet to follow either of the two modes and had left the students in the lurch, he complained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/spell-out-decision-on-arrear-exams-hc-tells-law-varsity/article33236170.ece

With several changes taking over education which has rapidly moved online, the focus is on ensuring that students with disabilities are able to continue learning. “Since we work with students who are hearing-impaired and are largely from the underprivileged sections, our main priority is to ensure access and continuity of learning,” said Sr. M. Jesintha Rosalind, principal, Little Flower Convent Higher Secondary School for the Deaf. The school’s special educators have been sending out PowerPoint presentations and video resources, as well as customised recorded lessons, to the students of the higher classes. Earlier this year, the State government’s Kalvi TV started telecasting classes in the sign language to help the hearing-impaired students. For the visually impaired students, WhatsApp voice calls and recordings have been used extensively by their teachers. Jacqueline Latha, principal, Government Higher Secondary School for the Visually Impaired, Poonamallee, said that to the students of Classes 9-12, voice notes, along with video resources that they could listen to, were being sent. “I, however, miss the classroom environment. In school, we picked up concepts quicker and had the option of discussing lessons with our peers, which we don’t have now,” said B. Vijayabalan, a Class 12 student. B. Radhakrishnan, managing trustee, Annai Special School, run by Karunaii Trust, pointed out that families that had children with intellectual disabilities had several challenges, especially with regard to children losing out on a structured daily routine and access to therapeutic services. The one welcome aspect, special educators like B. Malathi say, is the increased involvement of parents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/special-educators-run-into-challenges-as-learning-moves-online/article33236176.ece

Ramadoss had announced protests from December 1, demanding 20% separate reservation for the Vanniyars in education and employment in Tamil Nadu. Traffic on GST Road in the southern suburbs was paralysed for hours on Tuesday morning as PMK workers blocked the road near Perungalathur when the police prevented them from entering the city for staging a demonstration. The Chennai city police registered a case against Dr. Anbumani and other leaders under the Indian Penal Code and the Epidemic Diseases Act. Later in the day, Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss addressed the workers on Anna Salai and met Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam and senior Ministers at the Secretariat. ‘Anbumani absconding’ The police have mentioned Dr. Anbumani as absconding in the case filed for Tuesday’s protests.

03 December 2020||Dindigul,TAMIL NADU||Man kidnapped: police rescue victim, arrest two||Two persons were arrested for the kidnapping a real estate agent under Ammayanayakanoor police limits. Following a complaint from Ravi, that his brother Ganesan (54) of Kalpakkam Chennai was kidnapped by an armed gang on November 25, the police registered a case the following day. According to the complainant, Ganesan received a call from a person seeking to discuss a real estate business proposal. The caller had asked him to come to a location near Ammayanayakanoor on November 25. On reaching the specified location, the gang kidnapped him in his own car to an undisclosed destination. On November 26, Ganesan’s staff, Renuga, received a call asking her to get Rs. 10 lakh as ransom for releasing him. Apprehending trouble, the staff informed Ravi, who lodged a complaint with the police on November 27. Superintendent of Police Ravali Priya formed special teams comprising DSP Murugan, Inspectors Bastiyan and Lavanya, SI Kanna Gandhi and others. Even as the teams were tracking the mobile number of the victim, a caller identifying himself as one of the kidnappers demanded Rs. 40 lakh to set him free. They threatened dire consequences, if the police were informed about it. On November 28, when the kidnappers came to the Ring Road in Madurai, the team, which was hiding, nabbed the two accused, as they received the cash. The names of the accused were given as Marudamalai Mannan (22), a college student from Madurai and Arun (21) of Sivaganga district, an engineer. One of the brains behind the kidnap was said to be a habitual offender. Seeing that two of their accomplices had been arrested, a gang member called the police asking them to immediately set their accomplices free and failing which, the caller threatened to eliminate Ganesan. However, in a swift move, when the police informed that they had already secured the family members of the gang, they reportedly set Ganesan free near Erode district on the night of November 29 and vanished. Further investigations are on. The SP and the DIG of Police M. S. Muthusamy commended the special team. Inspector General of Police (south zone) S. Murugan also appreciated the Dindigul police for the coordinated efforts and rewarded the team Rs. 10,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-kidnapped-police-rescue-victim-arrest-two/article33235712.ece

03 December 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Traffic diversion in Madurai following snarls on P.T.R. Bridge||Madurai City Traffic Police have introduced traffic regulations and a diversion at Teppakulam junction following chock-a-block traffic on P.T.R. Bridge at Anna Nagar last week. The traffic jam on the bridge was the direct effect of the police closing the temporary road laid across the Vaigai in lieu of Kuruvikkaran Salai Bridge, where an elevated bridge is coming up, due to heavy water flow in the river. “It took at least 30 minutes for vehicles to cross the bridge from Anna Nagar to Teppakulam,” said B. Suresh, a resident of Gomathipuram. The jam was caused as all the vehicles were diverted from Kuruvikkaran Salai to PTR Bridge. The traffic signal near the bridge at Teppakulam added to the chaos. “Even ambulances that were rushing towards Anna Nagar were caught in the traffic jam,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police K. Sugumaran. As traffic was chaotic, the police had to stop the traffic signal at Teppakulam junction where vehicles from all three roads – Kamarajar Salai, PTR Bridge and Ramanathapuram Road – join. Consequently, the police blocked the flow of traffic from Kamarajar Salai towards the junction and diverted it around Teppakulam. Vehicles proceeding towards Anna Nagar have been allowed to go through the PTR Bridge, and those proceeding towards Ring Road have been diverted through Cement Road. The junction has been barricaded to prevent vehicles from Anna Nagar from taking a right turn to Kamarajar Salai. Instead, the vehicles must go up to Marudhu Brothers statue junction and take a U-turn towards Kamarajar Salai. No change has been made for vehicles coming from Ramanathapuram Road. “This arrangement is working nicely,” said a driver of a city bus. Traffic on the widened South Bank Road connecting PTR Bridge has been blocked. “This is because a right turn from the Anna Nagar side to the South Bank Road was blocking free flow of traffic,” Assistant Commissioner of Police (Traffic) A. Tirumalaikumar said. The present arrangement will be in force till the completion of the construction of Kuruvikaran Salai Bridge. Officials feel that vehicles can be allowed again on the temporary causeway if its stability is ensured after water flow stops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/traffic-diversion-in-madurai-following-snarls-on-ptr-bridge/article33236269.ece

03 December 2020||METTUPALAYAM,TAMIL NADU||Police restrict first anniversary of wall collapse to a low key affair||The first anniversary of the wall collapse that killed 17 residents of A.D. Colony at Nadur near Mettupalayam in Coimbatore district remained a low key affair on Wednesday as the police imposed various restrictions on the observance. Residents of the colony and the relatives of those who died in the wall collapse in the early hours of December 2 last year told media persons that they were warned by the police against placing flex boards with photographs of the deceased and gathering at the spot of the tragedy. Around 550 police personnel prevented the entry of outsiders into the colony, claiming that they had intelligence inputs that various organisations were attempting to make use of the anniversary as a platform for ideological and political gains. A few families who had lost their kin in the wall collapse said they were asked by the police to pay respects to the departed by placing flowers on the rubble of the collapsed wall individually in the early hours of the day. The collapsed wall was situated on the land belonging to S. Sivasubramaniam, owner of a textile showroom at Mettupalayam. A new wall has come up in its place, which, according to the police, was built with all requisite permission. Ara. Arularasu, Superintendent of Police, Coimbatore District (Rural) Police, said the police had arrested Subramaniam under the right provisions of the law in connection with the tragedy. “Now the matter is under the purview of the court. Also, the police have nothing to do with the new wall constructed in place of the fallen wall. We understand that the land owner could have obtained all the required permission before its construction,” said Mr. Arularasu. According to the police, the new or old wall could not be called as a 'wall of discrimination', as claimed by many organisations and a few political parties, because the old or the new structure did not block a public pathway or restrict movement of people belonging to SC/ST community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-restrict-first-anniversary-of-wall-collapse-to-a-low-key-affair/article33235731.ece

Colony at Nadur near Mettupalayam on Wednesday as she recalled the dreadful morning of December 2, 2019. Seven persons from her close-knit family were killed when a weak compound wall separating the colony from the property of a textile showroom owner collapsed on a few thatched houses in the early hours of the day. Kamalammal’s son Anandh Kumar (40), his wife Nathiya (30) their children Akshaya (7) and Loguram (7); her another son’s wife Arukkani (50), children Harisudha (16) and Mahalakshmi (10) were killed in the wall collapse. “I was off to my eldest daughter Marathal’s house in Tiruppur. We received a call about the incident early in the morning and all of us were shell-shocked” recalled Mr. Kamalammal. According to her, she was granted a single solatium for the death of her son. “I was told by officials that the compensation could be given for the death of my son and not for that of my daughters-in-law or grandchildren. Similarly, authorities told me that suitable jobs could be granted for other surviving members of the family who are now struggling to live. I am also not sure if the Government is prepared to allot a house as promised,” she said. The woman had also petitioned the District Collector seeking allocation of the compensation for the six other deceased from her family. Following the wall collapse, a total sum of Rs. 12 lakh -- Rs. 10 lakh from State and Rs. 2 lakh from the Centre -- was announced as compensation for the victims. The State Government had also promised new houses and suitable jobs. Pratap Kumar, who lost his mother, sister, grandmother and two cousins in the wall collapse, said he was given the job of 'Thandakarar' but he could not take it up as he studied only up to eighth standard. “Now I am going for painting work”, he said. “There is no clarity about the allocation of new houses,” said Mr. Kumar’s paternal uncle A.

Panneerselvam of Social Justice Party said the construction of the new wall was not acceptable. “We have planned to petition the Mettupalayam Municipality and the Town Planning Authority [asking] how the permission was granted for the construction of the new wall within a year of the tragedy”, he said. Demanding the demolition of the new wall, Venmani of Dravidar Tamilar Katchi alleged that the police failed to file the chargesheet in the case on time.

03 December 2020||NEW DELHI,TAMIL NADU||SC rejects Sterlite’s appeal to reopen plant for 30 days||The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a proposal made by Vedanta Sterlite to operate its closed copper plant in Thoothukudi for 30 days under the supervision of an expert committee appointed by the court. The company mooted the idea so that the court could ascertain whether the plant was complying with pollution norms. Vedanta said its plant met 36% of the need for copper in the country and it was not in the public interest to keep it closed. But a Bench led by Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman, in a short order, refused the proposal point-blank. The Tamil Nadu government, represented by senior advocate K.V. Viswanathan and Additional Advocate General Balaji Srinivasan, said the proposal was only a “ruse to open” a plant which had been polluting for over 20 years. Slag was dumped all over Thoothukudi in 11 places. The Madras High Court had ordered its permanent closure and sealing. The plant has been closed since May 2018. The apex court said it would hear the main appeal filed by the company against the HC order later. On Wednesday, senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, for Vedanta, argued that the question whether the plant complied with pollution norms or not could be ascertained by the apex court only if it was allowed to resume operations for 30 days. “The proof of the pudding is in the eating... Can this country afford the closure of a plant which takes care of 36% of the need for copper? It cannot harm public interest,” Mr. Singhvi submitted. Mr. Singhvi said the plant, established in 1995, was upgraded periodically with the best available technology. Its overall asset value was Rs. 3,630 crore. The factory employed 4,000 people directly and another 20,000 indirectly. The closure of the plant has affected the lives of two lakh dependents by virtue of downstream industries. Its contribution to the Central exchequer has been Rs. 2,559 crore. Besides, the plant had contributed to 7% of the traffic to Thoothukudi port. The unit’s closure has resulted in India becoming a net importer of refined copper after 18 years. Senior advocate C.S. Vaidyanathan, appearing for the State pollution authorities, countered that the “trial run” proposal was an “ingenious” way to reopen the factory without arguing the main appeal against the Madras HC’s decision of permanent closure. Mr. Srinivasan submitted that the purported basis of seeking such an “extraordinary prayer” was to enable ascertainment of compliances in 2020, when the plant has been shut down on account of non-compliances and pollution between 2013-2018 and beyond. He said the company, through “deliberate half-truths”, was trying to actually restore the plant and create a fait accompli . “Now, they [Vedanta] want a trial run of 30 days, while earlier they had cried hoarse that operations cannot be started within a short period as the plant was in a state of disrepair,” the Tamil Nadu government countered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/supreme-court-rejects-sterlites-appeal-to-reopen-plant-for-30-days/article33235711.ece

03 December 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||2,000 hectares of cultivated land hit by Cyclone Nivar||An assessment made by the Agriculture Department immediately after the rains following Cyclone Nivar has revealed that around 2,768 hectares of cultivated area has been affected due to inundation and heavy winds. A report submitted by the Department to Minister for Agriculture R. Kamalakannan has estimated the loss of crops to be to the tune of Rs. 17.2 crore. The damage to crops has been restricted to Puducherry district, the report said. In 2,545 hectares of land, damage was more than 33%. Damage to paddy was more intense as water stagnation was reported in crops at the panicle initiation and tillering stage of rice. Paddy crops sustained damage in around 1,663.42 hectares of land. The report said 387 hectares of sugarcane, 203 hectares of vegetable and tubers, 164 hectares of fruits, 62 hectares of fodder, 28 hectares of pulses, 12 hectares of millets, 19 hectares of flowers, 4.03 hectares of groundnut and 2 hectares of betel vine sustained damage in the rain. The maximum damage to paddy was reported in Bahour; banana cultivation in Mannadipet and sugarcane in Katterikuppam areas, Mr. Kamalakannan told The Hindu . The government would soon submit a detailed report to the Centre seeking assistance for farmers under the National Disaster Response Fund. Farmers who have sustained more than 33% crop loss are eligible to obtain financial assistance under the Fund, he said. Assistance to the tune of Rs. 2.73 crore would be sought for small and marginal farmers with less than 2 hectares of land. Funds to the tune of Rs. 70 lakh would be sought for big farmers, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/2000-hectares-of-cultivated-land-hit-by-cyclone-nivar/article33236340.ece
03 December 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘L-G rejecting govt. proposal an abuse of power’||Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Wednesday termed as “irregular” and amounting to “abuse of power” Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi’s decision to shoot down the government’s proposal to withdraw the special excise duty on liquor, which was imposed as a COVID-19 containment measure in May. Addressing a virtual press meet, the Chief Minister said the government had sent the proposal after assessment of an improvement in the COVID situation and to stimulate the revival of the Union Territory’s economy, which was heavily invested on tourism. Hike in licence fee The government proposed to withdraw the 100% COVID tax on liquor and instead impose 15% and double the licence fee to help boost year-end tourism. However, in extending the special duty till January 31, Ms. Bedi had flouted rules and acted in contravention of the Madras High Court ruling that the Lt. Governor did not have special powers to overrule a government decision, Mr. Narayanasamy stated. “The extension of the special duty for two more months will lower sales and revenue to the government. It is regrettable that the Lt. Governor is blocking revenue to the State and this is something that people should realise. This is the latest instance of the Lt. Governor overriding a government decision,” he said. Mr. Narayanasamy also expressed support for the ongoing farmers’ stir demanding the repeal of three agricultural laws. Terming the demands of the farmers for a fair price just, he urged the Centre to immediately repeal the “anti-farmer” Act and resolve the issue. By bringing in these laws, the BJP government had betrayed the farmers and the agitation was gaining solidarity among farmers and political parties in other States as well, he said. The Chief Minister said though he had written to the Prime Minister, the Home Minister and the Finance Minister seeking interim relief of Rs. 100 crore in the wake of the losses suffered from the impact of Cyclone Nivar, there had been no response. Pointing out that it is estimated that the Union Territory’s fishermen, farmers and infrastructure had suffered a loss of at least Rs. 400 crore, he hoped that the Central team, which was expected to arrive to assess losses, would expedite sanction of relief.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/l-g-rejecting-govt-proposal-an-abuse-of-power/article33236338.ece

03 December 2020||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||Project to produce biodiesel from used cooking oil launched||The Food Safety Department’s repurpose used cooking oil (RUCO) project that enables collection of used cooking oil from vendors and food industry to produce biodiesel was launched here. Launched by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India in the country, the project is aimed at purchasing used oils from hoteliers, caterers, snack makers and traders at a reasonable price and converting it into biodiesel at a plant. Officials said that, at present, used cooking oil was dumped in drains, open spaces or reused in snack making units and roadside eateries. Collector S.A. Raman, who launched the project at the Collectorate, said that 1,000 litres of cooking oil was purchased from five food business operators (FBOs) at Rs. 25 a litre and cheques for Rs. 25,000 were handed over to them. He said that FBOs could sell the used oil to the department and receive cheque for the same. Mr Raman distributed containers to purchase cooking oil and flagged off a vehicle to transport the oil.

03 December 2020||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||Hero stones found in Sentharapatti village||Five hero stones with inscriptions dating back to fifth or sixth century were found at Sentharapatti village in Gangavalli Taluk in the district recently. Members of a voluntary organisation ‘ Yaakkai ‘ comprising Kumaravel Ramasamy, Sudhakar, Palanisamy and Arunraja, visited the village and found the stones amid trees. Though the inscriptions were recorded 30 years ago, the full text was not deciphered. During the present re-reading, it is learnt that these inscriptions are an important historical evidence of the indigenous social background that existed in the beginning of the Pallava period (275 CE to 897 CE). During the strengthening of the Pallava rule, the Attur Pass, Sentharapatti, Kollimalai and Pachamalai Pass were dominated by ethnic leaders with separate powers, the members said. Archaeologist Poongundran said that a hero stone began with the name Neelakandaraisar. It was the 33rd reign of Singavinnaparuman, a short-lived king of Attur region, who controlled Poithaneeyaar. He said that these names were used in all the five stones and the archaic transliteration of the Tolkappiyam script could be seen in these inscriptions. The name Neelakandaraisar also appears in the Thondai Mandal inscriptions at different times in different places. It is therefore more likely to be considered a generic name to identify an ethnic group than the name of an individual, Mr. Poongundran added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hero-stones-found-in-sentharapatti-village/article33235738.ece

03 December 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Sloppy UGD works render roads unmotorable||The current spell of monsoon has compounded the woes of residents, who live in areas where the underground drainage works are under way. Roads have been dug up in different parts of the city as part of phase-II and III underground drainage projects. Kattur, Tiruverumbur, Varaganeri, Devadhanam, Golden rock, Ariyamagalam, K.K. Nagar, Mannarpuram, J.K. Nagar, RS Puram, and Airport road are among the areas, where the project works are on. Works have been taking place in some areas of Cantonment and Woraiyur also. There are already numerous complaints that the pits dug up for installing underground drainage chambers and laying pipelines have not been properly closed at various places, causing anxious moments to residents who drive two-wheelers and cars. There are instances of heavy vehicles getting stuck in the deep pits. Also, the wet spells have added to the sufferings of the residents. Almost all roads have become slushy and slippery. It is ultimately troubling the road users. They have to be more careful whenever they pass through the uneven and slushy roads. It is not just that they have become non-motorable. Many residents find it difficult to even walk on the muddy roads. Children and elders, who unable to get grip, often fall on the slippery roads. “We undergo untold sufferings since the start of underground drainage construction work. The woes have manifold since the onset of monsoon. The civic body should have made alternative arrangements to minimise the inconvenience to the residents in the work areas,” says Thirumavalavan, a resident of Kattur in the city. Ensuring the roads motorable is the prime duty of the civic body. It could have asked the contractors to take precautions ahead of the monsoon season. But, it has totally failed to chalk out contingency plan to deal the situation arising out of heavy or steady downpour, he added. It is a tough time for those constructing houses in the areas, where underground drainage works are on as they face trouble in bringing loads of bricks, sands and steel to the work sites. Many of the trucks happen to end up stuck in the improperly closed roads. “Since we are familiar with the roads, we take additional care while negotiating our vehicles on the roads. Vehicles of unwary drivers invariably get trapped in the pits,” said a resident of SBI Officers’ Colony in Cantonment, where UGD works is on.

03 December 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||BDU’s odd semester exam on Dec. 14||Bharathidasan University is all set to commence the odd semester exams of this academic year on December 14, altering an earlier schedule of internal and external exams that was arrived upon due to the lockdown. The earlier plan discussed at the meetings of college principals was to conduct three internal exams for 25 marks each followed by the semester exam for 25 marks. But, so far, the colleges have been able to conduct only two internal exams. And, the second internal exam is still in progress. Due to shortage of time, the semester exam will be conducted during the schedule that was earlier fixed for conduct of the third internal exam. The university intends to complete the semester exam before Christmas. The pattern of distribution of marks for the internal and external exam has also been tweaked by the university. “Now, the external exam will be conducted for 75 marks and the colleges will have the flexibility to factor in any one of the internal exams in which the student has a better score for the internal marks,” Controller of Examinations In-charge Srinivasa Raghavan said. Through teaching in the online mode, four of the five units could be covered in the two internal exams. The final unit will be completed before commencement of the external exam for first, third and fifth semesters of undergraduation and first and third semesters of post-graduation programmes, Mr. Srinivasa Raghavan said. Submission of scripts Another major change in the online examination system this time is that the students can submit the answer scripts at their colleges within a few hours after downloading questions and completing the exam at their homes. Principals are understood to have been instructed by the university to accept the answer scripts through post or email also. The university had to drop the idea of uploading of answer scripts online due to the difficulties that the students in rural parts had to undergo.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bdus-odd-semester-exam-on-dec-14/article33236390.ece

The bank managers have been able to prevail upon people who had to leave their jobs elsewhere and return to their native villages due to the lockdown to start their own ventures and remain where they are. “Most of the applicants in this category have chosen to switch over to self-employment readily,” G.Raveendran, General Manager, District Industries Centre, Tiruchi, said. There are now increasing instances of applicants being sponsored by bank managers for financial assistance under Unemployed Youth Employment Guarantee Scheme and Prime Minister’s Employment Guarantee Scheme to start readymade garment shops, beauty parlour, operate auto rickshaws and other such ventures that require investment of only a few lakhs of rupees. There is also an instance of a well-qualified applicant being sanctioned loan by SBI Branch at Kattuputhur for manufacture of bio-enzyme-enriched cattlefeed, Mr. Raveendran said. ‘On course’ “We are on course to achieving subsidy targets under UYEGP, PMEGP and NEEDS (New Entrepreneur cum Enterprise Development Scheme) notwithstanding the COVID pandemic lockdown,” he said. Under PMEGP, the Industries Department has sanctioned loans to 46 applicants against the target of 53. A sum of Rs. 60 lakh has also been releases as subsidy for 28 applicants. Under UYEGP, subsidy of Rs. 75 lakh has been released to nine applicants. As for NEEDS, the target was to sanction loans to 37 applicants with subsidy component of Rs. 3.63 crore. So far, the department has sanctioned loansto 17 applicants involving subsidy disbursal to the extent of Rs. 1.53 crore. “There are 25 applications pending with the banks under this scheme.

03 December 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Farmers to lay siege to Raj Bhavan||Condemning Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence on the farmers’ protest against the three farm laws in Delhi, the Coordination Committee of All Farmers Associations of Tamil Nadu on Wednesday called for a siege of the Raj Bhavan in Chennai on December 11, to express solidarity with the Delhi protesters. The committee also called upon the ruling AIADMK to withdraw its support to the farm laws and reconsider its alliance with the BJP. Addressing presspersons after a meeting of the committee here, its president, P.R. Pandian, said the Prime Minister was responsible for the farmers’ lives and his continued silence on the protest was highly condemnable. The Prime Minister refused to respect the sentiments of the farmers, whose protest was keenly being watched by world leaders, he said. Instead, the Centre was condemning Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for extending moral support to the protesting farmers, Mr. Pandian said. He called upon the Prime Minister to immediately invite the farmers for talks and repeal the legislation. Contending that the three farm laws would affect Tamil Nadu badly, Mr. Pandian said they would lead to multi-national corporations (MNCs) exploiting the natural and water resources of the State. “Farmers will become slaves of the MNCs,” he added. Mr. Pandian called upon the AIADMK government to support the farmers’ struggle. “We welcome the AIADMK government’s pro-farmer moves, including declaring the Cauvery delta as a protected special agricultural zone and its efforts to uphold State rights with regard to the Cauvery issue. But its decision to support the three farm laws is a betrayal to the farmers and the entire Tamil community. It goes against the policies of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa,” he said. He urged Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Paneerselvam to reconsider their stand on the issue. “The AIADMK should tell the Prime Minister that they will quit the alliance if the demand to repeal the laws is not conceded to. They should join the struggle against the laws,” Mr. Pandian said. He called upon all farmers’ organisations and political parties of Tamil Nadu to participate in the protest in Chennai on December 11.

03 December 2020||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Safety measures in place as districts gear up for ‘Burevi’||Belying all weather predictions of heavy rains induced by Cyclone ‘Burevi’ in the southern districts from Wednesday onwards, none of the four districts received even a mild drizzle throughout a sultry day. Though the sky remained overcast throughout the day, the cool north-east wind was absent on Wednesday. The ‘calm before the storm’ was something unusual to the residents, who badly missed the incessant drizzle that drenches the coastal districts during weather systems like low pressure or deep depression. The district administration was busy alerting the teams deployed at several places based on the weather predictions received here. Monitoring Officer M. Karunakaran, District Collector V. Vishnu and Superintendent of Police N. Manivannan visited Koottapuli, where a relief centre has been established to accommodate the people to be evacuated from coastal hamlets possibly affected by the cyclone-induced downpour. Dr. Karunakaran said the all precautionary measures had been taken to face any eventuality and all basic requirements would be at relief centres including food, medical care and other facilities. “All irrigation tanks – both system and rain-fed tanks – had been brought under constant monitoring as heavy downpour has been predicted,” said Dr. Karunakaran. Mr. Vishnu said ‘fever clinics’ had been established in all relief centres where the evacuated people would be settled down until normalcy returns. Following instructions from the district administration, fishermen of the 13 coastal hamlets of the district have moved their fiberglass boats and the fishnets to safety as the sea would be rough over the next 48 hours due to strong winds and downpour. Thoothukudi In Thoothukudi, Minister for Information Kadambur C. Raju visited the cyclone warning centre at the Collectorate and the relief centre at St. Joseph’s Girls’ Higher Secondary School at Cruzpuram in the night along with Collector K. Senthil Raj. Superintendent of Police, Thoothukudi S. Jayakumar visited Terespuram, a hamlet situated very close to the shoreline in insanitary conditions and met the police personnel who have been deployed there. The police personnel helped the fishermen move the fiberglass country boats and fishnets to safety. While the two scheduled flights from Chennai and Bengaluru landed at Thoothukudi airport on Wednesday forenoon as usual, the two flights to be operated to Chennai in the afternoon were cancelled. However, a special flight was operated from Chennai that landed at Thoothukudi at 11.15 a.m. returned to the State capital with passengers, who had booked their tickets for the afternoon flight. “All the four flights to be operated from Thoothukudi to Chennai and Bengaluru on Thursday have been cancelled due to inclement weather predictions,” said N. Subramanian, Director, Thoothukudi Airport. The VOC Port had hoisted danger signal number 6 in the seaport even as the cyclone was slowly nearing Thoothukudi coast. Kanniyakumari Of the 172 mechanised boats from Kanniyakumari district involved in multi-day deep sea stay fishing, only 24 boats alone could not be contacted as these vessels are now fishing beyond Lakshadweep. While 48 vessels have reached the nearest fishing harbours in the west coast after the crew was alerted about the cyclone, the remaining 100 boats are on their way back to the shores. “All the boats are expected to reach the harbours before Thursday (December 3) morning,” a fisheries department official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/safety-measures-in-place-in-southern-districts/article33235719.ece
03 December 2020||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Cent per cent stock of essential commodities ensured in all ration shops||The district administration has taken steps to ensure cent per cent stock in all ration shops across the district so that cardholders in need of essential commodities can easily avail of it as the district braces for gale and heavy downpour over the next 48 hours. As cyclone ‘Burevi’, after making landfall in Trincomalee on Wednesday night, is likely to cross the southern districts on Thursday the heavy downpour may necessitate relocation of people living in vulnerable areas. Hence, Collector V. Vishnu has asked the Department of Public Distribution to ensure cent per cent stocks of essential commodities in all ration shops across the district by Thursday morning. Dr. Karunakaran said teams, each led by an official in the rank of Deputy Collector, had been deployed in each taluk to closely monitor the situation during the downpour and after the rains. All 87 vulnerable areas – 11 very high, 32 high, 13 medium and 31 low – in the district and the irrigation tanks were under constant monitoring by teams, which were being assisted by 633 local youth. In the 188 relief camps established to accommodate 8,000 relocated people, only 4,000 persons will be kept to ensure physical distancing. Steps have been taken to disburse relief immediately to the affected, he said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order), Tirunelveli City, S. Saravanan informed that 44 well-trained police personnel in rescue operations would be deployed in the city besides National Disaster Rescue Force personnel while 180 personnel would be deployed in rural areas. Dr. Karunakaran, accompanied by Mr. Vishnu, visited irrigation tanks at Nangnuneri and Vijaynarayanam, both gett water from Manimuthar dam, before inspecting the multi-purpose community hall at Koottapuli, one of the relief camps set-up in the coastal areas. Meanwhile, the NDRF personnel visited Karuppanthurai, Kailaasapuram and Vannarpettai areas, on Wednesday as these areas situated close to the Tamirabharani watercourse would be affected whenever the river swells.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cent-per-cent-stock-of-essential-commodities-ensured-in-all-ration-shops/article33236395.ece

03 December 2020||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Meet the man in Ooty who has grown a mini Shola forest||In a discreet corner of Udhagamandalam town, over 60 native Shola trees, numerous grasses, orchids and balsams thrive in the home of one of the town’s well-known dentists and experts on Toda culture. On his 23-cent property, Tarun Chhabra, points to an orchid ( Calanthe triplicata ), and speaks of its relevance to the indigenous Toda Adivasi community. “The Todas call this the taihhn-esh-toorr , or the honey-leaf plant. The flowering of this species is an indicator of the early stage of the Southwest monsoon and the leaves are perennial. The reason it is called the honey-leaf plant is because when the Todas are collecting honey from the hives of the Apis cerana bee in the tree cavities, they can fashion the leaves into a vessel to collect it,” said Mr. Chhabra. After moving into the property in 2012, Mr. Chhabra has planted a wide range of Shola tree species, including Syzigium densiflorum , Rhododendron arboreum , Symplocos cochinchinesi , Syzigium tamilnadensis and many others. Mr. Chhabra also has, in his collection, very rare plant species native to the Western Ghats, including five species of impatiens (balsams) as well as cobra lilies and native grasses, most of which are unique to the Ghats. “For instance, the Impatiens leschenaultii , found commonly in the Nilgiris and maybe in the Palani Hills as well, is unique, as you can find it flowering right through the year,” said Mr. Chhabra. The more than 60 trees in Mr. Chhabra’s residence and the other species of flora have quickly grown over the last seven years to dominate the area where he lives. “The growth of these trees is a testament to the fact that Shola species grow very quickly provided they are planted in the right conditions,” said Mr. Chhabra. He said there was a belief among the public that Shola tree species grow extremely slowly, which discourages people from actively trying to grow them in their homes. “The Todas rely on native flora for each and every ceremony, from their birth till death, and these ceremonies all played a key role in ensuring the protection of these species,” said Mr. Chhabra, highlighting the gradual disappearance of key species of grasses like Eriochrysis rangacharii -- known to the Todas as Avful -- from the landscape. “The Todas use this grass to re-thatch the roofs of their temples. However, due to changes in the landscape, such as the destruction of grasslands where this particular grass was found, the Todas have to trek more than 90 km to find this particular species of grass, which is becoming increasingly hard to find,” said Mr. Chhabra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/meet-the-man-in-ooty-who-has-grown-a-mini-shola-forest/article33236180.ece
03 December 2020||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Injured elephant being treated in MTR||An adult tusker is being treated for an injury to its back by forest department officials in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR). Local residents living in Bokkapuram in the buffer zone of the tiger reserve had noticed the tusker roaming around the village for the last three days, said Deputy Director of MTR (Buffer Zone), L.C.S. Srikanth. The elephant had been monitored by the forest department, who noticed that the animal had an injury to its back. “It was then decided that we would intervene and try to treat it,” said Mr. Srikanth. K. Rajesh Kumar, forest veterinarian at MTR, was part of the team of staff treating the animal. “We hid medicines to treat the animal inside some fruits which we left near to the injured tusker,” said Mr. Srikanth. The elephant was feeding and seemed to be otherwise healthy, he added. Officials said that the animal was not exhibiting any major signs of distress, but added that local residents were being cautioned to stay away from the animal. The officials added that the elephant will be monitored over the course of the next few days. “We will keep an eye on the animal and monitor its progress,” added Mr. Srikanth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/injured-elephant-being-treated-in-mtr/article33236182.ece

03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Delta ryots pitch new role for TNCSC||A section of farmers in the delta expect the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC) to take the lead and enter into agreements with small and marginal farmers for procurement of paddy under the ambit of the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and ensure an assured market and price for them. The Corporation, registered as a Public Sector Company under the Companies Act, procures, stocks and distributes essential commodities for the public distribution system, special PDS and noon meal programme. It also runs departmental stores as a market intervention measure to control prices of essential commodities like rice, dhal, edible oil, vegetables etc. The farmers says the Corporation, which also acts as a procurement agent for the Food Corporation of India, could very well don the robe of the term “sponsor” defined in the F(EP)APA and FS Act. “If the Corporation signs farming agreements with farmers to procure paddy at the minimum support price announced by the government, it will definitely avert the need for small and marginal farmers to dispose of their produce for a price lesser than the minimum suport price to private traders whenever there is a delay in procuring paddy at the DPCs,” says Aadhisivam of Umaiyalpuram, a progressive farmer. Stating that such a move will definitely spare small and marginal farmers the ordeal of transporting their produce from the field to the DPCs as the F(EP)APA and FS Act envisages delivery of farm produce at the farm gate, he says the Corporation in the past used to collect paddy from places near the fields. Arupathi P. Kalyanam, general secretary, Federation of Farmers Associations of Delta Districts suggests that it can sign farming agreements with a section of farmers so as to procure the quantum of paddy required to fulfil its obligation to supply rice through PDS, special PDS and the noon meal programme if the Corporation feels that it will not be possible to procure entire harvest or does not want to monopolise paddy procurement. For this purpose, the Corporation may consider entering into farming agreements with the Farmers’ Producers Organisations (FPO) says S. Ranganathan, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association. ‘Need for political will’ Entering into farming agreements with FPOs may help the Corporation avert, what it may feel, a laborious process of signing agreements with a huge number of farmers, given the pattern of landholdings in the State. However, a strong political will is required to implement such a measure, he adds. Expressing similar views, G. Srinivasan, a progressive farmer of Ganapathi Agraharam, says winnowing machines and portable paddy dryers can also be made available for nominal rent through the Farm Machines Lending Centres set up by the State government involving farmers groups or women self-help groups in every taluk. This will help farmers comply with the quality norms to be complied for selling their paddy to TNCSC. It can also sign farming agreements with FPOs that have taken up or contemplating to take up horticulture cultivation so that their produce can be sold through TNCSC departmental stores functioning in some urban centres, Mr. Srinivasan adds. If required the Corporation can also enter into an agreement with FPOs for procuring fine variety paddy for sale as rice through its departmental stores.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/delta-ryots-pitch-new-role-for-tncsc/article33235689.ece

Udayakumar said on Wednesday. The Minister, who was on a tour to inspect the coastal pockets of Ramanathapuram district, was accompanied by Special Monitoring Officer Dharmendra Pratap Yadav, District Collector Dinesh Ponraj Oliver and others. He took stock of the level of preparedness at Pamban, Thangachimadam, Arichalmunai and other areas.  ‘Preparing for cyclone’ Addressing a press conference, the Minister said as soon as they received the weather forecast from the IMD officials, the State government machinery started meticulously preparing for the cyclone. “We are on high alert. All officials have been entrusted with responsibilities. Persons, especially fishermen in the coastal stretches of the southern districts, have been asked to stay indoors and not venture into sea,” Mr. Udayakumar added. Apart from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the Coast Guard, INS Parundu and the police, personnel from the Public Works Department (PWD), Revenue, Fire and Rural Development departments were also present at designated locations. Currently, there were 3,500 first responders in Ramanathapuram district and 209 relief centres, including 104 schools, 20 colleges and 50 kalyana mandapams, he said. Mr. Udayakumar said out of the 641 PWD tanks and the 1,122 rural tanks, only 10 had touched the maximum water levels so far. District administrations in Ramanathapuram, Kanniyakumari, Thoothukudi and Tenkasi have functioning control rooms. Sand bags, electric posts and high-powered saw machines have also been provided to face any eventualities that may arise after the cyclone passes. Control rooms were functioning round the clock and people could reach it at 04567-230060, Mr. Ponraj added. In Tirunelveli, Monitoring Officer Karunakaran, accompanied by Collector Vishnu, visited irrigation tanks at Nangnuneri and Vijaynarayanam, both of which get water from the Manimuthar dam. The officials also inspected a multipurpose community hall at Koottapuli, one of the relief camps set up by the district administration in the coastal areas. Meanwhile, NDRF personnel visited Karuppanthurai, Kailaasapuram and Vannarpettai as they are situated close to the Tamirabharani watercourse. In Dindigul district District Collector M. Vijayalakshmi, in Dindigul, said there were 84 locations identified as “vulnerable” to heavy rain. In Kodaikanal hills alone, 15 teams have been positioned. The entire ghat section was being monitored by surveillance teams. In the event of landslides or tree falls, NDRF teams would be deployed. Monitoring Officer Ramesh Chand Meena took stock of the essential commodities being kept with the T.N. Civil Supplies Corporation and visited a relief centre in the district. Meanwhile, in Theni, Collector M. Pallavi Baldev said 66 relief centres were ready to be occupied for those who may have to move from their dwellings in the event of heavy rain in the district. Apart from first responders, boats have also been kept ready. Monitoring Officer A. Karthik said people have been asked to stay indoors for the next 48 hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/southern-districts-in-state-gear-up-to-face-cyclone/article33235704.ece
03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Tenant farmers agree to honour lease agreements||Farmers who have taken on lease agriculture lands of Hindu temples, mutts and other Hindu Charitable institutions in Thanjavur district have said that in future they will honour the lease agreements that entered into with the institutions. The assurance came at a tripartite meeting of officials from the Revenue Department, the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Department and tenant farmers held at the Office of the Revenue Divisional Officer, Kumbakonam, on Tuesday where the issue of non-issuance of cultivation certificates (CCs) to tenant farmers was discussed. On November 20, village administrative officers of hamlets in which the landholdings of Swaminathaswami Temple, Swamimalai, are located stopped issuing CCs to the tenant farmers citing a letter from the Temple Executive Officer. In that letter, the EO requested the VAOs not to issue CCs to the tenant farmers since they had not fulfilled the lease agreement for a long time. Subsequently, farmers claimed, the VAOs started declining the applications for CCs from tenant farmers of other temples and mutts coming under the HR and CE Department. While bringing the issue to the notice of Collector M. Govinda Rao, they pointed out that CCs had been issued to several lessee farmers of the same temple till November 19 and such farmers insured their crop under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (crop insurance) well before the Cyclone Niravi made the landfall on the Tamil Nadu coast. As a fallout, the Collector directed the Kumbakonam RDO to convene a meeting and sort out the issue. At the tripartite meeting, it came to light that middle-level officers in the HR and CE Department arbitrarily issued the letter, official sources said. However, the farmers claimed that they were not able to honour their commitment in view of non-disbursement of the contract amount to them from sugar mills and “improper allocation” of crop insurance compensation through financial institutions in the past. A detailed memorandum to substantiate this point was presented to the Kumbakonam RDO by Sundara Vimalanathan, secretary, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, at the meeting. In the memorandum, the Association said the lessor could get the paddy measured at the fields itself during the harvest so as get the lease agreement clause fulfilled without fail. As the other farmers had also agreed to fulfil the lease agreement clause in this fashion, the RDO directed the VAOs to issue the CCs to the tenant farmers to help them insure the crop under the PMFBY scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tenant-farmers-agree-to-honour-lease-agreements/article33235690.ece

Nearly 500 persons and their caregivers attached to the association participated in the protest. “Our main demand is implementation of the backlog of vacancies in State departments according to a 2013 Supreme Court judgment,” said P. Kumar of TARATDAC. Another demand was provision of 5% of jobs in the private sector as mandated by the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. “We have suffered the most during the pandemic. We have knocked on every door but in vain. No official wants to hear our pleas,” Mr. Kumar said. For 10 years there has been no change in the monthly assistance provided by the State government, they claimed. Neighbouring States pay at least Rs. 3,000, while Tamil Nadu continues to provide just Rs. 1,000 for persons with disabilities and Rs. 1,500 for those with severe disabilities. “Many were dependent on daily wages for survival. Now with COVID-19, they are helpless and their condition is only getting worse,” he added. The protesters demanded that the assistance be increased to Rs. 3,000 for all persons with disabilities and Rs. 5,000 a month for those with severe impairments. The protesters were taken into custody by the police and kept at a school ground nearby before being let off in the evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/persons-with-disabilities-seek-hike-in-monthly-dole/article33236388.ece

Govindu, Kannada activists, on the outskirts of Vijayapura city on Wednesday morning, to prevent them from holding a meeting on the December 5 bandh. A team of officers led by Additional Superintendent of Police Ram Arasiddhi took the two activists into custody at the entrance near Hittinahalli. They were taken to a guesthouse later. Mr. Nagaraj argued with the police who came to arrest him. He told journalists that Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa was behind his arrest. Mr. Govindu said that the fight of Kannada organisations was not against the Maratha community but against the appeasement of Marathi-speakers by the State government for electoral gains. Later, Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, MLA, told journalists at a private function that he would not talk about “insignificant persons” like Mr. Nagaraj. “Mr. Nagaraj has lost balance of his mind. He has no moral right to talk about me or about Mr. Yediyurappa. He is a fake activist. They have made fighting for Kannada a profitable business,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vatal-nagaraj-govindu-held/article33235879.ece
03 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Select suburban trains to resume services||The Railway Board has given its approval for the resumption for some of the suburban rail services in the city, which had been suspended for over eight months due to COVID-19. The Bengaluru division of South Western Railways (SWR) is likely to resume services, including MEMU/DEMU services on Hindupur-Yeshwanthpur, KSR Bengaluru-Marikuppam, Yeshwanthpur-Hassan, and superfast trains between Mysuru and Bengaluru. The approval was given on Wednesday based on a representation made by the SWR. The Board has also approved MEMU services from the city to Hosur for the first time. Chief Public Relations Officer of SWR E. Vijaya told The Hindu that in addition to special trains being operational after relaxation of lockdown norms, on Wednesday, the Board gave approval for 26 pairs of trains. “Based on requests from citizens, the General Manager of the SWR made a representation to the Railway Board on resumption of short distance passenger trains in the Bengaluru area . The proposal on resuming train services on identified routes has been cleared by the Ministry of Railways in a swift manner. Detailed notification indicating number of trips, days of services and others will be notified on Thursday, and trains will start running soon,” the official said. She added that 12 trains connecting Bengaluru with Mysuru, Hindupur, Hosur, Marikuppam and Bangarpet will start. Trains will be operated in accordance with protocols to reduce the risk of passengers contracting COVID-19. Regular commuters, who have resumed work, have welcomed this decision. “Before the pandemic and the lockdown, thousands of people travelled on a daily basis from Tumakuru, Kolar and other districts to Bengaluru on local trains. These trains are economical and save time as well. It has been over eight months, and people are spending a huge amount of money on other modes of travel,” said suburban rail activist Sanjeev Dyamannavar. He added that the authorities should make sure that train services are operated both in the morning and evening hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/select-suburban-trains-to-resume-services/article33236135.ece

Many claimed that the additional fees charged by private colleges are as high as Rs. 2 lakh. “At the time of the pandemic when families are constrained financially either due to job loss or salary cuts, the State government has hiked fees. “Now, some colleges are charging us even more,” said one student. Students have to pay additional charges as published in the Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA) website under four categories – miscellaneous fees, transport fees, hostel fees and mess fees. One student said that she had bagged a seat in a private college, which asked her to pay an additional fee of Rs. 1.99 lakh per year towards other expenses. “We understand that we have to pay for other expenses. But, charging an additional Rs. 2 lakh per annum is ridiculous. This is unaffordable for middle class families,” the student said. As per the consensual agreement with the government, the colleges can charge Rs. 15,000 as miscellaneous expenditure and Rs. 30,000 as expenditure for the skill lab. A student who bagged a dental seat said that they need to cap the hostel, mess, transportation and miscellaneous expenses so that they are affordable. The fee for government quota seats in private colleges was hiked by 15% and that of institutional quota seats was increased by 25%. Students pointed out that paying such a huge amount in the midst of the pandemic would be very difficult as the finances of their parents had been severely affected due to COVID-19. For this academic year, fees in private medical colleges are Rs. 1.28 lakh for government quota and Rs. 9.81 lakh for institutional quota seats. In private dental colleges, the fee for a government quota seat is Rs. 83,356 and that for an institutional quota seat is Rs. 6.66 lakh.  We understand that we have to pay for other expenses. But, charging an additional Rs. 2 lakh per annum is ridiculous.

03 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘No govt. mechanism to implement court’s orders’||Taking note of a large number of civil contempt of court petitions filed by citizens alleging failure of the government officials in adhering to the court’s orders, the High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday said that the State government has to set up a machinery to overcome this scenario. The court observed that there is no mechanism in the government to implement the court’s orders after the office of the State Advocate-General forwards the copies of the court’s orders in various cases. There should be nodal officers in the government to ensure implementation of the court’s order by bringing such orders to the notices of the officials concerned, said a Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty while suo motu taking note of large number of contempt petitions being filed by the litigants. The litigant-citizens are put to loss in two ways due to non-implementation of court’s order as they are not only unable to get fruits of the orders in their favour but also forced to spend money for the contempt of court proceedings, the Bench pointed out. Also, the Bench said that even the government officers would also not benefit from contempt proceedings as they will have to attend to such proceedings instead of carrying out their regular duties besides requiring to engaged private advocates in contempt proceedings. Observing that it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that its officials adhere to the court’s orders, the Bench asked the government to make a statement whether it is willing to establish a machinery to implement court orders by designating nodal officers for effectively monitoring the process of implementation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-govt-mechanism-to-implement-courts-orders/article33235764.ece
03 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Over 60 volunteers enrol for Covaxin trials at Vydehi on first day||Over 60 volunteers enrolled for Phase-III clinical trials of ‘Covaxin’ that began at Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre in Bengaluru on Wednesday. The COVID-19 vaccine is being developed by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The institute’s Medical Director K.M. Srinivas Murthy told The Hindu that the hospital has roped in Clintrac International Ltd. for the trials, which will involve about 1,000 volunteers. “The volunteers need not stay in the hospital. They will be closely monitored daily through phone/video calls for feedback and updates. They will be given a booster dose 28 days after the first dose. They will be observed for two-three hours in the hospital after the booster dose and sent home,” he said. “Our experts and research team will evaluate the trial results. The third phase of the trial is critical in determining the success of a vaccine. The final data from the trials will be submitted for analysis to the Drugs Controller General of India for validation. We are hoping for a positive outcome at the earliest,” Dr. Murthy said. D.V. Chalapathy, co-investigator of the trials, said the volunteers will be a mix of men and women above 18 years of age. “As the vaccine candidate is preventive and curative, it will be given to those who test negative and are asymptomatic. Anyone who wants to volunteer can walk into our institute and enrol,” he said. 25 centres Covaxin trials are going to be successful in Karnataka and the State is fully prepared for its distribution, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said on Wednesday. He was speaking after the launch of Phase-III trials. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa joined the event via video conference. Clinical trials are happening at 25 centres of 12 States across the country. About 26,000 people are being administered the vaccine. Around 1,600-1,800 people are being administered vaccination in Karnataka alone. “People should be wary of rumours and misinformation during this trial period,” he said. On the side-effects of vaccine, he said that around 15-20% Indian companies were developing the vaccination globally. “There may be side-effects. Experts are observing it carefully and there is no need for panic at this stage.” Funds reserved Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the NDA government has reserved Rs. 900 crore for vaccine research. The PM visited and inspected the research centres in Pune, Ahmadabad and Hyderabad. The State government has set aside Rs. 300 crore for vaccine trials. Treatment will be given for free to COVID-19 patients. About 1.25 lakh tests were conducted per day in the State and 1.2 crore free testing has been conducted so far, the Minister said. Distribution centres The State was fully prepared for vaccine distribution, and 29,451 vaccine distribution centres have been identified. About 10,008 trained staff would be deployed for the purpose. A total of 2,855 cold storage centres were made available for storage of vaccines. Regional centres were being set up in Bengaluru, Shivamogga and Ballari. Healthcare workers would be given the vaccination in the first phase followed by front-line warriors, people aged above 50 years and people with co-morbidities, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/over-60-volunteers-enrol-for-covaxin-trials-at-vydehi-on-first-day/article33235762.ece
03 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Experts worry about ‘door-to-door delivery’ of virus||With the State Election Commission announcing the gram panchayat polls despite the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) recommending postponement till February-end, experts are now worried about “door-to-door delivery” of the virus. With a second wave expected in January-February (three to four months after the first spike), there is already a fear that the winter season, weak enforcements, population movement, and large gatherings can trigger an early spike. Now, with the polls that involve very intense campaigning where candidates and workers visit each and every home multiple times to seek votes, the State’s efforts in achieving a decline in the caseload should not be lost, experts said. Asserting that it’s not the right time to conduct the polls, C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said: “There is a possibility of the virus spreading door to door if any of the campaigners is infected. Experts can only advise and it is up to the authorities to consider it.” He said the only way forward now is to ensure that all COVID-19 precautions are followed diligently. “All campaigners should compulsorily wear masks while canvassing. The State Election Commission should take care to avoid crowding at polling booths. This can be done by setting up more booths in every panchayat,” he said. “A week after the polls, there should be aggressive random testing of all involved in the elections so that cases can be identified, isolated, and treated early,” he said. Sudarshan Ballal, chairman of Manipal Hospitals, who is also part of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee, said authorities should ensure that the polls do not lead to another surge. “We cannot afford another surge now, especially when we are seeing a decline in cases. We have to be extra careful till a vaccination is possible,” he said. “Usually during campaigning, all precautions go for a toss. Our fear is the large gatherings where people do not follow social distancing and mask wearing. People should understand that health is most important and follow all precautions and the election authorities should strictly enforce this,” Dr. Ballal added. A senior member of TAC, who did not want to be quoted, said it was unfortunate that the committee’s recommendation had not been considered by the State Election Commission. “Our worry is that the polls may act as a spark for the second wave, especially in districts where our seroprevalence survey showed low prevalence,” he said. Admitting that TAC had recommended postponement of the polls, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said the government will take necessary precautions to ensure that infection does not spread owing to the polls. “I also appeal to all political parties, candidates, and workers to follow precautions and cooperate with the government in containing the spread of the virus,” he added. Revised SOPs Meanwhile, Health Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey has written to State Election Commission regarding revised Standard Operating Procedures to be followed to avoid spread of COVID-19 during the conduct of the elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/experts-worry-about-door-to-door-delivery-of-virus/article33235877.ece
03 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Leasing of lands: HC notice to govt.||The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday ordered issue of notice to the State government on a PIL petition questioning the decision to permanently grant its lands, already leased to various private organisations, at a price equivalent to the guidance values to overcome the State’s financial crisis owing to COVID-19. A Division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S.Vishwajith Shetty passed the order on the petition filed by Umapathi.S, a city-based advocate, who has challenged the government’s July 6, 2020 notification. The notification stated that leased lands could be permanently granted to industrial, educational, religious, agricultural and non-agricultural organisations for the value equivalent to land’s guidance value fixed by the government if the organisations want to utilise lands for the same purpose for which it was granted originally. However, the organisations will have to pay double the guidance value if they want lease to be made permanent grant for using land for purpose other than originally leased. Claiming that the notification to convert lease into permanent grant was issued by ignoring the actual market value of these lands, the petitioner has alleged that the policy is contrary to the procedure of auction to be followed by the government to generate maximum revenue from the properties to the State Exchequer. The government, it has been claimed in the petition, can generate revenue by properly collecting lease rent, arrears of lease rent, revision of lease rent from organisations as per the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India while pointing out that thousands of acres of government lands have been leased to organisations linked to political leaders. Stating that the provisions of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act and the Land Revenue Rules do not empower the government to permanently grant these lands beyond the period of lease, the petitioner has contended that the action of the government amounts to favouritism, nepotism, and violative of constitutional provisions of equity before the law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/leasing-of-lands-hc-notice-to-govt/article33235765.ece
03 December 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Cong. seeks probe by HC judge into Vishwanath’s remark||The State Congress on Wednesday demanded a probe by a sitting judge of the Karnataka High Court into alleged confessions made by A.H. Vishwanath, MLC, that Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had sent a “big amount” of money to him during the byelections to the Hunsur Assembly constituency, but he had not received the amount, which led to his defeat. Mr. Vishwanath, who was disqualified by the High Court from becoming a Minister, on Tuesday alleged that C.P. Yogeshwar, MLC, and Chief Minister’s political secretary N.R. Santosh had hatched a conspiracy to defeat him in the byelections held last December by not giving him the money provided by the Chief Minister. Taking a serious note of his remarks, Congress leaders B.L. Shankar and V.S. Ugrappa asked Mr. Vishwanath to inform the public the quantum of amount. “What is the source of the money sent by the Chief Minister? The truth could be revealed only through the probe into the source of money laundering by the High Court’s sitting judge,” Mr. Ugrappa said. Referring to various developments surrounding the Chief Minister’s office in the recent days, the Congress leaders said Mr. Yediyurappa and BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel owe an explanation to the people on the source of money and the amount given to the party’s candidate during the byelections to Hunsur constituency. “Is it Rs. 10 crore or Rs. 25 crore? The Chief Minister must explain to the people of the State,” Mr. Ugrappa said. Incurring expenditure of a huge amount of money during elections was a violation of the model code of conduct. The Election Commission, CBI, ED, and IT should take up suo motu investigation of the case. Why are the agencies silent?, the Congress leaders asked.  A.H. Vishwanath, MLC, said that Chief Minister B.S.

Yediyurappa on Wednesday laid the foundation, remotely, for a waste-to-energy (WtE) plant at Bidadi, being developed by Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd (KPCL). The plant is expected to be operational by the end of 2022 and is set to be the first WtE plant in the State. Though the State government had signed up several private firms to set up WtE plants in the city, not one of them materialised in nearly a decade. Processing capacity The Bidadi plant is being developed by KPCL and BBMP, each agency putting in Rs. 130 crore. It will have the capacity to process 600 TPD of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) to generate 11.5 MW of power, adding up to an annual output of 80.59 million units, which will be evacuated to KPTCL’s 220 kV Bidadi sub-station through an underground cable. The plant will incinerate the RDF to produce energy and is compliant with Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The plant will have a lifespan of 20 years. Segregated waste The key to the success of the plant is the civic body providing 600 TPD of RDF, which will be available only in case of scientifically segregated waste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/karnataka-to-get-first-waste-to-energy-plant-in-2022/article33236131.ece

Varthur Prakash. He and his driver were allegedly kidnapped while they were returning from a farmhouse on November 25 and tortured for three days by an armed gang of eight men The former Kolar MLA met Home Minister Basavaj Bommai on Wednesday to discuss the probe.

He said at a press conference in Shivamogga on Wednesday that many Hindu women had been cheated by Muslim youths in the name of love and marriage. “Muslim youths have left many women after marriage.

03 December 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Corpn. decides to demolish Central Market buildings||The council of the Mangaluru City Corporation in its meeting here on Wednesday resolved to demolish the two old Central Market buildings and build a modern vegetable and fish market building. Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. (MSCL) will reconstruct the new market building under the Smart City Mission. An agenda tabled in the meeting on the subject said that the two existing buildings which are about 50 years old are in poor condition and are in such a state that they cannot be repaired. There is a need to re-construct the market building with all infrastructure for the benefit of people and to increase the revenue of the corporation. The existing traders in the buildings have been served notices with regard to the demolition and reconstruction. Commissioner of the corporation Akshy Sridhar told the council that an independent consulting agency, Enstructura Consultants Private Ltd., hired by the corporation, has submitted a report that the buildings are fit for demolition. Leader of the Opposition in the council Abdul Rauf said that many traders who were doing business in the Central Market have been put to trouble after the market was closed down eight months ago due to the COIVD-19 restrictions. Hence, the existing traders in the market and all others who were doing business there earlier should be rehabilitated. The market had 470 traders pre-lockdown. In addition, many others were leading their life being indirectly dependent on Central Market. Thus, it was providing employment to about 3,000 persons. There is a need to accommodate all the 470 traders elsewhere after the demolition of the two buildings, he said. Whip in the council Premananda Shetty told the meeting that the ward offices of the corporation at Lady Hill, Mannagudda Gurji and at Gandhinagar will be re-built in the first phase, as they are in poor condition. It has also been proposed to reconstruct the ward offices in Bunder, Port and near the old bus stand later. The new ward offices will have rooms for men and women civic workers, drinking water facility, toilets and bathrooms, storerooms as per the guidelines issued by Karnataka Commission for Safai Karmacharis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/corpn-decides-to-demolish-central-market-buildings/article33236284.ece
03 December 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Corpn. to seek Rs. 20 crore from govt. to acquire land||Mangaluru City Corporation Council in its meeting on Wednesday decided to seek Rs. 20 crore from the State government for acquiring 1.25 acres of private land for widening the road between Morgan’s Gate and National Highway 66 via Mahakalipadpu railway crossing. Whip in the council Premananda Shetty told the council that it was a vital link road between the city and the Kasaragod-Mangaluru-Udupi National Highway. Earlier, the Chief Secretary of theState had directed that the civic body and the government share the funds required for the land acquisition equally as Rs. 10 crore each. If the corporation is to bear its share, it should be from the funds available under its premium floor area ratio account. But as per the current provisions, the funds available under premium floor area ratio account should not be diverted for acquiring land and to pay compensation, as it should be used only for road development and road widening projects. Hence, the government should be requested to sanction the entire amount of Rs. 20 crore to acquire the land. An agenda tabled in the meeting on the matter said that a total of 3.75 acres of private land is required for widening the road. Of this, the land owner has agreed to part 2.5 acres of land through provisions under transferable development rights (TDR). But the remaining 1.25 acres of land will have to be acquired. It said that a railway underpass will have to be built at Mahakalipadpu railway crossing as part of the road development project. It would cost about Rs. 30 crore. Hence, the total project cost would be Rs. 50 crore. The project would be taken up by Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. (MSCL) under the Smart City Mission. There is no provision under the mission to spend its funds for acquiring private land required for the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/corpn-to-seek-rs-20-crore-from-govt-to-acquire-land/article33236283.ece

The fishermen, Vinod Harikantra, Mahesh, Lokesh, Shekhar, Gangadhar Jatga Mogera, Nagappa Narayan Harikanthra and Anil Gatabeera Harikant, onboard Mathura deep sea fishing vessel owned by Tharanath Kunder of Malpe, were stricken by panic when the vessel began to sink. Fishermen in another fishing vessel, Mahur, that was nearby heard their screams, and extended a helping hand. Using satellite-based BSNL-Skylo two-way communication technology, Mahur was able to raise an alarm with the Mathura’s owner as well as with the Maharashtra Coastal Security Police. The exact location of the vessel in distress was shared with the authorities which helped in the rescue operation. Tharanath Kunder [Mathura’s owner] said that it was fortunate that the fishermen in the other boat were able to help his people with modern communication system.

03 December 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Spandana: Pratap Simha defends Rohini Sindhuri||Mysuru MP Pratap Simha on Wednesday came out in support of Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri over the Spandana programme launched by her to take the administration to the rural parts of the district. Speaking to reporters in Mysuru, Mr. Simha said the Deputy Commissioner had taken up the programme for the benefit of the people and regretted that the MLAs, instead of supporting the good initiative, had opposed it on the grounds that she had not taken their permission. “Just because they have become MLAs does not mean that the DC should take their permission to hold programmes for the benefit of the people”, Mr. Simha argued. He criticised a section of the MLAs for “ganging up” against the Deputy Commissioner and threatening her with moving a “privilege motion”. The MP also recalled that the former Minister in charge of Mysuru district V. Somanna, during a Karnataka Development Programme (KDP) meeting in January 2020, had asked the officials including Deputy Commissioner, Tahsildars and Assistant Commissioners to go to the people instead of sitting in their respective offices and help the needy. Mr. Simha criticised Hunsur MLA H.P. Manjunath for stating that the Deputy Commissioner was behaving like a ‘Maharani’. “He went personal against her and used inappropriate language”, the MP said and questioned the MLA’s contribution to his constituency ever since he was electedabout a year ago. Mr. Simha maintained that the Spandana programme launched by the Deputy Commissioner has not been cancelled. When his attention was drawn to Revenue Minister R. Ashok’s recent announcement in Mysuru that the programme had been cancelled, Mr. Simha said the Revenue Minister had said that the government’s programme to take administration to the doorsteps of the people will be started soon. Interestingly, the day Mr. Ashok told reporters that he had instructed Ms. Sindhuri to cancel the progamme in the wake of her tiff with MLAs, the Department of Information and Public Relations in Mysuru sent a message to reportersthat the Spandana programmes will not be held in view of the code of conduct coming into force following the announcement of gram panchayat elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/spandana-pratap-simha-defends-rohini-sindhuri/article33235872.ece
03 December 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Vishwanath upset with Yediyurappa||Former Minister A.H. Vishwanath, who was disqualified by the High Court from becoming a Minister, has expressed strong disapproval of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s conduct and his move to induct former Minister C.P. Yogeshwar into the Cabinet. Speaking to reporters in Mysuru on Wednesday, Mr. Vishwanath said “gratitude was fast falling in politics” and added that Mr. Yediyurappa was today a far different from the person who stood in front of him before the formation of the BJP government in the State. He questioned Mr. Yediyurappa’s move to ‘urgently’ include Mr. Yogeshwar in the Cabinet and wondered if he was taking such ‘inappropriate’ decisions due to his ‘age’ or ‘pressure’. If Mr. Yediyurappa wants to make Mr. Yogeshwar a Minister ‘urgently’, how will others have trust in him, the BJP MLC asked, while questioning Mr. Yogeshwar’s role in the formation of the BJP government. “Was he an MLA? No. Did he resign? No”, Mr. Vishwanath said. When the BJP High Command has not given him the green signal to expand the Cabinet, why is the Chief Minister bent on hurriedly including Mr. Yogeshwar in the Cabinet, Mr. Vishwanath asked before pointing out that there were more senior and experienced administrators from north Karnataka such as Basavaraj Patil Yatnal from Vijayapura and Umesh Katti from Belagavi, who were more deserving.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vishwanath-upset-with-yediyurappa/article33235878.ece

After having to relocate to Mysuru, he rented out the flat. But as COVID-19 struck, leading to job loss and pay cut, his tenant requested him to lower the rent, which he did by Rs. 6,000. However, as work from home continued, in September, the tenant decided to head back to his hometown in a neighbouring State. The flat has been vacant since then, though Mr. Khan has put out ads on real estate portals with a rent amount much lower than earlier. Once booming, the rental real estate business in Bengaluru is now characterised by ‘to-let’ boards across many residential areas. Online real estate forums as well as “no-broker” platforms are seeing a substantially high quantum of ad postings for vacant rental properties while real estate agencies are also reporting the same. According to 99acres, the movement of residential rental listings in Bengaluru on the portal has seen a year-on-year growth of 19%. “If we need to take a look at the impact on rental values (ask price), then we will have to look at a locality level since different localities have behaved differently,” Maneesh Upadhaya, Chief Business Officer, 99acres.co, told The Hindu . According to the platform, Rajajinagar, which has 35% to 46% market share in the 2BHK and 3BHK segments, has had the highest change in year-on-year rental asks (9%). Whitefield, on the other hand, with 40% to 35% (2BHK and 3BHK) has had no change. G. Dinesh Poojary from S.R. Real Estate, said the trend began almost as soon as he COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown was announced. “Work from home was declared for most companies and many even lost jobs. In fact, even those from within Karnataka, who were working in Bengaluru, went back to their hometowns as paying rent and arranging for food became a problem,” he said. The sudden slump has also had an impact on the rent amounts, with demands for lower rents also being seen on social media platforms. In fact, owner postings that quote “pre-COVID-19” rent amounts are attracting trolls. “Some owners are now reducing the rent amount by around 20% because it is better than leaving it empty. For example, those who were charging Rs. 15,000 are reducing it to Rs. 10,000. We expect the situation to improve only once work from home is cancelled. But once the market improves, the rent will certainly increase,” Mr. Poojari said. Not just lower rent, some tenants are also looking at the current scenario as an opportunity to upgrade to better rental accommodation with their present budget. Sunil Singh from the firm Realty Corp said the number of vacant rentals had definitely increased, but so have enquiries. “The number of enquiries has increased since a month or so. But now, the tenant-side scenario is that they are expecting a good deal. If they were paying Rs. 40,000 for a 2 BHK, they are now looking for a 3 BHK in the same budget,” he explained. Rentals are down across segments, he said, adding that property owners understand. “To an extent, they are willing to negotiate depending on the client profile. Once a vaccine is ready, and people return to their desks, things will change,” he said. Unable to maintain properties they had invested in, some of them exclusively to rent out, some owners are also looking at selling such properties. “Around 10% owners are selling properties. On the other hand, some tenants are also looking at this as an opportunity to buy,” Mr. Singh added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/to-let-boards-become-common-as-wfh-job-loss-keep-tenants-away/article33236138.ece

Winners of the Infosys Prize 2020 agreed that the pandemic had not only impacted how research and academics are being carried out now, but has also had a telling effect on these areas for the future. Interacting with journalists during a virtual press conference on Wednesday to announce the winners, Prof. Sourav Chatterjee from Stanford University, who won the prize for the Mathematical Sciences category, said with meetings going virtual, it had created a repository of recordings, including of great speakers, which could be saved for posterity. “The culture of academics is changing,” he said. The other change is of multidisciplinary research coming to the fore. “There is a huge international concerted effort leading to the fight against the pandemic. It will be a great thing for science, though it is tragic,” he added. The winner in the Engineering and Computer Science category, Prof. Hari Balakrishnan from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the reaction to the pandemic by society has been “extraordinary”, including how quickly the vaccine is being developed. This, he said, was not “magic,” but a result of years of hard work. “The web is only 30 years old, but today, we feel like we are in the same room. Key applications will come later, built on research done now. The ability of society to react is based on research. Investment and research today will allow society to react to what comes next,” he said. Dr. Prachi Deshpande from the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences (CSSS), Kolkata, who won in the Humanities category added that there is hope that people will draw on a lot of work in social sciences and humanities as we move forward, pointing to how the present pandemic was also about the impact of the lockdown and other aspects. The vaccine question When asked about the race for a vaccine against the coronavirus, Dr. Rajan Sankaranarayanan from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, winner in the Life Sciences category, said, “We know we need multiple solutions. We will have multiple arsenals in our kitties.” He added that just as initial theories of “herd immunity” went bust, when we look at vaccination as a programme, there will be serious implementation issues. “It might be months or a year,” he said. Geopolitics and research Responding to questions on whether geopolitics will come into play in science and research, Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys and president of the Infosys Science Foundation, said good quality research requires an openness to ideas, discussions, learning from each other and other countries, and being open to share what we know with other countries. “Though nationalism has become stronger in the last four or five years, there will be progress in science and technology to solve the world’s problems,” he said. Winner in the Physical Sciences category, Prof. Arindam Ghosh from the IISc., Bangalore, said the importance of self-reliance has become more important than ever because the technology we buy or get are not becoming certain any more.  Key applications will come later, built on research done now. The ability of society to react is based on research. Investment and research today will allow society to react to what comes next Prof. Hari Balakrishnan, Massachusetts Institute of Technology   There is a huge international concerted effort leading to the fight against the pandemic.

The original landmark Gurudwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha in Ulsoor was razed four months ago to make way for a bigger place of worship. The original gurudwara was initially started by a few families in 1946 and served a small community of Sikhs. According to Raj Kamal Singh, manager of the gurudwara, over the years, the footfall had increased, and the new building will be better suited to accommodate people. When the gurudwara was constructed, the footfall was around a hundred a day. “Before the outbreak of COVID-19, the number of visitors on Sundays would cross 6,000. There was just not enough space to accommodate these many people,” he said. This is the sole reason for the trust managing the gurudwara to take the hard decision to raze the original white structure. “The old structure was demolished around four months ago. Currently, excavation for the foundation is being done. We have encountered rocks, which has delayed the work,” he said and added that they hoped the new gurudwara will have more capacity in the prayer hall and parking facilities. A temporary arrangement has been made next to where the original structure stood for devotees. Mr. Singh said they have been organising ‘langar’ even during the lockdown, and distributing food and dry rations to the needy across the city. “With the outbreak of the pandemic in the city, the footfall has fallen due to several restrictions in place. We have shifted to a temporary structure now. Even here, we ensure that the devout maintain social distancing norms, wear masks and have access to hand sanitisers. The activities of the gurudwara are also continuing, despite the fall in the number of visitors,” he added.  We have shifted to a temporary structure.

MAP is the custodian of a growing collection of over 18,000 art works, predominantly from the subcontinent and dating from the 10th century to the present. It will launch a digital version of the museum this month while its flagship physical space will come up in 2021. Accenture Labs, through its Tech4Good initiative, combined advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) with human-centered design, and will create India’s first conversational digital persona to help visitors have a more engaging experience. With this, visitors to the museum will be able to have a lifelike conversation with the persona in the display, according to the company. To create the digital persona, Accenture Labs used techniques such as face superimposition and speech synthesis, which are based on deep learning and generative AI models. Natural language understanding, natural language processing, and emotion detection technologies help ensure the conversation between the user and the persona. Abhishek Poddar, founder-trustee, MAP, said, “One of our objectives is to create a museum-going culture that engages younger generations, as we have much to learn from our shared histories. A great way for museums to accomplish this is to harness technology to create engaging interactions that enable the user to learn something new and have fun in the process.” Rekha M. Menon, chairperson and senior managing director, Accenture in India, said, “We are excited to team up with a cultural institution like MAP and use our market-leading digital capabilities to broaden the appeal of visual arts among today’s digital native youth.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/city-to-host-indias-first-ai-enabled-conversational-digital-persona/article33236139.ece

The deceased, Shimav Micheal Kambrekar, hailed from Yellapur in Uttara Kannada district. He had been working as a driver for a hotel chain in Bengaluru for the last two years. According to his family, he was denied a salary for the last 10 months. He returned to his hometown, but would call up his employer asking for his pending dues as he was getting married on November 22. His family informed the police that he went back to Bengaluru on November 17 with the aim of collecting his salary, after which they did not hear from him.

Roshan Baig on Wednesday, but only for around six hours after which he was remanded back in judicial custody. “We took him into custody around 10 a.m., and questioned him about his association with IMA founder Mohammed Mansoor Khan. He denied all the allegations, terming them as baseless,” said an official. The CBI has decided against seeking an extension to question him. Earlier, the CBI had sought custody of Baig for three days, but he complained of illness and had to be admitted to Jayadeva Hospital where he underwent an angiogram. After he was discharged and taken back to Central Prison, Parappana Agrahara, the CBI approached the court again on Tuesday and was granted one-day custody. Officials wanted to question him with Khan, but could not do so. The IMA founder has been remanded back in judicial custody. The next hearing of the case is scheduled on December 4 where the bail application of Baig will be heard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ima-scam-cbi-questions-baig/article33236132.ece

03 December 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Sivasankar assisted Swapna: ED||There is sufficient material to prove that M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to Chief Minster Pinarayi Vijayan, is guilty of money laundering in connection with the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case, according to a report filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the High Court while objecting to a bail petition filed by the accused. The ED submitted that Mr. Sivasankar was not only involved in the smuggling through the diplomatic channel of Thiruvannathapuram international airport but had assisted prime accused Swapna Suresh to launder her tainted money with the help of his chartered accountant P. Venugopal as well. Sivasankar’s role The ED said it was investigating into a 2019 incident in which a cargo addressed to the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram was released without examining it after Mr. Sivasankar contacted a senior Customs officer. The appraiser posted at the Cochin Customs Freight station admitted that she released the cargo without opening and examining it. Mr. Sivasankar had admited in his statement given to ED on October 15 that he did speak to a senior Customs officer and made the request as per the wishes of Swapna. This amounts to misuse of his office and interference in the official working of another government department, the ED said.  The report said Mr. Sivanakar had also received kickback from Unitac, which undertook the construction of apartments under a LIFE Mission project. He was supervising the implementation of the project in his capacity as Principal Secretary. The kickback was received for facilitating the award of contract of one of the projects under the LIFE Mission. In fact, this had been confirmed by Swapna in a statement given to the ED on November 10.  Meanwhile, when the bail petition came up for hearing before Justice Ashok Menon, Jaideep Gupta, senior Supreme Court lawyer, appearing Mr. Sivasankar, argued that there was no material to connect him with the gold smuggling case and his involvement in any process or activities connected with the proceeds of crime, including its concealment or possession. He pointed out that as per the ED’s earlier narrative, the proceeds of the crime was generated from the gold smuggling while it later stated that the proceeds of the crime was derived from the bribe in connection with the LIFE Mission project implementation. There were no proper allegations of money laundering against Mr. Sivasankar which could satisfy the definition of the money laundering under Section 3 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. The allegation that he had tried to influence the Customs to clear the diplomatic baggage had no basis. The court adjourned to December 8 the further hearing on the bail petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sivasankar-assisted-swapna-ed/article33235856.ece
03 December 2020||Kochi,KERALA||A bridge not too far for KSS candidates in Kadamakudy||In the last local body election, polling officials had to bring the entire election paraphernalia piled on a raft to set up polling booths in Pizhala, part of Kadamakudy panchayat. Five years down the line officials are spared of that, thanks to the Pizhala-Moolampilly bridge, the influence of which seems to have stretched to the electoral arena, so to speak. For, contesting from wards 10, 11, and 12 (Pizhala north and south, and Paliyamthuruth) of Kadamakudy panchayat are candidates under the banner of Karamuttikkal Samara Samiti (KSS), formed to give collective vent to the simmering anger of local residents after the inordinately delayed and incomplete Pizhala-Moolampilly bridge left them completely marooned in the 2018 deluge. The outfit then spearheaded a protest enlisting youngsters and women for the completion of the bridge, which was eventually opened this June, nearly eight years after the construction was launched. “Initially, we thought it was just about the bridge but then people encouraged us to look beyond it and contest the local body polls reminding us that if we could do as much without power, how much more we can do by participating in governance. We want to be the voice of people that cannot be ignored in the governance of Kadamakudy panchayat where the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the United Democratic Front (UDF) seem to be hand in glove,” said Sandra Manu, chairperson of KSS. From better roads and a hospital with round-the-clock care to seamless drinking water supply and restoration of ferry services, the organisation has brought out an exhaustive manifesto. “We are seeking votes on our action and not on empty promises like political parties who continue to dish around the same unfulfilled promises, which they have failed to deliver over the years,” said Magline Philomina, patron of KSS. Fronts confident The LDF, however, waved away the challenge posed by the outfit as a temporary phenomenon with little electoral impact except in one ward. “They have managed to whip up some local sentiments in ward 10 by exploiting the internal differences within the Congress. Whatever drain in votes will be from the Congress while our vote base will be intact in all three wards,” said T.K. Vijayan, LDF convener for Kadamakudy. Congress on the other hand was confident of victory in ward 10. “Their presence may turn the contest triangular in the other two wards though we remain confident of overcoming the challenge by effective campaigning,” said a senior block-level Congress functionary contesting the election. T.A. Simon, a resident of Pizhala and a Congress sympathiser, however, felt that KSS had popular support. “They were instrumental in the completion of the bridge and they have fielded good candidates,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-bridge-not-too-far-for-kss-candidates-in-kadamakudy/article33236261.ece
03 December 2020||Kochi,KERALA||LDF promises e-governance in six months||The Left Democratic Front (LDF) released its manifesto for the Kochi Corporation election on Wednesday promising the implementation of the e-governance project within six months of assuming power. A solid waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram, permanent solutions to waterlogging issues and green city initiative figure among the promises in the manifesto released by critic M.K. Sanoo here. P. Rajeev, former MP, who spoke on the occasion termed the 10 years of the United Democratic Front rule in the civic body as a failure. “Despite tall claims, it could not even provide key certificates to the public online. The government had to intervene and find solutions to the waterlogging problem and waste issue at Brahmapuram as the civic authorities could not find a proper solution,” he said. The manifesto promised the completion of the city gas project and promotion of solar energy projects. For waterlogging, the idea is to divide the corporation areas into various zones and introduce area-based scientific solutions. Trees will be planted along walking alleys, lakes and canals as part of the greening project. Canals will be cleared to check mosquito menace. The assistance of experts from the Cochin University of Science and Technology will be sought to reduce mosquito problem. Sewage treatment plants will be set up in association with the government. Modernised slaughterhouses will be set up at Mattancherry and Kaloor. The front will ensure health for the needy at affordable rates. More family health centres will be introduced. On the proposals for the transport sector, the manifesto has recommended modern boat jetty at Fort Kochi; cycling tracks; mini bus service connecting major stations; and promotion of water transport. Other promises include environment-friendly zones for walking; implementation of Padma Sarovaram project without reclamation of the Vembanad lake; beautification of Fort Kochi beach; new building for the corporation; and homestays for women.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-promises-e-governance-in-six-months/article33236265.ece

The project now caters for over 1,000 children, including 78 in their home States, spread over 35 government and aided schools in the district. “Our resource team of seven senior EVs for Classes 1 to 7 watch classes aired through Victers Channel and create interactive and adaptive modules in the form of pictures and videos based on our trusted system of code-switching. The modules are then disseminated over 35 separate WhatsApp groups of schools, and students are required to submit works based on the modules,” said Jayasree Kulakkunnath, academic coordinator of Roshni. (Code-switching involves a speaker alternating between two or more languages in the context of a single conversation). The project has been divided into four regions — Thripunithura and Kolancherry, Ernakulam, Aluva, and Perumbavoor and Kothamangalam — for administrative efficacy and is monitored by general coordinator C.K. Prakash. Creating modules for the 120-odd first standard students who haven’t experienced any form of schooling before remains a more onerous task. “Since the majority of them are comfortable in Hindi, we have to make those modules predominantly in that language using animation tools while switching between Malayalam and English accordingly. They have already started reading and writing Malayalam and English,” said Roopa John, the senior EV for Class one students. Besides, four common study centres are being run in Perumbavoor region while EVs and teachers visit migrant households to engage students. “Sometimes, such visits help revive the interest of students who are otherwise lethargic in their response. It also helps us bring in new students into the fold,” said Abraham C.A, Headmaster of Government Girls LPS, Perumbavoor.  “A Rs. 78 lakh-proposal for the restructured project encompassing all components has been submitted to BPCL, which has been assisting the project,” said Honey V. Alexander, Deputy Director of Education, Ernakulam, who is also the nodal officer of project Roshni.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/interactive-online-modules-keep-roshni-going/article33236264.ece
03 December 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||3 gallantry awardees do the Navy proud||The valour and indomitable spirit of three Naval officers who won gallantry awards - two who dared a fusillade of bullets from terrorists, and the third who commanded a ship which braved intense shelling to rescue the nationals of 40 countries from war-torn Middle East, are among the motivational stories that are being celebrated, as India readies to celebrate the golden jubilee of the country’s decisive victory over Pakistan in the 1971 war. All the three officers are serving at the Naval base in Kochi at present. Naval vessels bombarding the Karachi harbour on the night of December 4-5, 1971, was among the incidents that turned the tide in India’s favour. In 2000, Cmde. Varun Singh, then a Lieutenant, was the leader of Navy’s Marine Commando (Marcos) Force that was deployed for special operations in OP Rakshak in Jammu and Kashmir. On May 3 that year, his team killed four terrorists belonging to the hard core Al Badr gang. Though he was severely wounded, he returned to service with a bang after recuperating, despite doctors being sceptical of reviving him. He was awarded the Shaurya Chakra. Another Shaurya Chakra awardee, Capt. Milind Mohan Mokashi from Karnataka, as Commanding Officer of INS Sumitra, was leading anti-piracy operations when it was diverted for “Op Rahat” to evacuate Indian and foreign nationals from worn-torn Yemen in March-April 2015. He sailed the ship safely out of harbour in a navigationally unsafe channel, despite shelling and bombardment all around. His team evacuated 1,621 people, including 961 Indians, a few U.S. and Pakistani nationals from different ports of Yemen. Cdr. Vikrant Singh, a deep-sea diver with Marcos, had been at the forefront of several major operations in which a total of five hardcore terrorists were eliminated in J and K. In February 2019, he led an operation which led to the elimination of two LeT terrorists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/3-gallantry-awardees-do-the-navy-proud/article33236254.ece

The excise enforcement and narcotic special squad had seized the contraband hidden in small satchels in a carton containing rice powder, turmeric, and coriander powder from a courier firm in the city on November 24. It was originally sent from Kannur. Though the copy of an Aadhaar card of the sender had led excise officials to the house of a 23-year-old in Kannur, he was found to have been away from home for months, giving them the impression that someone else could have got hold of the card and used it to send the consignment. But since then officials have retracted and now suspect the youngster himself might have couriered it. “The mobile tower location traced him the day after the seizure to Punnamada Lake in Alappuzha where he might have been engaged in boating. We rushed there around 4.30 p.m. though he had landed on the shore and left just an hour before. He was finally traced to near the Alappuzha KSRTC stand after which the mobile phone had been switched off,” said a senior excise official. The excise now pins its hope on getting some throwaway leads from his call records although that looks remote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/excise-misses-drug-case-suspect-by-a-whisker/article33236262.ece

The new cases included 60 children and 72 persons aged above 60 years. With 33 cases, Madappally reported the highest number, followed by Kanjirappally and Kottayam with 30 cases each.

The promises made by the front include measures to ensure ease of traffic in the city. The manifesto released by Excise Minister T.P. Ramakrishnan on Wednesday proposes a flyover at Eranhipalam, more escalator overbridges for pedestrians on the lines of the one near the mofussil bus stand, purchase of road cleaning machines, and scientific alteration of major junctions. These are besides renewal of plans for a mobility hub, parking plazas, modern auto bays and taxi stands, and a state-of-the-art lorry stand. The manifesto also promises to bag the Smart City project. Modernisation of crematoriums and a comprehensive sewage system are some of the existing projects of the corporation that the front promises to complete. The setting up an international stadium and more playgrounds in the city has also been highlighted. The LDF plans major projects in view of the tourism prospects of the city. A plan to transform Kozhikode into a ‘city that never sleeps’, with round-the-clock entertainment facilities and food streets is one of them. Construction of a martyrs column on the beach, a museum featuring the history of the city at the old corporation office building, and an international convention centre have been listed. A promise to ensure that there are no homeless people in the city through various housing schemes completes the list.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-manifesto-offers-infra-development/article33235778.ece
03 December 2020||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||AIR listeners dispirited at losing local connect||Rajasree’s day begins with tuning into the Kozhikode station of All India Radio on her transistor. The homemaker would listen to the news, features, music and just about every programme. Her local AIR station has been keeping her informed as well as entertained, for decades. She was in for a shock a few days ago when she learned that the Kozhikode AIR station would cease to function as an independent entity. Prasar Bharati’s decision to stop producing programmes in multiple stations within a State has saddened many loyal listeners of AIR like her. If the decision is implemented, it would mean the end of the road for independent programming in all AIR stations in Kerala, except Thiruvananthapuram. At present, the Kozhikode, Thrissur, Kannur, Manjeri, Kochi and Devikulam stations have all their own independent identities. All those stations would have to carry programmes from Thiruvananthapuram. “The Prasar Bharati wants to have just one station for a State and that would kill the regional programmes that cater to large number of listeners. It is like a newspaper having one edition for the readers of entire Kerala,” a senior official told The Hindu . “It is all being done for the sake of cost cutting, but other options to make AIR financially viable need to be explored. Besides, AIR is basically a public service.”  Great service Stations like Kozhikode have been doing a great service to their audiences. Ever since it was established in 1950, AIR Kozhikode has been very much a vital part of the lives of the district and rest of Malabar. Programmes on both the primary and the Vividh Bharati stations of AIR Kozhikode are hugely popular. The Vividh Bharati station (Real FM) too is set to be downgraded; instead of its in-house programmes, it would have to relay the programmes from Thiruvananthapuram. Now, stations like Kozhikode and Thrissur would be allowed to produce programmes only for two hours a day and they would be relayed from Thiruvananthapuram. “It defeats the very purpose behind decentralising the AIR,” said Unnikrishnan Unithan, former Assistant Station Director, AIR, Thiruvananthapuram. “The new move from Prasar Bharati will also deprive local artistes of opportunities.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/air-listeners-dispirited-at-losing-local-connect/article33235850.ece

The police stopped them at the entrance to the building, where they staged a dharna. Interview for recruitment is held at the administrative block. Opening the protest, P. Abdul Hameed, MLA, said that the backward classes were being deprived of their constitutional benefits through the ongoing appointments. He claimed that people affiliated to the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) were being preferred for the posts. There had been widespread corruption too, Mr. Hameed alleged. Construction work worth crores of rupees was being handed over to Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society without the tender process. Student activists who staged protests against all these were being beaten up using the police, he said. Meanwhile, activists of the Fraternity Movement also staged a sit-in outside the building from the morning till they were removed by the police in the afternoon. K.K. Ashraf, secretary, Fraternity Movement, opened the protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/unions-protest-against-faculty-recruitment/article33235774.ece
03 December 2020||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Govt. setback in Periye case to be campaign highlight||The Supreme Court’s rejection of the State’s plea challenging the High Court's order for a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into murders of two Youth Congress workers at Periye in Kasaragod is seen as more than an embarrassment for the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government. The legal setback of the government will be summoned during the electioneering for local body polls to raise questions as to why it deployed big-ticket legal defence against the High Court order and leaves the State Police Chief (SPC) with the risk of facing contempt charges. The Crime Branch probe into the murder of Kripesh, 21, and Sarath Lal, 24, at Periye on February 17, 2019 came under a cloud when their parents filed a writ petition in the High Court on April 1 seeking to transfer the investigation to the CBI alleging that the probe was faulty. The court's order that the CBI would investigate the case 'forthwith in accordance with law' also directed the SPC to provide all support and facility to the CBI. ‘Culture of violence’ The issue was used by the United Democratic Front (UDF) during the Lok Sabha election last year to highlight what it called the CPI(M)’s culture of violence. The investigation appeared to be entangled in a legal battle as the government deployed lawyers from outside to challenge the High Court Single Bench order transferring the investigation to the CBI. A High Court Division Bench, on a writ appeal by the government, revived the chargesheet filed by the Crime Branch against the 14 accused, including local CPI(M) leaders and workers, but directed the CBI to conduct 'further investigation' and file supplementary report. According to legal circles, the SPC was put at risk of facing contempt charges when the parents filed contempt cases twice against the SPC, among others, for having not handed over the case diary to the CBI following the court orders. That was unusual, they say. It created an impression that the government was protecting the accused. That the government has spent a huge amount to pay the lawyers to defend its standhas helped strengthen that perception. The government reportedly spent nearly Rs. 1 crore from the exchequer to foot the bill for stalling the CBI probe. The UDF leadership has already sounded that the government’s setback would impact the upcoming local body elections, especially in Malabar, parts of which are affected by political violence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-setback-in-periye-case-to-be-campaign-highlight/article33235852.ece

The test positivity rate (TPR) was recorded at 13.03%. According to the District Medical Officer, there were 814 recoveries, and the active case load from the district dropped to 6,219. As many as 3,800 people are in home isolation. Of the newly infected, 694 contracted the virus through local transmission, and the source was unknown in 24 cases. Kozhikode Corporation had 120 cases of locally acquired infections, Koduvally 35, Kuruvattoor 33, Feroke and Kodiyathur 22 each, and Kadalundy and Koyilandy 20 each. In Wayanad Wayanad district saw the biggest spike ever in COVID-19 infection on Wednesday when 275 tested positive for the virus. District Medical Officer R. Renuka said that 271 of them acquired infection through local contact, and two each returned from abroad and other States. The public should be vigilant in the wake of the surge in the number of cases, Dr. Renuka said. The number of positive cases has doubled in a week. The sudden spurt in the inflow of tourists and the campaign for the civic body polls have increased the possibility of the pandemic spread further. Hence, the public, especially campaigners and tourists, should adhere to the COVID-19 protocol, she added. Admission of elderly people and patients with lifestyle diseases to intensive care units in most hospitals in the district has gone up considerably. Such a situation may lead to an increase in causality rate, Dr. Renuka reminded. COVID-19 testing was raised recently from 1,500 to 2,000 tests a day to contain the spread of the pandemic. The district has so far reported 11,170 cases, of which 9,665 have recovered, including 107 persons on Wednesday. In Malappuram When Malappuram recorded 822 new cases, 1,054 patients recovered from the disease on Wednesday. District officials said 65,913 persons had recovered, while 355 succumbed to the disease since March. While 764 of the new cases contracted the virus through direct contact, there were 45 cases without an identifiable source of infection. There were four health workers and nine who came from other States among the new cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/test-positivity-rate-remains-high-in-kozhikode/article33235784.ece
03 December 2020||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Railway rolls out new signal systems in Malabar||The Palakkad Division of the Southern Railway has begun the process of installing more signalling systems in north Kerala to improve the speed of trains in the sector. R. Bhaskaran, Principal Chief Signal and Telecommunications Engineer, Southern Railway, inspected a new Intermediate Block Section (IBS) at Mahe railway station last week. On commissioning, the facility will be helpful for operations in a larger way, officials said. At present, an express train from Mahe to Vadakara takes 10 minutes to clear the section. For passenger and goods trains, it takes 12 to 14 minutes. Once IBS is rolled out at Mahe and Vadakara, an express train will take less than five minutes to proceed from Mahe to Vadakara or vice versa. In the case of passenger and goods trains, it will be six to seven minutes. The IBS facility was in the final stage of execution, officials said.  Operational efficiency To improve operational efficiency, the Palakkad Division had commissioned an IBS between Tikkotti and Vadakara in September last week. The signalling arrangement introduced in the section bifurcates the 12.61-km-long block section between Tikkotti and Vadakara. This helps in avoiding detention of trains on both sides, besides ensuring punctuality and enhancing line capacity in the section. Prior to the introduction of IBS, express trains took 10 minutes, while passenger trains took 18 minutes (including stoppage time at the two halt stations in the section), whereas goods trains required 13 minutes to pass through the section between Tikkotti and Vadakara. Officials said that the IBS facility between Tikkotti and Vadakara was the sixth in the division. It is available on Kanjikode - Walayar (in B-line ghat section), Palakkad Junction - Parli, Parli -Lakkidi, Payyannur - Charvattur, Kanhangad - Kottikulam and Kumbla - Manjeswaram sections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/railway-rolls-out-new-signal-systems-in-malabar/article33236376.ece
03 December 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Order on inspection of disputed EFL may be revoked||An earlier order of the State government to accord sanction for conducting a joint inspection in 219.5 acres of disputed land at Kavilumpara village under Vadakara taluk, which was notified as Ecologically Fragile Land (EFL) several years ago, is likely to be revoked following a controversy. A high-level meeting chaired by Forest Minister K. Raju was held in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday to review the move and discuss the complaints against the order, which was issued on the basis of a representation submitted by Abhirami Plantations and Resorts Private Ltd. The main allegation against the order from various corners was that it was an attempt to give back the disputed land to the owners after clearing the EFL tag with the illegal formation of a joint inspection team. Those who opposed it had also quoted the Accounts General’s (AG) report that any dispute related to EFL land could be challenged only at the Kerala High Court or the Supreme Court. A senior Forest Department officer said the meeting was held to discuss the experts’ opinion on the order. “The final decision was to leave it to the consideration of the court without conducting any joint inspection,” he told The Hindu . The controversial order on November 3, 2020 had recommended the formation of a five-member committee. The Additional Chief Conservator of Forest had been entrusted with coordinating the inspection. However, the plan to include a representative of the plantation company as the fifth member in the team had triggered protests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/order-on-inspection-of-disputed-efl-may-be-revoked/article33235838.ece

C.E. Chakkunny, president of the confederation, said that people were crowding in long-distance buses in the absence of enough train services, which could lead to further spread of the pandemic. The association appreciated the decision to restart the services such as Mangaluru-Thiruvananthapuram, Chennai-Mangaluru, Chennai-Thiruvananthapuram and Chennai-Palakkad services. However, stopping the service of Kannur-Yeshwanthpur train due to lack of passengers was not appreciated. Hardship for passengers Besides, the timing of major trains that start from Delhi had been changed and they would reach Kerala at midnight. Also, stops had been cut short. This would cause further problems to passengers who got stranded at railway stations. The confederation said that the absence of long distance trains within the State, lack of passenger-MEMU services for short journeys, absence of pantry cars, senior citizens being denied their benefits, continuation of restrictions of the lockdown period and non-availability of eateries or drinking water in even major stations, were the reasons for poor patronage of the services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-to-resume-long-distance-trains/article33235785.ece

03 December 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Periye, Walayar cases will impact polls, says Chandy||The upcoming local body polls will see people’s response to the State government for its lapses in the Periye case involving the murder of two Youth Congress activists and the Walayar case involving the alleged rape and death of two minor girls, former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy has said. Addressing a ‘Meet the Leader’ event organised by the Calicut Press Club here on Wednesday, the Congress leader said that the government had not been sympathetic to the feelings of the parents of Kripesh and Sarath Lal, the murdered activists. Mr. Chandy also accused the government of spending crores of rupees to hire lawyers to challenge the parents’ demand for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the incident in the High Court and later the Supreme Court. The apex court ruling in favour of a CBI probe was a “huge setback”, he said. Mr. Chandy pointed out that the Walayar case too was shoddily handled, as the parents of the girls were not provided a copy of the post-mortem examination report when one of the siblings were found dead. Nobody had been arrested too. The government is opposing a CBI probe in this case as well, he alleged. Asked about the ongoing cases registered against Opposition leaders, Mr. Chandy claimed that at least some of them, such as the one against former Minister V.K. Ibrahim Kunju, would prove to be a setback to the government. He claimed that 30% of work on the Palarivattom flyover in Kochi had been completed during the tenure of the LDF government, who had showcased it as one of its achievements. It should be noted that the contractor who constructed the flyover had not procured the completion certificate. Why was the government not willing to conduct a road test despite court directions, Mr. Chandy asked. He said that the allegations against Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala too were not new. Probes conducted earlier had cleared him of all charges, and there had not been any new revelation. “The government is trying to divert attention from various controversies surrounding it. It is also aimed at targeting Mr. Chennithala, who had been exposing many wrong-doings of the government,” Mr. Chandy added. ‘No alliance’ The former Chief Minister clarified that the UDF would not have any alliance with parties outside the coalition for the local body polls. He was responding to questions on the Congress party’s reported tactical understanding with the Jamaat-e-Islami-supported Welfare Party of India in Mukkom Municipality of Kozhikode. He said the political affairs committee of the Congress had decided against any truck with parties outside the UDF, which was endorsed by other allies as well. When pointed out that the UDF did not have candidates in some wards where the WPI had fielded its nominees, the Congress leader said he would find out if that was the case. The party will discuss issues raised by K. Muraleedharan, MP, over candidate selection for Kallamala division in Kozhikode block panchayat, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/periye-walayar-cases-will-impact-polls-chandy/article33235776.ece

Balan alleged here on Wednesday that the United Democratic Front (UDF) made alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami to take on the Left Democratic Front (LDF). He said the UDF and the BJP had common candidates in many wards in 20-odd panchayats in the district. “The UDF has gone for an unholy nexus because they cannot stop the LDF in direct fight,” he said. According to Mr. Balan, there is dissent within the UDF and the BJP about this alliance. “That is why the UDF has rebel candidates in Palakkad and Pattambi municipalities.” He warned that the people would give a fitting reply to “this ignoble alliance” and the LDF would stage a better performance than in the last elections. The LDF will hold ‘development proclamation’ programmes at all panchayats on Thursday evening by involving the beneficiaries of State government schemes. A State-wide webinar rallies will be organised on Saturday. Mr. Balan said that 50 lakh people were expected to attend the webinar rallies to be held from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. at booth level. The LDF had won 69 out of the 88 grama panchayats and two out of seven municipalities in the district in the last election. He said the condition of Palakkad, Mannarkkad and Chittur municipalities, where the BJP and the Congress were in rule, was pathetic. “Both fronts are awaiting a backlash in those municipalities,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/balan-alleges-udf-nexus-with-bjp-jamat/article33235782.ece

CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan said with a seemingly abrupt finality that the matter was a closed chapter. When pressed whether the party had censured Dr. Isaac and CPI(M) State secretariat member Anathalavattom Anandan for their pronouncements on the “undesirability” of the raid, Mr. Vijayraghavan said “the party communique is self-evident”. Mr. Vijayaraghavan’s position was interpreted widely as a rejection of Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac’s averment on Tuesday that he would broach the issue in the party after the elections. Dr. Isaac and Mr. Anandan had adopted the position that the Vigilance, headed by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, should have kept the Finance Minister in the loop about the inspections.  The leaders reportedly came under criticism in the CPI(M) secretariat for providing ammunition to the Opposition to insinuate that the Home and Finance Departments were at odds with each other. The Congress and the BJP had decoded the statements as an insurrection against Mr. Vijayan in the party and government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-disinclined-to-revisit-vacb-controversy/article33235841.ece

03 December 2020||Thrissur,KERALA||Pink bloom a threat to waterbodies, says KFRI||Pink bloom, which emerged as a recent tourist attraction at Avalappandi Canal of Cheruvannur panchayat (near Perambra in Kozhikode), has become a major threat to the fresh waterbodies in Kerala, a research team of Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI), has observed. The cause of the instant tourist interest is a flowering invasive alien species, Red Cabomba ( Cabombafurcata ), a submerged perennial aquatic plant that grows in stagnant to slow-flowing freshwater. Native to Central and south America, Cabomba is a common aquarium plant with beautiful flowers and excellently dissected leaves. International aquarium industry has been introducing them to areas outside of its native range. “Cabomba has caused the decrease in the diversity of native aquatic plants and has also caused economic losses by affecting the yield of freshwater fish. Cabomba prefers nutrient-rich freshwaterbodies. They are capable of fast spreading by propagation of stem fragments and form dense stands in waterbodies that will outnumber native plants. This aquatic plant has a high natural dispersal potential owing to its ability to readily fragment and spread both actively and passively,” said T.V. Sajeev, Senior Principal Scientist, KFRI, who led a research team to study the issue. The invasion of Cabomba will choke ecologically and economically important waterbodies and drainage canals. It requires a large quantity of oxygen for its growth, which results in decline of biodiversity and affects the water quality. The key to controlling the species is to mechanically remove the plants from the waterbody and drying them in terrestrial spaces.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pink-bloom-a-threat-to-waterbodies-says-kfri/article33235773.ece

Compared to the private dairies, the Amul Dairy project has come out with a competitive price to the farmers.

03 December 2020||MACHILIPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Attack on Minister: police start grilling suspects||The Krishna district police are questioning the suspects and the family members of Badugu Nageswara Rao, who attacked Transport Minister Perni Venkataramaiah (Nani), on November 29. The accused, a mason of the town, attacked the Minister with a trowel at his residence on the pretext of touching his feet. The police are observing the CCTV footages on the day when the mason attacked the Minister. They are also retrieving the mobile phone call data of the accused before he resorted to the attack. “Nageswara Rao attacked the Minister in a planned manner. He tried to stab with the trowel in the stomach, but the tool hit the belt buckle. When he failed in his first attempt, the accused tried to stab for the second time,” a police officer said. The alert Minister pushed Nageswara Rao away, and the security personnel and party workers immediately pounced on the accused and took him into custody. The accused followed the Minister for some time before he resorted to the attack. When Mr. Nani was participating in his mother’s 13th day ceremony at his residence, Nageswara Rao came close to the Minister and tried to execute his plan, an investigation officer said. Political enmity suspected “We suspect that political enmity was one of the reason for the attack. We are trying to find out whether any other motive was behind the incident,” said Superintendent of Police M. Ravindranath Babu. Nageswara Rao was a Telugu Desam Party supporter and his sister B. Umadevi was the TDP district vice-president. Police are planning to question the family members of the accused and some party activists in the case. “The mason was not in a drunken state and he resorted to the offence with some grudge. We will find out the exact reason for the attack,” an officer monitoring the investigation of the case said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/attack-on-minister-police-start-grilling-suspects/article33236405.ece

Police were clueless soon after registering a case on November 17, based on a report from the Village Revenue Officer of Gangavaram village, near Pullalcheru, as the assailants after allegedly committing the murder of a 32-year-old man on November 16, had reportedly consigned the body to flames after dousing it with petrol and dissolved the ashes in Nagarjunasagar project canal to wipe out the evidence, Yerrogondapalem Circle Inspector P. Deva Prabakar said on Wednesday. SP Siddharth Kaushal formed three teams under the Markapur DSP M. Kishore Kumar. A thorough probe into the case and vital clues picked up from the crime spot by technology assistants paved the way for a breakthrough. Police zeroed in on 36-year-old Brahma Reddy, brother-in-law of the victim K. Subba Reddy, with whom the former reportedly had differences over financial matters. Intense interrogation of the accused persons and a friend of the deceased helped the police unravel the modus operandi and motive behind the murder of Subba Reddy when the latter was consuming liquor along with the friend. Police recovered four mobile phones of the accused persons, motorcycle used by the deceased as also a gold ring of the latter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/technology-helps-police-crack-murder-case/article33236304.ece

Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (Amendment) Bill, 2020, paving the way for additional borrowing space of 2% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) for the financial year 2020-21 over and above the normal permissible limit of 3% of the GSDP. Explaining the necessity to amend the A.P. Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2005, in the Assembly, Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy said that the amendment was being made to implement the guidelines of the Finance Commission. In fact, the amendments should have been made in 2015-16. The old and new amendments were incorporated in the Bill, he said. The Minister said that the Central government had permitted the additional borrowing space, subject to implementation of specific State Level Reforms and carrying out necessary amendments to the FRBM Act. During 2019-20, due to lower realisation of tax revenues, the Centre could not devolve taxes as promised. Also, the State government required more fiscal space for allocation to healthcare, to deal with the pandemic and address the gaps in health sector, he said. Accordingly, the Act was amended. For the financial years from 2015-16 to 2020-21, the fiscal deficit shall not be more than 5% of the GSDP, including one-time additional borrowing of Rs. 2,534 crore permitted by the Central government for the year 2019-20. It included 2% of the GSDP additional borrowing permitted for the year 2020-21 in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, he said, adding that the outstanding total liabilities should not exceed 35% of the estimated GSDP for the financial years from 2015-16 to 2020-21.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/frbm-amendment-bill-2020-passed/article33236315.ece

Taking out a rally near the Legislative Assembly near here on Wednesday, the party MLAs and MLCs, led by their national president and Leader of the Opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu, demanded that the government reach out to them by providing them assistance. Holding placards and raising slogans against what they termed as “18 months of misrule of the YSRCP government,” the party leaders demanded implementation of the free sand policy rolled out by the TDP government to create livelihood opportunities for the workers. In a symbolic protest to highlight the plight of the workers, Mr. Naidu carried a trowel and a cement pail on his head. Suicides TDP Legislature Party Deputy Leader K. Atchannaidu said that many construction workers were forced to take the extreme step because of the severe crisis into which the YSRCP had pushed the construction sector in the State. “The suicide of construction workers should be treated as murders committed by the government,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-failed-to-reach-out-to-construction-workers-tdp/article33236116.ece

03 December 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Indian Oil Corporation Limited to invest Rs. 1,689 crore in State||To meet the growing demand for petroleum products, including petrol, diesel and LPG in the State, Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) is set to invest Rs. 1,689 crore to develop infrastructure and expand its distribution network, according to IOCL executive director and head of AP and Telangana R.S.S. Rao. At a press conference here on Wednesday, Mr. Rao, along with Chief General Manager Phani Rammohan, and General Manager R. Chidambaram revealed the projects taken up and lined up for commissioning in the next couple of years. He said out of the total investment, Rs. 1,522 crore would be invested in petro products infrastructure and Rs. 167 crore in Liquid Petroleum Gas. Some of the projects were already taken up. Mr. Rao said the existing Vijayawada Terminal at Kondapalli, which would operate as Tap Off Point Terminal for the Paradip-Hyderabad Pipeline (PHPL), would be revamped and the storage capacity increased at a cost of Rs. 316 crore by September 2021. The PHPL, spanning over 1,200 km from Paradip in Odisha to Hyderabad covers 723 km in AP and was nearing completion, he said. “Another Tap Off Point Terminal for PHPL, a grassroots terminal, is coming up in over 60 acres of area at Atchutapuram, Visakhapatnam, at a cost of Rs. 466 crore and with a storage capacity of over 74,000 km. The terminal will cater to the needs of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts and is expected to be completed by July 2021,” he said. While the supply of all-white oils would be gradually shifted to the new terminal from the existing Malkapuram terminal, black oil supply would continue as it is going to be revamped with Rs. 355 crore by February 2023, he added. Mr. Rao said that demand for LPG has been growing and IndianOil has LPG market share of 35.5% in cooking gas with a sale of 2,59,000 metric tonnes (TMTs) during 2020-21 in the State as it serves 49 lakh customers. Bottling plant In addition to the three Indane LPG bottling plants at Kadapa, Visakhapatnam and Kondapalli which can churn out one lakh cylinders a day, a new bottling plant at a cost of Rs. 167 crore would be set up in Chittoor. The new plant would increase the bottling capacity to near 1.4 lakh cylinders per day in the state, Mr. Rao said. Also, a new rail fed depot costing Rs. 385 crore is coming up in Nakkanadoddi, Guntakal, with a tankage capacity of 55,000 kilolitres and it is likely to be commissioned by March 2021. As part of its plan to set up 1,291 new retail outlets in the State during the last year, IOCL has called applications and received only 1,139 responses after which letter of intent for opening 346 outlets was issued recently. A total of 1,413 retail outlets are operational in the State currently. The corporation is also focused on piped gas distribution to households and industries and city gas distribution. Compressed Biogas dispensing facility, first of its kind venture, in Produtur in Kadapa would be inaugurated during December, said the executive director.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/indian-oil-corporation-limited-to-invest-rs-1689-crore-in-state/article33235653.ece

State Agricultural Council Bill, 2020. With this, Andhra Pradesh will be the first State in the country to establish such a body. Explaining the features of the Bill, Agriculture Minister K. Kannababu said the Agricultural Council would be an autonomous body. It would function on the lines of the medical, dental and nursing councils. All the activities pertaining to agriculture graduates, entrepreneurs, extension, research, development and marketing would come under one roof through it, he said. The Minister said that the Agricultural Council was a long-pending demand. The Central government too wanted to set up a national council. But it was not possible unless at least five States established State-level councils, he said. “Andhra Pradesh is taking the lead now,” he added. ‘Norms being prepared’ “The guidelines and modalities of the proposed council are being prepared. Agriculture graduates can register themselves with the council. An identity number will be given to them. They can do private practice as well. Malpractices, unlawful and unethical practices will not be tolerated. The registration of those violating the norms will be cancelled, and they will be debarred from doing practice,” the Minister said. Mr. Kannababu said that there were many private agricultural colleges in the State without any recognition. “Many colleges do not have 10 acres land despite collecting hefty donations,” he said. When the government planned to recruit village assistants, many graduates who had passed out from these unrecognised colleges wanted to take up the job, the Minister said. “The colleges, universities, and research stations will be brought under the ambit of the council to streamline agriculture education, research and development,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-has-taken-the-lead-in-setting-up-agriculture-council-says-kannababu/article33236311.ece

Explaining the objectives of making amendments to the Assigned Lands (Prohibition and Transfers) Act, Deputy Chief Minister and Revenue Minister Dharmana Krishna Das said that the farmers, who give the land on lease voluntarily, would be paid Rs. 25,000 per annum as rent per acre. The Bill triggered allegations and counter-allegations between the Treasury and Opposition benches. The TDP alleged that the government was forcibly taking away the assigned lands from the poor and Dalits, who had been cultivating the lands for several years. Various laws had been passed by the successive governments to protect the undeniable rights of the poor over the assigned lands, they said. ‘Charges baseless’ Refuting the charges, Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy said the TDP was diverting the issue by alleging that the lands were being taken forcibly. Even as the Bill was being passed, the TDP MLAs staged a walkout demanding the government withdraw the Bill in order to prevent injustice to the weaker sections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/assembly-adopts-bill-on-assigned-lands/article33236312.ece

Addressing the media, Mr. Naidu said Polavaram was a national project and the YSRCP had no moral right to do whatever it wanted, as the State government was not spending a single rupee on it. “Has the government convinced the Centre on the statue?” he asked. The TDP chief objected to the “reckless manner” in which the YSRCP government had proposed to spend over Rs. 200 crore on the statue of former Chief Minister. Apparently, the Chief Minister was only interested in the statue but not the actual project that had the potential to serve the long-term interests of the State, he added.

Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, Mr. Naidu urged the State government to specify by which time it would be able to complete the remaining 30% Polavaram works. The government should come clean on the extent of land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement package it was going to give to the project evacuees, including a time-frame for it, he said. “The government admitted that 69.54% dam works were completed under the previous regime by 2019. The project design, approvals, grouting and all main works were completed already. Only the superstructure works were remaining. Still, the government could complete just 2% works. The ruling party and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy were only interested in playing ugly politics with no commitment and no accountability. How can the government cancel the contract and appoint a new contractor?” he asked. If Mr. Jagan did not go for reverse tendering with his perverse ideas, the Polavaram works would have been completed way back in 2019 itself.

Jagan Mohan Reddy to take up with the Centre the issue of extending implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). In a letter addressed to the Chief Minister, the organisation’s founder member B. Ramakrishna Raju and co-convenor Chakradhar Buddhaurged Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy to pass a resolution in the Assembly in this regard. They said supply of edible oil and pulses should be included for each beneficiary of the scheme and pointed out that the estimates of available stocks with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) indicated that it was feasible to both universalise the Public Distribution System (PDS) and simultaneously extend the PMGKAY for at least another six months. Free ration distribution under the scheme expired in November 2020. Under this scheme, persons with a ‘priority’ or Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) ration card under the National Food Security Act (2013) receive additional 5 kgs of grain per person and each household gets 1 kg of chana for free. Food Security Act The members said that the Central programme is needed to support the poor listed under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and that it would help them cope with the economic distress caused due to the COVID-19-induced lockdown. Currently, more than 1.5 crore families are benefiting from the scheme in the State. They said their field observations indicated that a large number of people were still grappling with uncertainties over livelihood and unemployment. Mid-Day Meal scheme During the lockdown, dry ration was supplied to the families of children who were benefiting from the Mid-Day Meal scheme. But it has been discontinued after opening of schools. Stating that more than 30% of children were not attending schools due to pandemic scare, they said these kids were deprived of the MDM.

03 December 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Withdraw G.O. on property tax: CPI(M)||The CPI(M) city committee has demanded withdrawal of a G.O. under which property tax would henceforth be assessed based on the value of the property. The activists burnt a copy of the G.O. issued by the YSRCP government, at a protest opposite the GVMC Office here on Wednesday. City Committee secretariat member R.K.S.V. Kumar said that the State government’s ordinance would put undue burden on the common man. Demanding withdrawal of the ordinance, Mr. Kumar sought that 50% concession in property tax should be given to the people in view of the crisis due to the pandemic, as was being done in Telangana. The move to hike taxes, based on property values, would not only cause undue burden on homeowners but also result in annual hike in property tax, when property values are revised, causing burden on house owners as well as tenants. They alleged that the State government had hiked the tax on the orders of the Centre. CPI(M) leader and former corporator Botta Eswaramma said that many people in Visakhapatnam had lost their jobs or suffered loss in income due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She recalled that the Congress and Telugu Desam governments were forced to suffer the wrath of the public in the past when they had hiked property tax, and warned of agitations if the hike was not rolled back. CPI(M) City secretariat member B. Padma, leaders B. Jagan, P. Mani, M. Subba Rao, V. Krishna Rao, B. Suryamani and RP Raju participated in the protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpim-demands-withdrawal-of-go-on-property-tax-hike/article33236354.ece
03 December 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||High Court dismisses writs filed by mining company||The Andhra Pradesh Hight Court has dismissed three writ petitions filed by Stone Plus company and upheld the action of the Forest Department in its orders passed on November 25. The court observed that the mining was conducted in forest land in an extent of 5.33 hectares on Somalamma hill and upheld the Forest Department’s claim that the mining led to financial loss of around Rs. 3.05 crore, excavation of 43,772.16 cubic metres of granite and loss to biodiversity in the area. Stone Plus had obtained a mining licence and had started mining operations in 2016 on the hill near the Kalyanapulova reservoir. Since 2017, local tribals and farmers of Kalyanapulova have been urging the government to conduct an enquiry and cancel the mining licence granted to the firm. They claimed that in 1986, Somalamma hill was notified as a Reserve Forest (RF) under the Forest Act and named as Cheemalapadu Forest Block. But new revenue survey numbers were created to facilitate a mining licence, which was in violation of forest laws, the tribals alleged. The tribals brought to the notice of the authorities the fact that the mining company had not only conducted excavations atop the hill, which is a notified RF, but has also disturbed the catchment area of the reservoir. When the company received notices from Irrigation, Mining and Forest Departments, they filed three cases in the High Court. Subsequently, the Forest Department stopped the mining operations in May this year. When the company tried to take away the granite and vehicles from the mining site, local tribals objected and protested. The Forest Department had filed a criminal case against the company in October. The High Court had passed an order for a joint survey on October 20, this year. In the joint survey, it was clearly established the mining operation was carried out in the forest area. This report was placed before the Court. Based on the report, the High Court has dismissed the cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/high-court-dismisses-writs-filed-by-mining-company/article33236416.ece
03 December 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Regularise health workers’ services: PAV||Praja Arogya Vedika (PAV) has appealed to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to regularise the services of medical and health personnel who were recruited on a contract basis to work at hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a letter to the Chief Minister on Wednesday, PAV general secretary T. Kameswara Rao and president M.V. Ramanaiah sought re-employment of all medical and health personnel, who have been removed from duty, after the decline of COVID-19 cases in the State. While commending the State government for taking immediate steps to improve medical health services to curb the pandemic, they said that the contract staff had rendered yeoman services when the pandemic was at its peak. Their contribution towards checking the spread of COVID-19 was commendable, they said. The PAV leaders noted that the experience of the world community shows that there is a need to strengthen the medical and health services in the wake of warnings from experts, doctors and scientists that a second wave of the pandemic was likely in India as well. They felt that dismissal of contract personnel by the State government was not the right course of action. The move could further weaken the public health system as well as erode public confidence in the government. The Centre is gearing up for a nationwide vaccination campaign as soon as the vaccine is available, the leaders said. The State would require a large number of medical workers for the effective implementation of the vaccination programme. The PAV leaders urged the government to recruit all the contract medical and health personnel, who have gained vast experience, under ‘permanent category’ and to engage them on duty immediately.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pav-urges-regularisation-of-health-workers-jobs/article33236352.ece

03 December 2020||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Welfare policy sought for differently-abled persons||Thousands of differently-abled persons have been enduring misery since the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic, lockdown and other reasons. Facing difficulties in mobility, they are craving for care with many of their family members failing to cater to their needs owing to either drop in the income sources or loss of livelihood altogether due to the virus-induced lockdown and economic slowdown. The differently-abled people have also lost their sources of income for the same reasons. As per government records, nearly 8 lakh people fall under differently-abled category in the State. Apart from various diseases including polio, accidents have made them dependent on others and the pandemic has compounded the problems. On the eve of International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which is observed on December 3 every year, they have urged the government to come with an exclusive policy to ensure a decent life and livelihood for them. “It is very hard to get a job for physically-challenged persons. The government pensions, self-employment schemes and other welfare programmes cover only 20%of the differently-abled people. The government must take up a study on their grievances and come up an exclusive policy to help the differently-abled people lead their life with honour,” said P. Yesudasu, president of Viziangaram District Vikalangula Hakkula Parirakshana Sangham. Sri Gurudeva Charitable Trust (Mangalapalem-Kothavalasa mandal) founder Raparthi Jagadish Babu, who has distributed prosthetic limbs to nearly 71,000 persons in the last two decades, suggested that the government should set up small-scale industries exclusively for the physically-challenged people. Small-scale industries “The government can announce incentives for entrepreneurs who come forward to establish small and medium scale industries. It can also design skill development programmes for the differently-abled persons,” he added. K. Ramalakshmi of L. Kota and M. Chellayamm of Vepada, both differently-abled, urged the government to establish food processing units in villages so that it would easy for them to get livelihood locally. “It is very difficult to get jobs in villages and mandal headquarters. We need to travel long distances to get even a small job. The amount we earn is not sufficient given the skyrocketing prices of essential commodities,” said K. Ramalakshmi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/welfare-policy-sought-for-differently-abled-persons/article33236351.ece

They staged a walk-out before the marshals carried them away, and Mr. Naidu and a few other MLAs followed them as a mark of protest. Intervening in a short discussion on irrigation projects (including Polavaram) and reverse tendering in the Assembly, Mr. Jagan said the entire credit for securing the site, forest, environmental, wildlife, R&R, technical and investment clearances and convincing the Supreme Court to allow denotification of the Papikonda reserve forest to facilitate the project (Polavaram) goes to the Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy government. A substantial part of the physical progress over the years was also achieved during Rajasekhara Reddy’s regime, the Chief Minister claimed, while making a mockery of Mr. Naidu for spending roughly Rs. 90 crore on ferrying gullible people to the project and meeting the incidental expenses to show off the minuscule progress recorded by his government. ‘Negligence’ Mr. Jagan said the TDP government’s gross negligence in implementing R&R packages under Chitravathi balancing reservoir, Pulichintala, Gandikota, Veligonda, Kandaleru and many other projects was evident from the plight of lakhs of displaced people and the present government’s unenviable job of clearing the mess created by Mr. Naidu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/centre-willing-to-rectify-lapses-in-calculating-polavaram-cost/article33236309.ece

03 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||COVID alert: politicos, cadre urged to isolate for a week||Public representatives, political leaders and party cadre, who participated in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections for campaigning and polling, were urged by the Telangana Health department to isolate themselves for a week to contain possible spread of coronavirus. As politicians and party cadre interacted closely with people, there is a chance for the infectious disease to spread further if asymptomatic virus carriers, who did not take precautions, were part of the rallies or other events, the Health officials pointed out. It was observed during the civic election rallies that COVID-19 appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks and physical distancing was not maintained. Though it was anticipated that the cases might surge after a few festivals were celebrated in the past few months, the State has been fortunate not to record a spike. However, the GHMC election process witnessed huge gatherings, which could be a possible source for a surge. Besides, the temperatures have dropped that are quite favourable for the virus to thrive. At a press conference held at the State Health campus on Wednesday, Director of Public Health Dr. G. Srinivasa Rao, who requested politicians and party cadre to isolate themselves for a week to avoid second wave of COVID in the State, asked them not to step out unless it was a medical emergency. He said that it takes five to seven days to develop symptoms and if any of them have COVID and mingle with family members or others, there is a chance for the virus to spread further leading to a second wave of COVID. “If any of you develop symptoms, please get tested at government health facilities,” he said. Health department officials have been cautioning about a second wave if precautions are not maintained. Dr. Srinivasa Rao added that cases were surging in European nations, and in other states in India. The official also said that cases have increased in Jagtial because of a marriage and in a market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/covid-alert-politicos-cadre-urged-to-isolate-for-a-week/article33236219.ece
03 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Wards in Old City, too, record low turnout||Wards in the Old City recorded low polling, a trend which was witnessed in several other wards across Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits. The lowest polling percentage was witnessed in Santoshnagar (Ward 39), which recorded 35.95%. While some voters said that they stayed away and opined that the victory of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) was imminent, some others said that they were unhappy with the governance. “They will win in any case. Many of their corporators and sometimes, MLAs are available. And the other thing is that there is no opposition to the MIM,” said M A Kareem (name changed), a voter of Chandrayangutta (Ward 41), who works at an eatery in Banjara Hills. “There is a feeling that whatever happens, ‘our’ party will win.” Much like in other parts of the city, the flooding of neighbourhoods, and the fact that flood relief did not reach several people, as admitted by AIMIM leaders in the run up to the civic polls, played a part in a section of the voters staying away. “There was some resentment in Hafiz Baba Nagar area. There are many people I know who did not vote because of the flooding. Government relief has not reached some of the people there,” said Mohammed Abood. Several wards such as Rein Bazaar, Talabchanchalam, Kurmaguda and Pathergatti recorded a polling percentage of over 40%. Others such as Shalibanda, Ghansi Bazaar and Riyasatnagar recorded a polling percentage over 50%. The highest percentage was seen in Nawabsahebkunta with 55.65%. “The polling percentage is comparable to 2009 and 2016. There is just a little variance,” a senior AIMIM party functionary said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/wards-in-old-city-too-record-low-turnout/article33236226.ece
03 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||State intensifies bid to raise resources||The State government has intensified its efforts to mobilise resources for meeting its immediate financial commitments, thanks to the bleak prospects of improvement in the revenues during the current financial year. The government has raised Rs. 4,500 crore in the form of state development loans as part of the open market borrowings through the Reserve Bank of India – Rs. 3,500 crore in three tranches in November and another Rs. 1,000 crore in the auction conducted on December 1. One of the primary commitments before the State government in the immediate future is crediting the next instalment of Rs. 5,000 an acre into the accounts of over 59 lakh farmers for the Yasangi (rabi season). In spite of the financial difficulties it was faced with, the government successfully credited the Rythu Bandhu instalment for Kharif in the third week of June following the instructions of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. Farmers are anxiously waiting for the announcement on the Yasangi instalment of Rythu Bandhu for taking up cropping for this season. Simultaneously, the government has communicated its acceptance for Option -1 of the two options suggested by the Union Finance Ministry to meet the shortfall in revenue arising out of Goods and Service Tax (GST) implementation. The Centre had extended the option a few months ago, but the State accepted one of the options after elaborate deliberations with experts. In the process, it had joined 22 other States and three Union Territories that have accepted Option-1. In addition to getting the facility of a special window for borrowings to meet the shortfall arising out of the GST implementation, the first option allows the State to get unconditional permission to borrow the financial instalment of 0.5% of GSDP out of the 2 % additional borrowings permitted under the Atmanirbhar Abhiyan by the Centre. The State opted for 30 year tenure for all the special development loans obtained from the RBI unlike in the past when it opted for shorter periods of five and 10 years. The State received appreciation from the Centre for its planning of short tenure OMBs, but the pattern had undergone a change since July from when the State had opted for 30 year tenure for all, but one, tranches of the state development loans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-intensifies-bid-to-raise-resources/article33236238.ece
03 December 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Ad spend on social media increases||The ad spend for the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections was not limited to newspapers, buntings, pamphlets, and banners but also included online ads hosted on social media sites. Even on December 1, when a few voters were stirring to go for voting, Chintala Vijayshanti Reddy was promising them: “Vow to be available 24/7 for #alwaldivision134 people be it development or for any natural calamities. Please #VoteForTRS to serve you all again.” For Rs. 3,334 she was able to reach about 60,000 people on the social media. BJP candidate Boini Anusha Yadav from Hafeezpet spent Rs. 28,359 for an ad that ran till hours before polling began. She was not the only one. Other candidates too used social media to reach out to voters even after the end of canvassing. The candidates for GHMC elections are allowed to spend up to Rs. 5 lakh for campaigning. According to data hosted on Facebook Ad Library, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi candidates and their backers posted about 80 ads while the Bharatiya Janata Party came close second with 44 ads. The ads hosted by other political parties’ numbers were in single digits. This election also saw guerilla marketing with big spending. One Page called ‘Kya Hua KTR’ popped up on November 18, a day after the announcement of GHMC elections. Another called ‘Hyderabad rejects TRS’ was created on November 23 and the pages have become inactive since. Both of these were sponsored by someone called Naveen Chandra Kalla. While paid ads are being tracked, posts by followers and non-political entities are out of the ambit of political expenses giving a big leeway to candidates. While Facebook and Instagram have an ad library allowing the expense of the candidates to be tracked, Twitter has disallowed political ads. This has however not stopped politicos from using the micro-blogging site to spread their message or challenge the rival candidates. As the countdown begins for the counting day of December 4, it remains to be seen how the social media spending helped the candidates spread their message.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ad-spend-on-social-media-increases/article33236224.ece
03 December 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP demands re-poll in two GHMC divisions||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) urged the State Election Commission (SEC) to hold a re-poll in several polling stations of Ghansi Bazaar - 49 and Puranapul - 52 divisions complaining of large-scale rigging during polling on Tuesday. City president and MLC N. Ramchander Rao, election cell in charge K. Anthony Reddy and others on Wednesday met SEC C. Parthasarathi at his chambers and gave a written complaint claiming massive rigging in polling stations of 1-19 of Ghansi Bazaar division and in the polling stations of 3, 4, 5 and 38-45 of Puranapul by Majlis followers giving a boost to the poll percentage to 90%. The Bharatiya Janata Party leaders pointed out that when the general voting percentage was about 35-40%, it was strange that the poll authorities did not see anything amiss when a high poll percentage was registered in these particular polling stations. The party had approached the High Court upon which orders were issued for more security presence in these ‘sensitive’ polling stations. Despite the State Election Commissioner (SEC) specifically issuing orders directing the polling officers and police personnel to be impartial in their duty and not give scope for charges of partisanship, the security personnel have been silent to the massive rigging when even the poll personnel were sent out, they charged.

03 December 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Follow Punjab example, Kodandaram tells farmers||Telangana Jana Samiti (TJS) president M. Kodandaram has opined that the GHMC elections were used as a platform for strengthening their political power over Telangana rather than debating on the issues related to the city like crumbling infrastructure to meet people’s needs. At a press conference here, he said the projection of national issues over the local issues led to disinterest among the voters and it was time political parties introspected on the low voters turn out despite the educated voters increasing. Moreover, no effort was made to make the citizens participate in the process as concentration was more on politics than increasing voting percentage. Extending support to the farmers’ agitating against the new farm bills passed by the government, Mr. Kodandaram said the agitation was not confined to Punjab and Haryana but it was a question of farmers across the country. He found fault with the government for bringing in such harsh laws that did not enjoy the confidence of farmers and neither the farmers’ organisations nor the opposition parties were consulted before introducing the acts. Mr. Kodandaram alleged that the support system for purchase of crops was compromised with the new laws and the farmers’ fears of corporates taking over the farming sector was a harsh truth. The government’s intention were clear in extending new space for the corporates compromising the interests of farmers, he felt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/follow-punjab-example-kodandaram-tells-farmers/article33236241.ece

Kavitha including disqualification since she had admitted to have voted in two places with the same Voters Identity Card for Parliament, recent MLC and now the GHMC polls. In a communication to the ECI, general secretary G. Premander Reddy alleged that Ms. Kavitha, daughter of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and a former MP from Nizamabad, had tweeted with a photo claiming to have voted for the GHMC elections and urging other citizens also to do so. The address given for the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polls vote eligibility is to an apartment in Road No.14, Banjara Hills.Ms. Kavitha was recently elected MLC to the Legislative Council from Nizamabad Local Bodies constituency and at the time of filing of her nomination, she had declared her residential address as the one in Banjara Hills and also stated that her name had been enrolled in the Bodhan Assembly constituency. Even in the special summary revision of the voters lists her name figured in Bodhan and when she had contested from the Nizamabad for the Lok Sabha polls also she was enrolled as a voter there. “We have found on verfication that Mrs. Kavitha is having a vote in Hyderabad too with the same Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC) in Khairatabad Assembly constituency. Hence, she is guilty of resorting to cast vote in two places,” he charged. Mr. Reddy claimed since it was “evident that she indulged in corrupt electoral malpractices by voting in two places”, therefore she should be disqualified from being MLC in Telangana, the communication added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/disqualify-kavitha-for-voting-at-two-places-sec-urged/article33236237.ece

03 December 2020||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||Transport Minister alleges attempt on him||Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar has alleged that a group of BJP activists tried to kill him by attacking his car in Hyderabad on Tuesday as part of the saffron party's politics of "hatred and lies" for "selfish political interests." “A group of BJP cadre stopped my car and made a vain bid to attack me while I was heading to the Mamata Academy of Medical Sciences at Bachupally to oversee the ongoing construction work at our institute,” he said while referring to the incident that took place near KPHB colony in the State capital on the GHMC polling day on Tuesday. Talking to media persons after visiting the IT Hub, which is slated to be inaugurated tentatively on December 7, here on Wednesday Mr Ajay said, "I had escaped the attack thanks to the alertness of my personal security personnel and the local police, who swiftly dispersed the frenzied group of BJP activists. Several TRS cadre soon reached the spot but maintained restraint, he said. “I had confined myself to the Minister's quarters since the end of GHMC election campaign and my stay in the State capital was imperative to fulfill my obligations as a minister,” he noted. Rebutting the charges made by some BJP city leaders alleging that he was moving in the KPHB area to influence voters on the election day, Mr Ajay said, "I challenge them (BJP leaders) to prove their charges. The allegations were baseless and politically motivated, he said, accusing the BJP leaders of unleashing false propaganda for electoral gains. “We (TRS cadre) will not be cowed down by the intimidating tactics and continue to serve public interest relentlessly,” he added. He condemned CPI national secretary K Narayana's reported demand for his expulsion from the State Cabinet over Tuesday's incident of attack on his car in Hyderabad. Taking a swipe at Mr Narayanayan, Mr Ajay said: "His remarks are absurd and baseless and how can he make such comments without verifying the facts." "I am a minister in Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's cabinet and not a bantrothu (attender) at the Makhdoom Bhavan (CPI State headquarters)," he retorted.

03 December 2020||New Delhi,||Farmers invoke Tikait, evoke 1988 Boat Club protest||A little over 32 years after lakhs of farmers descended on the Boat Club lawns in New Delhi for Mahendra Singh Tikait’s legendary campaign — successfully securing waiver of power and water bills, and higher price for sugarcane, countless farmers on Wednesday gathered at one of the five gates of Delhi seeking inspiration from the famous 1988 stir. Considered the most prominent leader of his kind in the country, Mr. Tikait had led five lakh farmers from western Uttar Pradesh in a week-long successful siege. Closing in on day seven of their own battle, members of Mr. Tikait’s Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) — camped a kilometre away from the Ghaziabad-Delhi border, which they have named ‘Kisan Kranti Gate’ — said what was unfolding now was “another Boat Club” protest, but this time they were prepared for a much longer agitation.  More reinforcements Meanwhile, farmers predominantly affiliated with BKU (Bhanu) gathered at the Noida-Delhi border and called for reinforcements and supplies as arrangements were put in place to brave yet another cold evening, wedged between the U.P and Delhi police forces. Their parked vehicles stretched for over half-a-kilometre along a slip road leading to the Delhi border. Farmers were seen sitting around traditional hukkas discussing current events and future course of action. Others napped below tractors laden with supplies ostensibly meant to last several days if not weeks. “This protest is taking place 32 years after the Boat Club stir. Back then, political leaders, no matter how influential they were, and Prime Ministers, no matter how popular they were, came to talk to the farmers because we are a democracy and this country runs on dialogue. What is stopping the current PM from reaching out to us on his own?” asked Ravindra Khari from Meerut. We are willing to forgo “any benefit” the Centre sees as “unnecessary” for farmers, Rambir Chauhan from Surajpur said, but added that they would fight till the end for what they deemed necessary for their survival. “The three agriculture laws will hurt farmers severely in the long run. We have already conveyed our demands to the government and now it is time for them to decide. We came here for a solution and we will stay here till we get it. If not, we are the sons of the same warrior-farmers who brought Delhi to a standstill once before. This is the Boat Club rally of our generation,” he said. ‘Come and talk to us’ “Is this the Naya Bharat that we were promised? One where farmers are being forced to sit on the streets for their rightful due? We are only claiming our right, not anybody else’s. Why hide behind papers, Ministers and announcements? Come and talk to us. We are the same people who voted you to power just a year ago,” said Vijender Singh from Bijnore. As more tractors brought provisions and protesters to the meeting point a stone’s throw away from the Gautam Buddha statue at the Noida Gate, announcements were made by union leaders urging farmers to heed the leadership’s call to maintain calm and cleanliness. After already having spent the previous night in the open, efforts were on to make the next night as comfortable as possible. “There is another meeting (with the government) on Thursday but we are not very hopeful about the outcome. We have enough provisions for tonight and more are on the way,” said Yudhvir Chaudhary from Kasna.  We came here for a solution and we will stay here till we get it. If not, we are the sons of the same warrior-farmers who brought Delhi to a standstill once before.

03 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Kejriwal attacks Punjab CM over farm laws||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday hit out at his Punjab counterpart Captain Amrinder Singh for alleging that the Delhi government has passed the three farmer ordinances in Delhi, despite knowing that these three laws are passed by the Centre and it is not the prerogative of any State to implement or not implement such laws. Mr. Kejriwal asked Captain Singh not to indulge in “dirty politics” on farmers’ protests and added that that the allegations made by Captain Singh may be coming from his friendship with the BJP or he may be under pressure from the Centre to do so. Mr. Kejriwal added that he was also under tremendous pressure from the Centre to grant permission for the use of nine stadiums in Delhi to act as “jails” for the farmers, but he did not succumb to the pressure. He also said that Captain Singh had many chances to stop these farm bills as he was a member of committee to formulate and examine these bills, but did not stop these by raising objections in the committee itself. “Why did you not intimate people about how the Centre is trying to bring in these black laws? The farmers of Punjab want to know why you did not stop these farm bills,” Mr. Kejriwal asked. In his press statement, Mr. Kejriwal requested everybody to support the farmers. “When some call the farmers ‘terrorists’, ‘anti-nationals’ for protesting, I cannot imagine what the soldiers on the border must be going through, whose parents are being called terrorists. We all have to decide whether we are with the farmers or with people who are calling them ‘terrorists’,” Mr. Kejriwal said. He appealed to the Centre to accept all the demands of the farmers and provide a legal guarantee of MSP. The Delhi Congress, meanwhile, hit out at the Delhi government, saying that instead of extending its support to the farmers’ cause, it was playing a devious double-role, as on one hand it was shedding crocodile tears for the farmers and on the other, it has quietly notified one of the three farm laws it opposed on November 23 — the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance 2020.  Why did you [Punjab CM] not intimate people about how the Centre is trying to bring in these black laws?

According to a notification issued by the Health and Family Welfare Department, anyone undergoing the RT-PCR test at private laboratories within the State will now have to pay a maximum of Rs. 400 including the GST. The decision followed a reduction in the cost of testing kits and other accessories, a senior official said. The official hoped that reduction in the price of the test will lead to an increase in testing. The price of RT-PCR test at private laboratories and hospitals which was initially pegged at Rs. 4,500, was capped at Rs. 2,200 in July and Rs. 1,200 in August. The tests will be conducted by private laboratories under supervision of Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/odisha-caps-rt-pcr-test-price-at-rs-400/article33235930.ece
03 December 2020||CHANDIGARH,||Withdraw support to govt. in Haryana, Cong. tells JJP||Congress leaders in Haryana on Wednesday called upon the Jannayak Janta Party legislators, Independents and the BJP MLAs in favour of the farming community to “to listen to their conscience” on the Centre’s agriculture laws and part ways with the ruling BJP-JJP government in the State. Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja said the JJP, which won 10 seats by seeking votes against the BJP before the Assembly election, had betrayed the people of the State by extending support to the BJP last year. ‘Stand with people’ “Now, JJP has an opportunity to withdraw its support to the government and stand in favour of the people of Haryana,” she said. She also appealed to Independents as well as BJP MLAs, who are in favour of farming community, to join the farmers in their fight against the Central laws. Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda also called on the JJP and Independent MLAs supporting the government to withdraw support. “Such leaders have shown greater love for power than farmers’ interests,” he said. ‘People feel betrayed’ “The annadata farmer of the State has been forced to take to the roads and the JJP and Independent MLAs, who took their votes, are enjoying power. They sought votes against the BJP government but are now supporting them. There is anger among the people as they feel betrayed as these MLAs are not speaking a word against the government which is using batons, tear gas and water cannons on the farmers who are agitating in a democratic and peaceful manner,” Mr. Hooda added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/withdraw-support-to-govt-in-haryana-cong-tells-jjp/article33235932.ece

Chief Secretary Niranjan Arya said here on Wednesday that the payment of full wages to labourers would be ensured by dividing the work in the groups and measuring the completion of task by each worker. “No village panchayat will be left with absence of demand for work by the labourers,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/rural-jobs-for-15-lakh-families-in-rajasthan/article33235928.ece
03 December 2020||Mumbai,||Dawood’s Ratnagiri properties fetch Rs. 1.10 crore in auction||Three properties of fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim in Ratnagiri district were sold in an auction for over Rs. 1 crore, an official said on Wednesday. The auction was held earlier this week under the Smugglers And Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act (SAFEMA), the official said. Ravindra Kate was the successful bidder for a plot measuring 30 gunthas, another measuring 50 gunthas and a building, all located in Lote village in the Khed tehsil (one guntha is approximately 1,089 square feet). The reserve price for these properties was Rs. 1,09,15,500, while the winning bid was for Rs. 1,10,01,051. “The properties are close to the highway,” additional commissioner of SAFEMA R.N. D’Souza said. These assets were up for auction in November along with six other properties of the gangster, but due to some technical issue they had remained unsold. A few more properties in Khed tehsil will be auctioned off soon. The process was conducted through e-auction, public auction and sealed tender auction, Mr. D’Souza said. Mr. Kate, a resident of Khed, won these properties in a sealed tender auction. ‘High reserve price’ There were no takers for the properties of Dawood’s close aide, Iqbal Mirchi, due to the high reserve price. “We have sent those property rates for revaluation, as the market is down due to the COVID-19 situation. A fresh auction will be conducted,” Mr. D’Souza said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/dawoods-ratnagiri-properties-fetch-rs-110-crore-in-auction/article33235809.ece
03 December 2020||Mumbai,||Not easy to shift Film City from Mumbai, says Sena||Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanth’s visit to Mumbai to woo Bollywood personalities to shift the film industry to his State has not gone down well with the Shiv Sena. The ruling party on Wednesday questioned if the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was specifically targeting Mumbai and the State. “Many States in the country have film industries. Be it Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal or Karnataka. We have not seen Yogi Adityanath or any other BJP leader approaching film producers and studios in these States. Are they specifically targeting Mumbai and Maharashtra?” asked Sena MP Sanjay Raut. “Is it a joke? How can anyone take away Film City from Mumbai? It is not easy. Mumbai and the film industry go years back and enjoy a history of struggle. He should also tell what has happened to the earlier claims of constructing a film city in Noida.” Mr. Raut said. State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the reasons behind the film industry’s growth were Mumbai’s inclusivity, multiculturalism and efficient law and order. “Whoever intends to recreate Bollywood is most welcome to do so, but they should first ensure that they fulfil these criteria,” he said. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) said Bollywood has been thriving in Mumbai for the past 100 years. “There are film cities in different parts of the country. Every State has a right to set up its own film city. However, Bollywood remains with Mumbai and nobody can snatch it away,” said NCP leader and Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik. The BJP claimed that the Sena was upset over the warm reception Mr. Adityanath received. “Mumbai is the mother of the film industry. The State government could not provide monetary help when shooting was stalled due to COVID-19, but their goons collect ransom from film sets. The government must ponder over why the film industry is welcoming Yogi Adityanath,” said BJP MLA Ram Kadam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/not-easy-to-shift-film-city-from-mumbai-says-sena/article33235811.ece
03 December 2020||New Delhi,||Twitter flags Malviya’s tweet as ‘manipulated’||Microblogging website Twitter has flagged a tweet related to the ongoing protests by farmers against the recent agriculture laws put out by Amit Malviya, who heads the information and technology department for the BJP, as ‘manipulated media.’ According to Twitter’s policy, a tweet may be labelled as ‘manipulated,’ or removed in some cases, if the company has a reason to believe that the content, or the context in which the content is presented, is “significantly and deceptively altered or manipulated.” To assess such media, it looks at whether editing has been done in a manner that fundamentally alters the content composition, if it has been shared in a deceptive manner, and if it is likely to impact public safety or cause harm. The U.S.-headquartered firm either uses its own technology to determine if contents have been significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated, or receives reports through partnerships with third parties. On November 28, Mr. Malviya, in response to a tweet by former Congress president Rahul Gandhi showing a policeman swinging a baton at an elderly farmer during a lathi-charge at a recent protest, tweeted, “Rahul Gandhi must be the most discredited opposition leader India has seen in a long long time.” Along with the text, he shared a video with the heading “propaganda vs. reality” that showed that while the cop did swing the baton, the farmer escaped its blow.  Fact-checked Mr. Malviya’s tweet was fact-checked by AltNews as well as BoomLive. According to AltNews, the video shared by Mr. Malviya was made by a Twitter user who goes by the handle ‘Political Kida.’ The video shared by this handle was also marked as ‘manipulated media.’ Meanwhile, Boomlive got in touch with the farmer in the video who said he did suffer injuries to his forearm, back and calf muscle. This is perhaps the first case of Twitter implementing its labelling policy in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/twitter-flags-malviyas-tweet-as-manipulated/article33236205.ece
03 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC disagrees with U.P. plea to cut 2,940 trees||The Supreme Court on Wednesday did not completely agree to an Uttar Pradesh government request to fell 2,940 trees for the Krishna Goverdhan road project in Mathura, saying “you cannot fell thousands of trees in the name of Krishna”. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde said the only likely inconvenience in retaining these trees would be that the road may not travel straight to host high-speed traffic. “Such an effect may not necessary be deleterious particularly since high speed on the highways is known to cause serious accidents and cause of innumerable deaths on Indian roads,” the court pointed out. The Bench did not quite accept the Uttar Pradesh Public Works Department and U.P. Bridge Corporation’s assurances to “compensate” the loss of these trees with planting the same type of trees in another area. The court said the value of trees marked for felling cannot be compensated in mere “arithmetical terms”.  ‘No compensation’ The court said planting a sapling somewhere is no effective compensation for the loss of a 100-year-old tree. It said a sapling in the place of a century-old tree cannot be even seen as effective re-afforestation. The court said the State was not forthcoming about the classification of the trees marked for felling or their age. Chief Justice Bobde noted that the State was not in a position to “make a statement as to how the Forest Department of Uttar Pradesh intends to evaluate the trees in question”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/sc-disagrees-with-up-plea-to-cut-2940-trees/article33235929.ece

03 December 2020||Washington,||No evidence of decisive poll fraud: AG||In yet another setback for U.S. President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Barr has said that there is no widespread evidence of election fraud, contradicting Mr. Trump’s claims that his opponent Joe Biden stole the election on the basis of mail-in voting. The President and his allies have asked for recounts, mounted legal challenges, and engaged in political manoeuvring to prevent States from certifying their elections over the last few weeks but their efforts have been unsuccessful, with key battleground States like Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Michigan certifying their election results recently. While the U.S. Justice Department, which Mr. Barr leads, is following up specific election-related complaints, “to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,” Mr. Barr, a Trump ally, told the Associated Press in an interview. Last month, Mr. Barr had authorised federal prosecutors to investigate “substantial allegations” of election irregularities — something not usually done until after the election is certified, causing one official, who objected to the memo from Mr. Barr, to step down. Mr. Trump continued tweeting his allegations of election fraud on Tuesday after Mr. Barr’s views were made public. “With all due respect to the Attorney General, there hasn’t been any semblance of a Department of Justice investigation,” Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis said in a statement reacting to Mr Barr’s comments. Russian links probe Mr. Barr also revealed that in October he had appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham as Special Counsel to investigate those who had probed alleged Russian links to the Trump campaign. Special Counsels have protections in terms of their employment and independence — Mr. Durham will be able to continue his work in the Biden administration, although he will report to a Biden-appointed Attorney General. “In advance of the presidential election, I decided to appoint Mr. Durham as a special counsel to provide him and his team with the assurance that they could complete their work, without regard to the outcome of the election,” Mr. Barr wrote in a letter to the U.S. Congress. Mr. Durham had first been appointed in 2019 to review the origins of the Trump-Russia FBI investigation (called ‘ Crossfire Hurricane’) and probe the officials involved in it — a process that resulted in former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith being charged. Mr. Clinesmith pleaded guilty, in August this year, to tampering with an email from the CIA so he could wiretap a Trump campaign official. In his letter to Congress, Mr. Barr said he had expected Mr. Durham to complete his work by the summer of 2020 but the pandemic and “additional information he uncovered” had prevented this from happening. Mr Durham’s remit will also involve the period after May 2017 — when Special Counsel Robert Mueller took charge of the investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 elections. “Barr is using the special counsel law for a purpose it was not intended: to continue a politically motivated investigation long after Barr leaves office," House Intelligence Chairman (Democrat) Adam Schiff said. Some Republicans supported the appointment. “I hope my Democrat colleagues will show Special Counsel Durham the same respect they showed Special Counsel Mueller," Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/no-evidence-of-decisive-poll-fraud-ag/article33235571.ece
03 December 2020||San Francisco,||Trump threatens military spending veto||Donald Trump has threatened to veto a major military funding bill unless Congress abolishes a liability law protecting social media firms regularly accused of bias by the President. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gives immunity to tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter from legal action on content posted by users. Both platforms have found themselves the target of incandescent fury from Mr. Trump in recent weeks after they began attaching disclaimers to social media posts by the president that claimed he had lost last month’s election due to voter fraud. Mr. Trump has doubled on a months-old push to abolish the statute in response — a move that has been backed by his congressional allies. “Section 230... represents a serious threat to our national security and the integrity of the elections,” the President tweeted on Tuesday night. “Therefore, if the very dangerous & unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), I will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill,” he added, referring to the annual Bill that authorises the Pentagon’s budget. Some of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies have found themselves under fire from both sides of the political spectrum for their handling of content during a bitter U.S. presidential campaign this year. Republican officials have accused tech firms of censoring conservative voices and grilled Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey during congressional hearings earlier in November. Both platforms limited the reach of many of Mr. Trump’s posts, notably those in which the president rejected his election defeat or questioned the integrity of the voting process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-threatens-military-spending-veto/article33235569.ece
03 December 2020||Washington,||‘Biden sets new demands for return to Iran nuclear deal’||U.S. President-elect Joe Biden will insist Iran agrees to new demands if it wants the U.S. to return to a nuclear deal and lift sanctions, The New York Times said on Wednesday. The Times said the Biden administration would seek to extend the duration of “restrictions on Iran’s production of fissile material that could be used to make a (nuclear) bomb” in a new round of negotiations. Iran would also have to address its “malign” regional activities through proxies in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen in the talks that would have to include its Arab neighbours like Saudi Arabia, the report said. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the deal in 2018 and has reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign against the US’s arch enemy. Mr. Biden, who defeated Mr. Trump at the ballot box last month, said during campaigning that he intends to offer Iran a “credible path back to diplomacy”. In the interview published on Wednesday, the incoming U.S. President stood by those views, saying: “It’s going to be hard, but yeah.” “Look, there’s a lot of talk about precision missiles and all range of other things that are destabilising the region,” Mr. Biden was quoted as saying. But, he added, “the best way to achieve getting some stability in the region” was to deal “with the nuclear program”. Arms race Mr. Biden warned that if Iran acquired a bomb, it would spark a nuclear arms race in the West Asia, “and the last goddamn thing we need in that part of the world is a buildup of nuclear capability”. “In consultation with our allies and partners, we’re going to engage in negotiations and follow-on agreements to tighten and lengthen Iran’s nuclear constraints, as well as address the missile program,” he said .  Mr. Biden was cited as saying that the U.S. always had the option to international snap back sanctions if need be, and that Iran knew that. The 2015 nuclear deal — known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA — gave Iran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-sets-new-demands-for-return-to-iran-nuclear-deal/article33235562.ece
03 December 2020||COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka SC rejects petitions against COVID-19 cremation||The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka on Tuesday dismissed  petitions, including those filed by Muslim civil society members, challenging government regulations mandating cremation for all COVID-19-related deaths. The gazette notification issued in April, a month after Sri Lanka detected its first local case of the coronavirus, set off concern among the island’s Muslims — they make up about 10% of Sri Lanka’s 21 million population — who sought a policy revision as the practice of cremations goes against their religious beliefs. However, despite the World Health Organization’s guidelines saying victims could be “buried or cremated”, the government’s COVID-19 regulations say bodies of “all COVID-19 victims will be cremated within 24 hours of the death”. Last week, a government-appointed experts’ committee too maintained that cremation was the only option to be made available in Sri Lanka for COVID-19 victims. “We are very concerned, but we still hope that the President will do the right thing and direct authorities to let Muslim families bury COVID-19 victims in their families,” N.M. Ameen, president of Muslim Council of Sri Lanka, told The Hindu . Critics have slammed the government for its “discrimination” against the minority community. From UN Rapporteurs to international human rights organisations, many have urged the Sri Lankan government to review the decision and respect the Muslim community’s burial rights. The top court’s decision comes amid a deadly second wave of COVID-19 in the island nation, that has rapidly increased the total number of cases to about 24,500 and that of victims to 122. The pandemic has spread to all districts of Sri Lanka. Prison riots Meanwhile, following the prison riots near Colombo on Sunday, in which guards opened fire killing 11 inmates and injured over 100, authorities on Wednesday said eight of the 11 who died were found to be COVID-19 positive patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-sc-rejects-petitions-against-covid-19-cremation/article33235568.ece

Most of the information in the 18-page court order is redacted, including the identity of the people whom prosecutors are investigating and whom the proposed pardon might be intended for.

03 December 2020||Beijing,||China’s #MeToo case gets its moment in court||A sexual harassment case against a powerful Chinese media figure began in Beijing on Wednesday, with his accuser calling it a major moment in the country’s still-young #MeToo movement. Zhou Xiaoxuan, now 27, sparked a social media storm in 2018 after accusing prominent television host Zhu Jun of groping and forcibly kissing her when she was an intern at state broadcaster CCTV. China’s first-ever civil code — passed in May — expanded the definition of sexual harassment, but many women are still reluctant to come forward and it is rare for cases like this to make it to court. “I’m very nervous,” she told AFP on Wednesday ahead of the hearing. “But whether we win or lose the case, it has meaning.” “If we lose, it allows the questions we raised at least to remain in history. Someone will have to give us an answer.” Ms. Zhou said she found herself alone in a dressing room with Zhu in 2014, and that he groped her after asking if she wanted to continue to work for the channel after her internship. Ms. Zhu is a former host of the country’s annual Spring Festival Gala — one of the world’s most-watched television shows. Allegations denied He has denied the allegations, and launched his own court case accusing her of damaging his reputation. There were several hundred supporters outside the court on Wednesday, some holding banners reading “#MeToo” or “We oppose sexual harassment”. Lucy Lu, a supporter, said: “No matter what happens, we think she is very brave.” Ms. Zhou broke down in tears as she addressed her supporters ahead of the trial, telling them: “We may be joyous or we may run into setbacks. But please don’t take my setbacks to heart. “We have to believe that even if history repeats itself, things will definitely progress,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/chinas-metoo-case-gets-its-moment-in-court/article33235563.ece
03 December 2020||Tehran,||Rouhani rejects Bill on nuclear enrichment||Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday rejected a Bill approved by Parliament that would have suspended UN inspections and boosted uranium enrichment, saying it was “harmful” to diplomatic efforts aimed at restoring the 2015 nuclear deal and easing U.S. sanctions. The tug-of-war over the Bill, which gained momentum after the killing of a prominent Iranian nuclear scientist last month, reflects the rivalry between Mr. Rouhani, a relative moderate, and hard-line lawmakers who dominate Parliament and favour a more confrontational approach to the West. The Bill would have suspended UN inspections and required the government to resume enriching uranium to 20% if European nations fail to provide relief from crippling U.S. sanctions. That level falls short of the threshold needed for nuclear weapons but is higher than that required for civilian purposes. Speaking at a Cabinet meeting, Mr. Rouhani said his administration, “considers it harmful for the trend of diplomatic activities.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/rouhani-rejects-bill-on-nuclear-enrichment/article33235566.ece

03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Hard bargains and the art of policymaking||The ongoing farmers’ agitation epitomises the need to have detailed discussions and consultations while making law and policy. The process of building consensus and addressing concerns may be time-consuming, but it leads to greater acceptance of policy objectives. While such work has to be done at multiple levels, Parliament is perhaps the most important forum for this. It has a well-established process to get inputs of experts and stakeholders, and to build cross-party consensus while enacting a law. This is usually done through its committees. The government can also use other consultative mechanisms, such as expert committees and consultative groups, to get feedback and tailor policy. Parliamentary committees perform a very important role in the lawmaking process. They allow MPs to engage with experts and understand the nuances of a Bill, enable discussion across party lines without the pressure of posturing for the public, and on several occasions, these committees have helped negotiate a path through conflicting interests. The GST journey An example will illustrate the working of this process. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) was proposed to be introduced about a decade ago. As GST subsumed several taxes in the Union List (such as excise duties) and the State List (such as sales tax), the Constitution had to be amended. This amendment required not just the support of two-thirds of members of each House of Parliament, but also ratification by half the State legislatures. For successful implementation, the new system needed support across party lines and State governments, as value chains for goods and services run across States. Lack of proper implementation by even one State in the value chain would jeopardise the working of the system, as it requires matching of invoices and crediting taxes across the chain. An empowered group of State Finance Ministers was set up in 2007, and it was a key forum for discussing and negotiating the new tax. Importantly, this body was chaired by a State Finance Minister from a party in the Opposition at the Centre. Based on its inputs, a Bill was introduced in 2011 to amend the Constitution. This Bill suggested a GST Council (which would decide through consensus) as the apex body to take all decisions regarding the tax, and a GST Dispute Settlement Authority. The Standing Committee on Finance examined the Bill, received numerous suggestions from experts and States, and made several recommendations. Notably, these included proposing a voting procedure for the GST Council, dropping the dispute resolution authority, and including a compensation structure for States that may lose revenue due to their taxes being subsumed by the GST. A new Bill was introduced in 2015 which incorporated these changes. This Bill also introduced a tax of 1% on inter-State sale, and a compensation for a period of up to five years. The Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha, but the Rajya Sabha referred it to a Select Committee. This Committee suggested that the tax on inter-State trade be dropped as it would negate the objective of making India a single market. It also recommended that compensation to States be guaranteed for a period of five years. The Constitution (Amendment) Bill was passed with these changes, and ratified by States. Subsequently, the GST Council, which had Finance Ministers from all States, unanimously approved the draft of the Bills to implement the GST. That set of Bills was also passed by Parliament and all State legislatures. Throughout this process, the empowered committee of State Finance Ministers was also having regular meetings and addressing the concerns of States. Deliberative fora This process highlights the importance of building a broad consensus before making a major policy or legislative change. The Standing Committee and Select Committee provided fora for parliamentarians to engage with experts and stakeholders, which helped them recommend changes that would lead to a broadly acceptable Bill. Though the process was time-consuming, it led to a new tax structure, which had broad support across all States — a necessary condition for it to work. There were compromises made, such as multiplicity of rates and a very generous compensation for States, but these helped get the new tax off the ground. Compare this with the process followed for the new farm laws. The Bills were initially enacted through ordinances. That is, the government enacted these laws through executive decision when Parliament was not in session. Stakeholders ignored However, ordinances need to be ratified by Parliament when it meets next. The Bills to replace the ordinance were introduced in Lok Sabha and passed within three days without being referred to a Standing Committee. In Rajya Sabha, several members moved motions to refer them to a Select Committee. These motions led to commotion, amidst allegations that a demand for division (recorded vote) was ignored, and the Bills were passed amidst pandemonium. Thus, an opportunity to discuss and debate the Bills with stakeholders was missed.  While the jurisdiction of Parliament to enact these laws seems to be clear, they affect agricultural markets, which are governed by State laws. Much of the implementation would depend on State governments. States may also get lower taxes from these markets. It was important to address the concerns of various stakeholders, including farmers and State governments. The absence of proactive engagement with affected parties has led to the current crisis. Three States — all with Opposition governments — have passed their own laws to negate some of the provisions of the central laws. And a large number of farmers are protesting against the laws. We need to learn an important lesson from this episode. Stable policy-making needs a broad agreement on the benefits of the policy. Such consensus has to be built through conversations with stakeholders. Parliament should revitalise its committees to enable wider public participation. It should insist that every Bill is deliberated upon in a committee, much like what the British Parliament does. Parliament needs to perform its function as a deliberative body that enables compromises to assuage concerns.

06 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Questionable data, little room for exuberance||The decline in the quarterly GDP growth rate, by 7.5% during July-September 2020 (FY 2020-21: Q2), compared to a 24% decline in the first quarter has raised expectations of a sharp economic recovery after the novel coronavirus pandemic and the national lockdown. But is such optimism justified? A tracker India’s GDP at current prices in 2019-20 was Rs. 204-lakh crore, or $2.8 trillion at an exchange rate of Rs. 73 to a dollar). Its growth rate over the previous year (2018-19) was 5% in real terms, that is net of inflation. The economy, expectedly, slumped after the pandemic and the economic lockdown in March this year. Output contracted by as much as 24% during April-June 2020 (FY 2021: Q1) compared to the same period last year. In June, economic activity resumed as the lockdown began to be gradually lifted. Expectedly, output recovered sharply, reducing the extent of contraction. During the July-September quarter (FY2021: Q2), output growth contracted by 7.5%, compared to the same period in the previous year, an official press released last Friday showed. The economic rebound is being hailed as a vindication of the government’s decision (though harsh) to impose the national lockdown at four hours’ notice as well as the success of the relief and revival packages that were announced by the Centre later. By extrapolating from the latest quarterly estimates, many believe that the adverse effects of the lockdown would be behind us by the end of the current financial year in March 2021 . But such optimism is in contrast to widespread academic and informed opinion that is of the view that India had introduced one of the strictest lockdowns in the world which has resulted in the sharpest output contractions and massive losses in terms of jobs and livelihoods. So how credible is the popular optimism? On expected lines To begin with, not much should be read into the quarterly national income estimates as they are mostly extrapolations or projections of the annual estimates, using rates and ratios. Very little up-to-date primary information from farms, factories and offices is available for the estimation. However, the quarterly figures do indicate the broad direction of change. In this case the change is on the expected lines. That said, some estimates seem anomalous. Manufacturing sector output growth witnessed the sharpest rebound: from a negative 39% in the first quarter to positive 0.6% growth in the second quarter looks too good to be true. Corresponding figures for the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), based on physical output indicators, are minus 40.7% and minus 6.8% respectively. The groundswell for the suspicions are prima facie valid given the long-standing dispute over the estimation of manufacturing sector GDP on account of questionable corporate sector quarterly financial returns. Nevertheless, one should cautiously analyse the quarterly variations between GDP and IIP numbers as there are too many factors that could account for the observed discrepancies. There are, however, more serious and substantive issues to grapple with, considering the opportunistic biases that dominate the public discourse. The lockdown shaved off nearly one-fourth of the yearly output in the first quarter. The output during the first half of the year (April-September 2020) (FY2011: H1) is just about 40% of the GDP in 2019-20 at constant prices. The economy has to grow at an unprecedented rate in the remaining two quarters to climb back to the output level of 2019-20. Do prospects look bright for such growth rates? The answer is doubtful for the following reasons. Demand is still weak The healthy recovery in the second quarter met the pent-up demand for industrial goods and to re-build inventories. Aggregate demand is still very weak. Despite much vocal support, the government’s current and capital expenditures have hardly moved up in the first half of the year when compared to the previous year. The government’s debt-GDP ratio has gone up though, mainly to make up for revenue shortfalls. Bank credit growth in the economy continues to decelerate — 5.1 % in Q2, when compared to 8.8% in the same quarter last year. After the sharp recovery of output in the second quarter, many high frequency output indicators — that is, those economic variables for which up-to-date information is available at shorter time intervals — suggest the momentum of recovery to be tapering off. For example, the official infrastructure index of eight core sector industries (namely, coal, natural gas, crude oil, refinery products such as petrol and diesel, fertilizers, steel, cement and electricity) declined by 2.5% in October over the same period last year. The cumulative growth of the index from April to October this year stood at negative 13% when compared to the same period last year. Balance of payment surplus The opportunist bias in public perception is also based on related aggregate economic indicators beyond production trends. The Chief Economic Adviser has exuded confidence that the financial year is likely to end with a balance of payment surplus, as a badge of good economic management. This is surprising since elementary economics would make it clear that balance of payment surplus for a developing country means that it is importing less than the warranted rate of import growth for maintaining sustainable output expansion. Most of the shortfall is on account of a sharp decline in investment demand, denting potential output. Similarly, populist optimism is based on rising foreign exchange reserves and a booming stock market. They are taken as evidence of global confidence in Indian economic policy. These are fallacious measures. India’s burgeoning foreign exchange reserves are made up of short-term debt flows; they are not our net export earnings (unlike China’s). Similarly, the booming stock market is almost entirely driven by short-term foreign capital inflows, propping up the balance of payment. They are a sign of the economy’s weakness — not strength — as such inflows are highly fickle, representing hot money, which can quit the financial markets in a jiffy if perceptions change for any exogenous reason. The prognosis In conclusion, a sharp recovery in the second quarter GDP — thus reducing the decline in the quarterly growth rate — represents meeting the pent-up demand after the ‘Unlock’ phase started in June. One should not attach too much value to the precise number of quarterly growth rates as the underlying estimation methods and the data used are weak and questionable. Whether the tempo of recovery will be maintained and whether India will wipe out the negative growth for the current year are open to doubt. Many high frequency data series suggest moderation of the recovery after the initial bounce from the ‘Unlock’ phase. Since additional expenditure on government consumption or investment or credit growth remain muted, the recovery is likely to remain modest for the year as a whole. There is little room for exuberance given the limited boost to aggregate demand to sustain the recovery momentum. R. Nagaraj was with the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai.

03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Behind China’s wolf warrior diplomacy||In the last few years, ‘nationalism’ has returned as a governing theme of global politics and relations among major world actors. However, of late, a peculiarly abrasive brand of nationalism has come to be associated with China, and more importantly with the persona of Chinese President Xi Jinping. While Beijing’s recourse to nationalistic aggression as a foreign policy stratagem has gained the euphemism of ‘wolf warrior diplomacy’ only recently, it has been a work-in-progress for much longer and involves a state-sponsored and systemic indoctrination campaign. Under Mr. Xi, this process has become even more intense and has acquired the dynamics of ‘Chinese nationalism with Xi Jinping at [the] Core’. Its basis The Chinese Communist Party initially embraced nationalism as a co-option strategy in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Consequently, nationalism was turned into a state dogma to embed the Chinese Communist Party in the political subconsciousness of the country, and secure the filial piety of its populace. While this process marked the Chinese Communist Party’s transition from a revolutionary to a national party, it forever transformed the Chinese nation-state into a Party-state. It is this ‘Party-state’ brand of nationalism that the international community is being confronted with. Today, this nationalism derives its inspiration from the idiom of ‘Great Rejuvenation’ and its obsession with re-achieving the glories of an imaginary past. Mr. Xi has turned this old Chinese Communist Party jargon into a hallmark of the Party’s success and a tool to advance his personal ambitions. Therefore, Chinese nationalism presents a hedonistic combination of the Chinese Communist Party’s raison d’être to remain as China’s political master, Mr. Xi’s relentless quest to cast the Party into his own image, and a popular sentiment fed on the rubric of the ‘China Dream’. Hence, this version of nationalism is as much domestically oriented as it is directed at an international audience. Linked to a threat perception The first concerted attempt by the Chinese Communist Party to shape Chinese nationalism came with the launch of the ‘Patriotic Education Campaign’ in the 1990s. Consequently, a narrative of ‘Century of humiliation’ was invented and etched in public memory as a historical fact. At the core of this campaign was the grand design to project the Chinese Communist Party as the harbinger and sole guarantor of the peace, prosperity and sovereignty of the eternally ‘victimised’ Chinese nation. As such, the very legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party within Chinese politics is based upon an imaginary enemy or a threat perception. As Mr. Xi tries to rewrite the rules of the Party, and indeed the contours of the existing world order, he needs his own enemies. Therefore, nationalist mobilisation based on an aggressive posturing and display of strength in international affairs is an important currency in this larger scheme of things. At the domestic level, this nationalist fervour has been secured through patriotic indoctrination campaigns, promotion of a leadership personality cult, and the now legendary anti-corruption drive. Contrary to most international analysis, the drive has become a key component of nationalist sentiment in China. This is so because corruption has for long been recognised by the Chinese Communist Party as the single biggest challenge to its existence and thereby the survival of the Chinese nation in the political dynamics of a Party-state. In fact, the campaign has earned Mr. Xi the epithet of ‘fandui fubai’, or the one who is opposed to corruption among the Chinese public. Agenda of indoctrination On the issue of propaganda operations, their centrality in Mr. Xi’s politics can be gauged from the fact that after Mao, he has become the only Chinese leader to appoint a Party theoretician (Wang Huning) on the Politburo Standing Committee. The Chinese Communist Party’s patriotic indoctrination efforts consist of dedicated programmes for both the Party members, and the general public. The new ‘Patriotic Education’ guidelines were introduced in 2019, along with the ‘2019-2023 National Work Program for the Education and Cultivation of Party Members’. Though largely similar in content with their previous avatars, they present a much hard-line version of Communist ideology and aim for a wider dissemination of ideological indoctrination throughout Chinese society. In addition to dictating the academic curriculum, these guidelines promote extra-curricular activities such as ‘Red Education’ history tours which include visits to Chinese Communist Party museums and ‘martyrdom commemoration sites’, ‘Study Lei Feng Volunteer Service’ programmes, etc. The stated aim of such programmes is to achieve Mr. Xi’s mission to cultivate future generations of Chinese youth with ‘Red DNA’. Personality cult at its core The Chinese Communist Party’s propaganda machinery also designs customised programmes that target specific sections of society as per the Party’s perceived challenges. For instance, in 2018, the Party launched a “patriotic striving spirit” campaign to ‘enhance patriotism’ among Chinese intellectuals. This came in the wake of the famous letter by (recently sacked) Tsinghua Professor Xu Zhangrun in which he had criticised Mr. Xi. Similarly, Chinese media outlets have been asked to follow the dictum of “telling China’s stories well” to shape domestic and international opinion as per the Party’s diktats. While such top-down measures might elicit non-compliance or criticism from a public increasingly exposed to western ideas, the Party-state secures absolute acquiescence through the promotion of a personality cult around the core leadership, whereby all his actions become a rallying call for the masses. The promotion of the Xi Jinping personality cult has become an intrinsic component of Chinese nationalism, as with Mr. Xi’s ‘Two Centennial Goals’, the meticulously cultivated nostalgia of the Chinese people for the fabled Middle Kingdom appears more tangible than ever. Though Mr. Xi’s personality cult has percolated into practically all aspects of Chinese society, academic establishments have emerged as its primary targets. This follows his clarion call, back in 2016, to turn China’s universities into “strongholds of Party Leadership”. Today, several elite institutions in China have either established research centres or introduced mandatory courses in ‘Xi Jinping Thought’. Interestingly, even the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently inaugurated a ‘Xi Jinping Thought’ study centre to guide the “theoretical construction” of China’s foreign policy. The plans ahead The Xi Jinping cult of personality is set to gain further momentum after the recently concluded fifth plenum of the Party which approved a plan for China to become a global leader in technology by 2035. With this 15-year plan, Mr. Xi has further declared his intentions to remain at the helm of China’s affairs long after his due retirement date as General Secretary of the Party in 2022. While the decks of China’s politics will only become clear with the 20th Party Congress, the international community is poised to face an increasingly aggressive Chinese nationalism as Mr. Xi continues with his march to further entrench the Chinese Communist Party’s within Chinese society, and establish a personal legacy that surpasses all those of his predecessors.

03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||The purpose of a vaccine||While the whole world waits for a COVID-19 vaccine as the last resort to control the pandemic, it is important to examine the challenges it poses to qualify as a ‘public health’ intervention in India. Vaccinations have a dual purpose. First is the ability to develop immunity by producing antibodies among those individuals who have taken a vaccine shot. In the midst of a pandemic, the popular perception for vaccination is that which safeguards oneself from the disease. It is this individualistic need that generates a huge demand for vaccines in the market, which, in the absence of government intervention, will be affordable only for those who can pay for them. The second and more crucial purpose of vaccination is to achieve herd immunity in a population by ensuring a threshold coverage — the proportion of population that needs to be covered so that the entire population is protected. The threshold coverage for any disease in a given population is based on the vaccine efficacy in a population, the rate of spread of infection through it, also known as infectivity rate, and the natural immunity that already exists in the population due to prior exposure to the same disease or through cross infections. The threshold coverage is estimated to be around 60% for COVID-19 vaccine to achieve population-level immunity, which should ideally vary, depending on different stages of the pandemic. While deciding on whether vaccines need to be introduced amid a pandemic, there can be individual as well as population-level considerations. The concerns raised in the context of individual prevention include vaccine efficacy, which is generally defined as the probability that an individual, if vaccinated, can prevent the onset of infection. Equally important is the probability of adverse reactions that can arise among individuals. Both these parameters must be considered even to qualify vaccines as potential candidates for a public health intervention. However, there are several other complex economic, social, ethical and systemic factors that need to be looked into. Already, there are concerns raised about the economic resources needed to make the vaccine available for a large population: will it be provided free at the point of delivery or will it be charged? How will an already weakened health system be able to take on the vaccination drive that is expected to cover the entire population? What is the cost of ensuring necessary support services, including cold chains and human resources required for effective vaccine delivery? The most difficult ethical question posed is about who should be prioritised and what the basis is for such prioritisation. Equally relevant is the projected proportion of the population that may face adverse reactions and the ability of the health system to respond to those. Another aspect specific to the COVID-19 vaccine is the duration of protection provided. Unclear objectives These are all important questions, but they will arise only when the most important public health purpose of vaccination — as an immunisation programme — is convincingly answered. In the Indian context, it is not clear what outcome is expected of a population-based vaccination programme for COVID-19. The most dominant argument is that health workers need to be covered on a priority basis, and then the elderly. One of the arguments posed for targeting health workers is that it will protect the health system from collapsing due to COVID-19. If this is so, how can we think of the health system as comprising only health workers, when a majority of stakeholders, even in terms of mere numbers, are always the patients and their caregivers. Second — and more crucial — is the goal of population-level immunity, which is the expected outcome of any population-level vaccination drive. Its very purpose will be defeated if only a specific population group is targeted, when the pandemic can infect all groups similarly. In New Zealand, preparations are on for a countrywide immunisation programme with a goal of covering the whole population with a threshold coverage. Like other public health programmes, it is safe to demonstrate the success of vaccination as a public health intervention in a small population, like a block or a district, before scaling it up for the national level. If population-level immunity is not the focus, then the key purpose of COVID-19 vaccines will be to ensure individual immunity, which might operate within the logic of the market. We should not forget that it took us more than 13 years to declare eradication and achieve population-level immunity for a disease like polio, which targeted only children.

03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||A looming health crisis||While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on our daily lives, a silent pandemic has been brewing in the background for decades. Governments need to factor in new research and bring in businesses and consumers as active stakeholders before it is too late. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is growing at an alarming rate. Globally, about 35% of common human infections have become resistant to available medicines. About 700,000 people die every year because available antimicrobial drugs — antibiotics, antivirals, antiparasitic and antifungals — have become less effective at combating pathogens. Resistance to second- and third-line antibiotics — the last lines of defence against some common diseases — are projected to almost double between 2005 and 2030. In India, the largest consumer of antibiotics in the world, this is a serious problem. According to a study published inThe Lancet,an estimated 58,000 new-born childrendie annually from sepsis in India alone because antibiotics can no longer treat certain bacterial infections. We have long known that microorganisms develop resistance to antimicrobial agents as a natural defence mechanism. We have also known for some time that human activity has significantly accelerated the process. The misuse and overuse of antimicrobials for humans, livestock and agriculture is probably the biggest reason for this, but other factors also contribute. Research points to the role of environment and pollution in AMR. Once consumed, up to 80% of antibiotic drugs are excreted un-metabolised, along with resistant bacteria. Their release in effluents from households and health and pharmaceutical facilities, and agricultural run-off, is propagating resistant microorganisms. Wastewater treatment facilities are unable to remove all antibiotics and resistant bacteria. In India, there is capacity to treat only about 37% of the sewage generated annually. The rest is discharged into natural water bodies without treatment. An analysis of single wastewater discharge from a treatment facility in India catering to drug manufacturers found concentrations of antibiotics high enough to treat over 40,000 people daily. Water, then, may be a major mode for the spread of AMR, especially in places with inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene. Wildlife that comes into contact with discharge containing antimicrobials can also become colonised with drug-resistant organisms. Key initiatives This issue has been on the radar of scientists for several years. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) identified antimicrobial resistance as one of six emerging issues of environmental concern in its2017 Frontiers Report.In that same year, theUN Environment Assemblypressed the need to further understand the role of environmental pollution in spreading AMR. UN agencies are working together to develop the One Health AMR Global Action Plan (GAP) that addresses the issue in human, animal, and plant health and food and environment sectors. The Centre and State governments in India can strengthen the environmental dimensions of their plans to tackle antimicrobial resistance. It is particularly important to promote measures that address known hotspots such as hospitals and manufacturing and waste treatment facilities. This has started to an extent. Early in 2020, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) issueddraft standardswhich set limits for residues of 121 antibiotics in treated effluents from drug production units. These standards await finalisation. And in July this year, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and MoEF&CC constituted the inter-ministerial Steering Committee on Environment and Health, with representation from WHO and UNEP. We saw how quickly a pandemic can spread if we are not ready. This is an opportunity to get ahead of the next one.

03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Choppy tidings||Revenues from the GST crossed the Rs. 1-lakh crore mark for the second month in a row in November. The healthiest indirect tax collection streak since the national lockdown to combat COVID-19 in March, it is an encouraging sign for the economy that contracted less-than-expected in the second quarter. GST revenues in a month are a reflection of transactions from the previous month. The uptick in October’s GST collections can be partly explained by the speedier unlocking of the economy in September as public transport restrictions were lifted in most parts of India. Some compliance-related relaxations for GST-paying businesses also pushed up collections significantly. There is no such compliance caveat attached to November’s GST kitty — even though it is about Rs. 200 crore lower than the Rs. 1,05,155 crore from October. This suggests that the first month of the third quarter did see a genuine improvement in activity, whether it was driven by pent-up or festive demand, or a bit of both. This also ties in with other indicators from October, be it auto sales or the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which hit a 12-year high that month. With Deepavali falling in November this year (it was in October last year), some festive spending effect may be expected to come through in December’s GST collections as well. The question is whether the improved demand trend will hold after the festival exuberance fades. There are some early signs that the fervour and pace of economic activity already began to moderate in November. For instance, e-way bills generated by GST-covered entities fell nearly 14% to 55.3 million in November from 64.1 million in October, while the latest PMI indicates slower growth in orders and a further decline in employment as businesses are wary of the pandemic’s lingering uncertainties. While India’s infections have declined since September, some parts, including Delhi, Rajasthan and Gujarat, are seeing sharper spikes, prompting fresh travel curbs from there to the commercial capital Mumbai. In November, only Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu saw double-digit growth in GST collections among major States, while Delhi’s inflows fell 15% and Maharashtra’s by 6% year-on-year. Thus, economic activity that has resumed remains fragile while the recovery seen so far has been uneven across States, thanks to the virus’s unpredictable spread. The government has been conservative so far in its stimulus and support measures, despite which its fiscal math for 2020-21 will go awry. More direct and specific measures to help employment-intensive sectors, particularly those in distress such as travel and tourism or retail, are needed to ensure that further job losses today do not translate into tomorrow’s demand slump.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/choppy-tidings/article33235544.ece
03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Castes count||The idea of a caste census is back in the realm of public debate, following the Tamil Nadu government’s decision to establish a commission to collect caste-wise data. The move may have been born out of political expediency, in response to the restive pre-election agitation organised by the Pattali Makkal Katchi demanding 20% exclusive reservation in education and government jobs for the Vanniyar community, its main electoral base. However, it is equally true that there is a social and legal necessity for compiling caste-wise data. The Supreme Court has been asking States to produce quantifiable data to justify their levels of reservation, and it would help Tamil Nadu to retain its 69% total reservation. At the same time, some castes that have either electoral or numerical importance across India have been restive about the manner in which affirmative action programmes based on classes and communities have been implemented so far. Be it the Gujjars, or Jats or the Patidars, or the Vanniyars, some sections have been linking their prospects of advancement to exclusive reservation. In Tamil Nadu, sections of the Vanniyars, whose violent 1987-88 agitation resulted in the creation of a ‘most backward classes’ category entitled to 20% reservation, are apparently dissatisfied about being clubbed with over a hundred other castes. It is a sobering reflection on how reservation operates that some castes feel crowded out in the competition and aspire for the safety of exclusive reservation. The proposed commission may not conduct an elaborate enumeration on the lines of the Centre’s decennial census. Its mandate is to examine the methodology for collecting caste-wise particulars, conduct a survey based on that and submit a report. It will be quite a challenge to arrive at a sound assessment of the social and educational backwardness of each caste. The Census of India has not collected caste-wise data since 1931, with the exception of details about SCs and STs. The Centre conducted a ‘socio-economic caste census’ in 2011, in an attempt to link the collection of caste data along with socio-economic data so that there could be a comprehensive assessment of levels of deprivation and backwardness in society. However, presumably because of the lack of reliability of the data collected, or its political and electoral sensitivity, the caste portion of the SECC has not been disclosed so far. The State government could possibly seek access to this data pertaining to Tamil Nadu as part of its exercise. However, it should not treat this as a politically expedient move to quell a possible electoral setback due to the agitation of one party or community. Rather, it should seek to rationalise and deepen its social justice policy with a true assessment of the backwardness of various castes. After all, progress towards a casteless and equal society ought to remain the state’s ultimate goal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/castes-count/article33235545.ece

According to Mr. Nijalingappa, leadership should be evolved and not superimposed on any party. It was this that the Congress (O) Parliamentary Party Executive has endorsed. It is learnt that the issue was raised by Mrs. Yashoda Reddy who wanted a resolution to be adopted by the executive, but Dr. Ram Subhag Singh, who presided in the absence of Mr. Morarji Desai, tactfully avoided any discussion by pointing out that there was no need for any formal resolution as the Executive endorsed the party president’s stand.

03 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Industry tells SC govt.’s payback scheme on interest is ‘arbitrary’||Industry and business sectors complained to the Supreme Court on Wednesday that the government’s decision to restrict its payback scheme to “small” borrowers covering only eight categories of loans, worth up to Rs. 2 crore, was “arbitrary.” A Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan was hearing a host of pleas from various sectors for similar financial relief to help them overcome the stress caused by the pandemic and lockdown. So far, the payback scheme covers only MSME, education, housing, consumer durables, credit card, auto, personal and consumption loans. Under this scheme, lenders have already returned over Rs. 4,300 crore as the difference in the compound interest and simple interest charged between March 1 and August 31 (moratorium period). Ex-gratia payments had been made into 13.12 crore bank account as of November 13, the Supreme Court had noted from the government’s submission in a judgment on November 27. However, industrial and business sectors, classified as “big” borrowers, have been seeking industry-specific relief rather than being left to the mercy of individual lending institutions. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, for CREDAI, highlighted the need for the government and the Reserve Bank of India to understand the specific problems faced by each industry during the pandemic. Observing that some sectors such as pharma and digital platforms had done well during the lockdown, Mr. Sibal said others such as real estate and retail were in the doldrums. Clubbing distressed sectors with others would be a violation of Article 14 of the Constitution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/industry-tells-sc-govts-payback-scheme-on-interest-is-arbitrary/article33235530.ece

03 December 2020||London,||Injury-ravaged Liverpool advances||Curtis Jones sent a depleted Liverpool through to the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday, while Zinedine Zidane dismissed suggestions he might walk away from Real Madrid after another defeat by Shakhtar Donetsk left their European hopes in the balance. Liverpool was without a host of key players for the visit of Ajax to Anfield in Group D, with 22-year-old Irishman Caoimhin Kelleher starting in goal in the absence of the injured Alisson. Teenager Jones scored the only goal just before the hour, tucking the ball in after Ajax ‘keeper Andre Onana thought he could afford to let a Neco Williams cross sail over his head. Liverpool will go through as group winner after Atalanta had to come from behind to draw 1-1 at home to Midtjylland. Two-time former European champion Porto also sealed a last-16 spot after drawing 0-0 at home to Manchester City. Porto would have qualified regardless, because Olympiakos lost 2-1 to Marseille in France. Real Madrid could yet be consigned to the Europa League after it went down 2-0 to Shakhtar in Kiev, its second defeat this season by the Ukrainians with substitutes Dentinho and Manor Solomon scoring second-half goals. Gladbach is top by a point, while Shakhtar has the upper hand on Real thanks to its superior head-to-head record. However, the damage was limited for Real after Inter Milan won 3-2 away to Gladbach to keep its own hopes alive. Matteo Darmian put Inter ahead and Romelu Lukaku scored twice for Antonio Conte’s side. It means Inter is bottom of the group but could still qualify, while Real will definitely qualify as long as it wins at home to Gladbach. Tough for Atletico Real’s city rivals Atletico Madrid will also still have it all to do in its group game after being held to a 1-1 draw at home by a weakened Bayern Munich. Joao Felix gave Atletico the lead against a Bayern side which had already won Group A. Thomas Muller won and then converted a late penalty to earn the defending champion a draw.  The results:   Group A: Atletico Madrid 1 (Felix 26) drew with Bayern Munich 1 (Muller 86-pen); Lokomotiv Moscow 1 (Miranchuk 79-pen) lsot to Salzburg 3 (Berisha 28, 41, Adeyemi 81).   Group B: M’Gladbach 2 (Plea 45+1, 76) lost to Inter Milan 3 (Darmian 17, Lukaku 64, 73); Shakhtar Donetsk 2 (Dentinho 57, Solomon 82) bt Real Madrid 0.   Group C: Marseille 2 (Payet 55-pen, 75-pen) bt Olympiakos 1 (Camara 33); Porto 0 drew with Manchester City 0.   Group D: Atalanta 1 (Romero 79) drew with Midtjylland 1 (Scholz 13); Liverpool 1 (Jones 58) bt Ajax 0.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/injury-ravaged-liverpool-makes-the-pre-quarterfinals/article33235662.ece
03 December 2020||HYDERABAD,||HCA prefers holding only T20 competition||The Hyderabad Cricket Association prefers only the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 cricket championship to be held, according to its secretary R. Vijayanand. He told The Hindu that though a meeting — to be presided by the president Mohd Azharuddin — on Wednesday could not be held, it was decided unanimously over telephonic conversation to convey the same to the BCCI in this regard. Bio-bubble “We first wanted to test the bio-bubble which will be in place for the Mushatq Ali Trophy and plan accordingly,” he said. “In terms of playing facilities we are ready to host any big event but the unanimous opinion of the Apex Council is to start the season with a T20 tournament which will be far more easier to organise by implementing all the safety guidelines because of the pandemic,” the HCA official said. To wait for response “We will wait and see how the BCCI responds and comes out with the final schedule of domestic cricket. Since we have been asked the option, we preferred the T20 championship. May be by next week we should get a clear picture of how the domestic season would be,” Vijayanand said. COVID tests The HCA secretary also said that in coordination with the State Health Department players of all 18 teams who will be playing in the A-Division three-day tournament will get tested for COVID-19 at the Gymkhana Ground here on Thursday. “This is mandatory and anyone who tests positive will obviously not be entertained,” he said. “The format of the three-day league will be 90 and 40 overs each and once we get a feel about the way the league progresses, we will plan out a schedule for the other A-Division leagues too,” Vijayanand added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hca-prefers-holding-only-t20-competition/article33236207.ece
03 December 2020||Chennai,||Braveheart Natarajan’s rise — a triumph of the spirit||Natarajan’s success shows it is all right to dream and dream big. Natarajan’s, though, was no flight of fancy. His dream was backed by sweat, blood and titanic struggle. Son of a daily wage labourer, Natarajan came from Chinnappampatti, a hamlet near Salem. Cricket was an escape for him — from abject poverty — and it was in the dusty lanes of his village and with a tennis ball that he first learnt to bowl yorkers. Bowling is a lot about understanding your craft and, with the tennis ball, Natarajan learnt his release point, the most important element in bowling yorkers. High-risk delivery And it is this potent high-risk delivery — you require guts to bowl a sequence of it — that has catapulted him to the Indian cricket. And when Natarajan walked out with the Indian team for his first international game in Canberra’s quaint Manuka Oval, the occasion marked a triumph of the spirit. Natarajan, not showing any nerves on his debut, contributed to India’s 13-run ODI victory over Australia with two important wickets at vital stages; Marnus Labuschagne with a short-pitched delivery and then removing a battling Ashton Agar towards the end. Yes, his scorching yorkers were on view. And the manner Natarajan pulled himself back after an expensive over ‘at the death’ revealed his character. The 29-year-old Natarajan’s cricketing journey has been fascinating, every aspect of it; clinging on to cricket as his lifeline, bowling, astonishingly, with a cricket ball only at the age of 20. He then broke out of his poverty-stricken life, rose in the Tamil Nadu ranks, overcame problems with his bowling action, went for big money at the IPL auction but ran into injury hurdles for Kings XI Punjab and then came back strong this year for Sunrisers Hyderabad. He had filled up physically, upped his pace, and unleashed his yorkers, often six of them in an over, with great precision. Braveheart Natarajan’s tale is heart-warming. And it has only just begun.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/natarajans-rise-a-triumph-of-the-spirit/article33235628.ece
03 December 2020||Hamilton,||Windies ready for Kiwi challenge||The West Indies relished the freedom to be out-and-about in COVID-free New Zealand on the eve of the first Test in Hamilton on Wednesday, but said the pressure was on to be fully focused once the match starts. West Indies skipper Jason Holder said his Test squad bore little resemblance to the T20 side whipped 2-0 by New Zealand in the past week, and was much improved on the side crushed by 240 runs when it last played the longest format in Hamilton three years ago. “We’ve had some good success from then till now so I think the point for us is to just continue to build as a side,” Holder said as the West Indies trained on Tuesday about 15 metres from a very green Test wicket. Out of the bubble The visitors have revelled in finally being able to escape the bubble life that has confined many of them for most of the past five months as they played in England and then Dubai, which hosted the Indian Premier League, in empty stadiums because of the pandemic. New Zealand has a chance to play its way into the final of the World Test Championship if it sweeps the two Tests against the West Indies and the following two against Pakistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/windies-ready-for-kiwi-challenge/article33235816.ece
03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Eze thunderbolt denies Hyderabad FC||A bullet strike from Stephen Eze five minutes from time earned Jamshedpur FC a 1-1 draw against Hyderabad FC at the Tilak Maidan Stadium in Vasco on Wednesday. The defender’s thunderous drive from just inside the penalty area cancelled out Aridane Santana’s opener for Hyderabad early in the second half. Peter Hartley could have won it for Jamshedpur in the dying minutes, but his header from close range flew over the bar. The evening ended in agony for Hyderabad when coach Manuel Marquez was shown a red card for entering the pitch. The side will also be fretting over a hamstring injury to mainstay Santana, that resulted in the striker being stretchered off in the 80th minute. Going into the match, much depended on Hyderabad’s and Jamshedpur’s abilities to feed their respective target men, Santana and Nerijus Valskis. But neither player received the service he would have liked. The Hyderabad trio of Halicharan Narzary, Liston Colaco and Mohammed Yasir buzzed early on, but couldn’t find Santana. Valskis cut a frustrating figure too, unhappy with his teammates’ habit of hoofing the ball upfield aimlessly. Jamshedpur’s first chance came when Hyderabad goalie Laxmikant Kattimani was forced to tip over a fine first-time shot by Jackichand Singh on 24 minutes. Just before half-time, Hyderabad came close through Narzary, who cut in from the left-flank and drilled a shot that went off the far post. Hyderabad broke the deadlock on 50 minutes when Santana bundled in a rebound after Jamshedpur goalie Pawan Kumar made a mess of Narzary’s shot from the edge of the box. Controversy With 20 minutes left, controversy erupted when Jamshedpur was denied an equaliser. Kattimani tried to fist an incoming free-kick but it hit Santana and boomeranged into the goal. The referee disallowed it after deeming Hartley offside, but subsequent replays showed otherwise. Eze, however, ensured that Jamshedpur wouldn’t leave the pitch without a share of the spoils.  The result: Hyderabad FC 1 (Santana 50) drew with Jamshedpur FC 1 (Eze 85) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/eze-strike-denies-hyderabad-fc/article33235665.ece

03 December 2020||KOLKATA,||TMC rides on Shahbaz’s blitz||Captain Shahbaz Ahmed blasted a rapid half-century (51, 24b, 2×4, 5×6) as Tapan Memorial Club cruised to a five-wicket win over Mohun Bagan in the Bengal T20 Challenge at the Eden Gardens here on Wednesday. Opting to bat, Bagan aggregated 129 for five. TMC achieved the target with more than three overs to spare. Solid start Bagan had a solid start, thanks to the 68-run opening stand between left-hander Ankur Paul (39, 30b, 4x4, 2x6) and Sourav Paul (27, 39b, 2x4). Ankur was caught and bowled by off-spinner Vishal Singh and Sourav was run out in consecutive overs. TMC spinners, aided by Shahbaz’s sensational catching on the boundary, kept a tight leash on Bagan batsmen before Prince Yadav played a cameo knock (24 n.o., 13b, 2x4, 1x6), including 17 from the last over by seamer Nilkantha Das. TMC openers Gaurav Chauhan (33, 28b, 5x4) and Koushik Ghosh (20, 23b, 3x4) put on 51. Left-arm spinner Anurag Tiwari provided the breakthrough by trapping Chauhan in front in the eighth over. Koushik departed in the next. Shahbaz’s blistering innings took the match away from TMC.  The scores:   Mohun Bagan 129/5 in 20 overs (Ankur Paul 39) lost to Tapan Memorial Club 131/5 in 16.5 overs (Shahbaz Ahmed 51, Gaurav Chauhan 33, Vivek Singh 2/6, Anurag Tiwari 2/8).   On Tuesday: East Bengal 180/4 in 20 overs (Shreevats Goswami 65, Kanishk Seth 50 n.o., Sayan Mondal 33) bt Kalighat Club 122/7 in 20 overs (Jayojit Basu 42, Arnab Nandi 2/21, Sujit Yadav 2/31) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tmc-rides-on-shahbazs-blitz/article33235885.ece

03 December 2020||CHENNAI,||Srinath relieved to get online Olympiad medals||N. Srinath, who was the non-playing captain of the Indian chess team which won the online Olympiad gold in August this year, was relieved to receive the medals and certificates of each member on Wednesday, after quite an inordinate delay. The 26-year-old GM posted a tweet which read: “It wasn’t easy getting it! It reached from Russia to Chennai in three days, but took more than a week to reach from Bangalore to Chennai, and had to pay customs duty!” No communication Srinath said once the medals landed in Bengaluru airport, DHL (International courier) asked him for composition of the medals, and he apparently replied that they were not pure gold. “After that there was no proper communication from DHL,” he claimed. In fact, Srinath wrote a mail to Customs explaining what the medals meant and their composition and it worked, but why did the medals lie in Bengaluru airport for a week? “That I really don’t know and I don’t want to blame either Customs or DHL. But I should say that Bangalore Customs helped me,” Srinath told The Hindu here on Wednesday. Customs duty Add to that, he had to fork out Rs. 6300 as customs duty. “And FIDE (world chess body) will reimburse. Of course!” he tweeted. Srinath said, in normal circumstances, he should have got the medals on Nov. 23, but it reached him only on Dec. 2.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/srinath-relieved-to-get-medals/article33235657.ece

03 December 2020||CANBERRA,||The changes in the team brought freshness: Kohli||India captain Virat Kohli on Wednesday said the consolation win over Australia in the final ODI was made possible by the freshness that came with the changes in the squad. India included Shubman Gill, Kuldeep Yadav, Shardul Thakur and T. Natarajan in place of Mayank Agarwal, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Shami and Navdeep Saini. “We were put under the pump in the first half and in the second half of Australia’s innings but pulled through. Shubman (Gill) and others coming in brought freshness. The team needed that boost,” said Kohli at the post-match presentation. “Hopefully, we will take the momentum forward. I would have liked to bat for a bit longer, but it was a great partnership between Pandya and Jadeja.” Pandya said competing against a team like Australia can be a massive driving force. “It’s fantastic... you need to be on your toes to compete against Australia. I feel that you always have that extra edge in you when you play against Australia, you want to face up to that challenge,” he said. Australia skipper Aaron finch was pleased with the fight his team put up in the absence of senior players like opener David Warner, and the pace duo of Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins. “I thought we fought really well. It was a great partnership between Hardik and Jadeja. If we had got one of those wickets, we could have chased 240 maximum. Cameron Green (debutant) came in and made an impact with ball and bat, and showed he belongs here.”  Finch was also confident about Starc’s fitness for the T20I series beginning here on Friday. “Hopefully he’s (Starc) ready for the T20Is. It was just a niggle,” said the Australian skipper.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-changes-in-the-team-brought-freshness-kohli/article33235630.ece
03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Dismissing Smith early was huge, says Shardul||Shardul Thakur, who played a key role in India’s win in the third ODI against Australia on Wednesday, said he was thrilled to see the back of Steve Smith early. “For Smith, we had planned to bowl at the stumps. We were lucky as he edged behind on the leg-side. He’s a top player and getting him early on in the innings while defending 302 was a big moment,” said Shardul, who finished with three wickets, at a virtual media interaction. About his gameplan, he said, “The Australian batsmen had played the cut and pull shots a lot in the first two games. I just tried to keep them off those shots and make them play straighter. That worked.” Shardul said David Warner’s absence was felt by Australia. “We thought we could take advantage of his absence and put Australia on the backfoot.” Shardul was all praise for the bowling of debutant and fellow seamer T. Natarajan, who took two wickets. “In white-ball cricket, you are going to get hit as a bowler, but what is important is to come back, bowl again.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dismissing-smith-early-was-huge-says-shardul/article33235632.ece
03 December 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Chess Kerala to raise funds for its benevolent schemes||Chess Kerala (CK) will conduct a series of Open tournaments this month as a fund-raiser for its benevolent schemes. CK will conduct seven Grand Prix tournaments which will be followed by a grand finale. The first tournament is tentatively scheduled to begin in the second week of December. The grand finale will include top 100 players who will be selected based on their performances in the GP tournaments . CK plans to raise a corpus fund for its schemes from the registration fees and contributions from players and well-wishers. The fund will be used to help coaches and trainers who are struggling to make ends meet after being rendered jobless due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The minimum registration fee is Rs. 100 but players can generously contribute any amount of their choice to help the cause. “The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the coaches and trainers hard. Many of them who were working as trainers in rural areas have lost their jobs and are struggling to survive. It is the duty of Chess Kerala to help them in times of crisis,” said Professor Anilkumar, president of Chess Kerala. “But a majority of our coaches have not warmed up to the concept of online coaching. We are planning to hold a workshop on online coaching for our trainers. Chess Kerala will provide modem and will also foot the internet charges of those trainers who are willing to start online coaching. We are confident of raising a substantial amount from this tournament,” he said. Honouring the greats CK will also honour outstanding players from the past and also those officials who contributed selflessly for the growth of the game when chess had no public acceptance in Kerala. “We also intend to honour legends of Kerala chess. Kerala had some outstanding players whose career failed to take off for want of opportunities and patronage.During the tournament our website will carry paper cuttings, photographs of important events involving these legends. “To begin with we will highlight the contributions of seven individuals during our first tournament and more players and officials will be honoured in our subsequent tournaments,” Anilkumar added. S.H. Thangal (Kollam), K.C. Sebastian (Kottayam), T.K. Joseph (Kottayam) and A. Sasidharan (Kannur) will be honoured in the legends category while Antony Thyparambil (Ernakulam), Dr. Meenakshisundram (Palakkad) and K.P.R. Gopalan (Kannur) will be honoured in the Chess Architects category during the first GP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chess-kerala-to-raise-funds-for-its-benevolent-schemes/article33235821.ece
03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Acharyas show the path||We keep hearing that one should not fill one’s mind with unnecessary thoughts, but should think only of God. But we do not know how to meditate on God. We need guidance to keep away from the wrong path, and it is an Acharya, who shows us the path we have to take to attain moksha. A good Acharya is one who not only has jnana, but also observes all the prescribed anushtanas. We must go to such an Acharya, said Kidambi Narayanan in a discourse. Otherwise our minds will keep wandering, never dwelling on anything for long. A cow grazing on the banks of the Cauvery sees a patch of grass some distance away, and wanders to that place. It then sees another patch of grass somewhere else, and goes there. In the same way, the human mind jumps from one thing to another. That is why we need the guiding hand of an Acharya. Pillai Lokacharya, in his Srivachana Bhushanam, gives the example of a thirsty man, to emphasise the importance of guidance from an Acharya. The thirsty man approaches another with a request for some water to quench his thirst. The man says, “Dig up to hundred feet. You are sure to find water.” Another says, “Go to the milky ocean on which Vishnu reclines.” Yet another says, “Now we are in the midst of summer. Wait for three more months. The monsoon rains will begin, and then you will have plenty of water to drink.” Finally one man gives a sensible reply. He says, “In a pool on the banks of the Cauvery, there is water.” Only the reply of the last man was useful to the thirsty man. Likewise, only a good Acharya can lead us to Bhagavan. Samsara is like a desert. To escape, a man must approach God, as the thirsty man went to pool. The Acharya is like the man who showed the way to the pool.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/acharyas-show-the-path/article33235625.ece

03 December 2020||CAPE TOWN,||Malan, Buttler make it a no-contest||Dawid Malan and Jos Buttler launched a savage assault on South Africa's bowlers as England completed a series clean sweep with a nine-wicket win in the third and final Twenty20 international at Newlands in Cape Town on Tuesday. Malan finished on 99 not out, while Buttler was unbeaten on 67. They shared a World record T20 international second wicket partnership of 167 off 90 balls to make South Africa’s 191 for three look insignificant. New high Malan, voted man-of-the-match and series, has set a ranking-points record for batsmen in international Twenty20 cricket after smashing 173 runs in England’s whitewash. The 33-year-old left-hander now has 915 points in the International Cricket Council rankings. Australia’s Aaron Finch held the previous record with exactly 900 points and he remains third on the updated list, behind second-placed Babar Azam of Pakistan. Earlier, Rassie van der Dussen (74 not out) and Faf du Plessis (52 not out) set up South Africa’s biggest total of the series in an unbeaten partnership of 127 off 66 balls for the fourth wicket.  The scores: South Africa 191/3 in 20 overs (Bavuma 32, du Plessis 52 n.o., van der Dussen 74 n.o., Stokes 2/26) lost to England 192/1 in 17.4 overs (Buttler 67 n.o., Malan 99 n.o.).

03 December 2020||Melbourne,||Oz Open delayed to Feb. 8: report||The Australian Open tennis Grand Slam will start three weeks late on February 8, reports said on Wednesday, with players cleared to train during quarantine following lengthy negotiations with state authorities. According to Australian media, the start date was announced to players by tournament director Craig Tiley. If confirmed, it will join the three other major tournaments in being disrupted by the coronavirus. Protracted talks Tennis Australia has been in protracted talks with Victoria state authorities in Melbourne, which only emerged from a months-long lockdown in October following a second wave of cases. Great news “It's taken a while, but the great news is it looks like we are going to be able to hold the AO (Australian Open) on 8 February,” Tiley was quoted as telling players in a leaked letter. “Players will have to quarantine for two weeks from 15 January, but the Victorian government has agreed to special conditions for AO participants — agreeing that they need to be able to prepare for a Grand Slam.” Under the plan, players who test negative for the virus will be able to train while in isolation, Tiley wrote. Tennis Australia did not confirm the reports on Wednesday, and said plans were still awaiting approval from the state government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/oz-open-from-feb-8-report/article33235672.ece

03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||He says, she says||When Filpkart Video approached Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia Deshmukh for Ladies Vs Gentlemen that seeks gender-based answers to a range of questions, they sensed an opportunity to voice their thoughts. Riteish, however, says that the show is not about what they think is right, but about what “India is thinking”. The format of the show is simple: each episode has three opinion-based questions. The panellists and viewers are given 15 seconds to answer following which their responses are revealed along with the collective opinion of the public, known as ‘India’s opinion’. When it came to hosting the show, Riteish says that there was not a question of tonality since the questions themselves would evoke a certain kind of reaction from viewers, who come from different walks of life. “Some of the questions were fun and some were thought-provoking. And there were taboo questions that were meant to be discussed. We [Genelia and I] represent a cross-section of India. Through the questions, we were able to gauge where India was tilting,” says Riteish over a Zoom call from Mumbai, along with his wife. Genelia chips in to add that Ladies Vs Gentlemen , launched on November 18 on the Flipkart app, does not offer solutions. It is more about exchanging perspectives. “Even with us, we share different viewpoints and that is always respected,” she adds. Being a couple has not changed or influenced their perspectives on gender, for, Genelia feels that they are not too gender-specific about their roles as parents. “For us, it is not a question of whether it is a man’s job or woman’s... it is more of who does it better. We give that space for each other,” she says, adding, “So, when Riteish sits down with kids to teach, I am not around because it is his time. We, as a couple, have evolved in what the kids have taught us.” Given that they are actors working in an industry that has become a breeding ground for gender stereotypes, would they discuss some of their personal experiences on the show? “Since most of us in the panel are in the film and entertainment industry, yes, it comes back to our experiences,” says Riteish. Genelia, however, gives a measured response: “I haven’t had too many experiences that were gender-biased.” That said, the larger goal, according to Riteish, was to open up certain subjects for viewers and make them feel okay to be discussed in reality. “There have been times where we haven’t given our opinions as a couple in public. What was more interesting was to hear feedback from people. We thought there was a clear distinction between the way men and women think. But we were mostly wrong.” The show made Genelia realise how much she misses work. Although she says she wouldn’t give up being a homemaker for anything, “There is also a part of me that is creatively interested in films. I didn’t want to be unfair to someone who signed me for a film. That is why I took the break. Now the kids are a little older... I have reached a stage where I am ready. Plus, there is so much that today’s cinema offers,” says Genelia, who made a comeback this year with It’s My Life , a Hindi remake of the Telugu comedy Bommarillu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/he-says-she-says/article33236090.ece
03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Masks over capes||“I sense a quiet fear here,” Sahas says, as she and Priya fly over the city: desolated streets stretch as far as their eyes reach. Priya remarks, “Everyone is hiding in their houses,” as Sahas continues, “It seems as though time has stopped.” India’s first female superhero, Priya, and her trusted flying tiger Sahas, find themselves amid a global, ongoing crisis: COVID-19. Priya’s Mask is the newest edition of the Augmented Reality comic book series featuring the teenage, female superhero. For the first time, it is accompanied by an animated short film. Voiced by actors from India and the US (Mrunal Thakur as Priya, Vidya Balan and Rosanna Arquette as Sahas and Sairah Kabir as eight-year-old Meena), the film visually narrates a segment from the comic, set against the city of Jodhpur. The series began with Priya’s Shakti (2014) after the gang rape of a young woman on a bus in New Delhi in 2012. This was followed by Priya’s Mirror, where Priya joined forces with a group of acid attack survivors; and Priya and the Lost Girls (2019), where she tackled sex trafficking. “Priya, as a character, has evolved since 2014. Initially it was based on Hindu mythology, but now it’s much more universal in the storytelling. But the principle idea of Priya conquering fear remains a critical part of the storyline,” says Ram Devineni, creator of the character, a documentary filmmaker and technologist based in New York.  Priya’s Mask is meant for a younger audience, unlike previous editions. This led to the “softening” of Priya, as a character, Ram adds. Her superpower — the power of persuasion — still remains intact. There is an evident “style-shift” with this chapter. “Priya is responding to children and how they cope (with the pandemic),” says Shubhra Prakash, the writer, adding that children get affected the most by a crisis of this scale. A lot of the time, parents struggle to justify decisions to not let them meet their friends or play outdoors. Such demands often leave children confused which is what Priya tries to tackle. Actor Mrunal Thakur of Super 30 fame, who voiced Priya in the film, says, “People are talking about the economy, GDP, laws… but are we even considering children and their mental health? ” Explaining the pandemic to children is a challenge in itself. Shubhra says, “As adults, we know that we also experienced good things: like clean air, revitalised Nature. It can get complicated while talking about it to a child. So we tried to counter that by showing Sahas and her family in the forest or the birds coming to the city.” Ram says that a pointed effort was made to debunk the stigma that is associated with the pandemic. “We wanted to get at misinformation: things like ‘only people from disadvantaged sections get the virus’. The fear of the virus is as dangerous as the virus itself,” he says.

03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Ten points for slithering||The Raorchestes resplendens or the resplendent shrubfrog lives up to its name. An iridescent blob of colour amid foliage, it is a striking mix of orange and purplish-black. This critically endangered frog found in Anaimudi, the highest peak in the Western Ghats, has an unexpectedly loyal fan following. Every South West Monsoon, as the evergreen forests are drenched in rain, people travel from afar just to catch a glimpse of the resplendens. Hadlee Renjith, a naturalist and Kerala Tourism guide in Munnar, even named his travel company after the frog – Resplendent Experiences. “It was my dream to find this rare frog in the wild and when I finally got to see one, its beauty struck me,” he says. The resplendens is not the only star amphibian of the Western Ghats. Other frogs, snakes, lizards and reptiles here have a growing fan base. Herping, the act of watching amphibians and reptiles, has caught on over the past three years, says Hadlee, who has been flooded with enquiries from travellers, especially after the onset of COVID-19. The growing popularity of macro-photography has spiked interest in herping. Hobby photographers, confined to their homes during the pandemic, have taken to clicking pictures of insects and arachnids up close. For them, a herping tour with a field guide is an exciting prospect. Reptile and amphibian enthusiasts often go to great lengths just to observe these secretive creatures in their natural habitats. Sandeep Das from Thrissur has been visiting the Western Ghats every monsoon since 2011 to watch the purple frog, an elusive, endangered species that lives underground. “They come out only once in a year to lay eggs and, therefore we call them the Mahabali (the mythical King of Kerala who lives in the netherworld and visits his people once every year) frogs,” says Sandeep. A research scholar at the Kerala Forest Research Institute and a research fellow at the Zoological Society of London, Sandeep studies frogs and snakes out of pure passion. “We usually travel to Idukki and the Thrissur Forest Division, around May-June and stay around for a week to watch them come out,” he adds. The photographs herpers take help in creating awareness about rare species and dispel myths about snakes and amphibians. “People understand that it is not just the bigger animals that make up the wild. These little creatures too are a vital part of the ecosystem,” says Sandeep, who is also a macro-photographer. Award-winning wildlife photographer R Prakash says there are many undiscovered species of amphibians at every elevation of the Western Ghats, which stretches from Swamithope in Tamil Nadu, up to Songadh town in Gujarat. “In Valparai alone, there are over 10 varieties of frogs and snakes such as the large-scaled pit viper and Malabar pit viper,” he says. Prakash has camped at Amboli in Maharashtra to photograph the Amboli bushfrog and cicada molting with its purple and blue wings. The good place Technical architect Uday Hegde based in Bengaluru has travelled to almost all the forests in the Western Ghats and across the North East, to watch frogs and reptiles. He takes off on weekends, armed with his DSLR camera fitted with a macro lens, and is often accompanied by his herper friends.“We just sit next to these snakes and observe them. Photographing them is one thing, but we are more interested in the creatures than getting the perfect frame. We also try to keep the flashes to a minimum so as not to startle them,” he adds. Herpers start work by 6 pm, and the outing could last up to 1 am. Experienced herpers know the habitats, behaviour and food habits of the creatures, and where to spot them. Chennai-based naturalist Yuvan Aves has just completed a virtual urban wilderness walk on his Instagram. An active member of the of Madras Naturalists Society, he took people on a virtual tour of Perungudi Station Road, which was originally a marshland. “When it rains, dragonflies and damselflies start gathering around puddles and marshes, laying eggs, and patrolling around. Rains are good for moths, frogs and toads, and snakes as they break their dormancy and come out,” says Yuvan, who has recorded over 200 species of moths as a part of year-long study at Adyar Poonga. Teaching tourists Travellers generally have now become a little more appreciative of flora and fauna, says Praveen Muraleedharan, founder of Nectar Experience, a chain of eco-resorts in Kerala. “More people have started to show interest in specific herps,” says Praveen. The resorts at Marayoor, Nilambur, Munnar, Chinnar, Coorg, Wayanad and Thattekkad have naturalists who guide visitors through the rich biodiversity of the region. Praveen’s project, Team Eco Ventures, offers photography tours too, which help those interested in macro photography to find their favourite herps and click them. The Windermere Estate at Munnar and Riverhouse at Neriyamangalam have a naturalist, who takes visitors on herping tours and macro photography. Situated in a 60-acre coffee and cardamom plantation, the estate offers ample scope for herping. Though primarily in the leisure spot, Windermere is exploring possibilities in herping and birding as both properties are situated on the Western Ghats and are rich in biodiversity, says Dr Simon John of Windermere. Conservationist H Byju says such focussed tours eventually pave the way for conservation. “During the pandemic, people are setting out to watch small mammals too, like hedgehogs on the fringes of reserve forests in Satyamangalam and in places such as Ayalur near Madurai. There are exclusive tours to watch Slender lorises in Kallar near Mettupalayam. The experience makes them think about conservation.” As Yuvan says, watching creepy crawlies is a powerful way to connect with other life forms that live on plants, trees, in little pockets and cracks of cement... all sharing space with us.

03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||A digital début for Sania||For Sania Mirza, 2019 was all about getting back in shape to make her comeback on the court. Following the birth of her son Izhaan in 2018, she was ready to take the tennis world by storm again in 2020. And if her hard-fought victory in January this year — at the WTA Hobart International doubles with Ukrainian player Nadiia Kichenok — was any indication, she would have succeeded, too. But COVID-19 outbreak put all her plans on the backburner. However, the six-time Grand Slam winner has kept busy; this past week she débuted on television, joining the cast ofMTV Nishedh Alone Togetheras a radio host. The digital mini series revolves around the awareness and management of Tuberculosis (TB) with a focus on the pandemic. “When I was approached for this project, I honestly did not know much about TB,” admits Sania, responding via e-mail from Dubai, UAE, where she is currently training. “I just knew a few people who have been through it and got cured because they got the right help at the right time,” she adds. She then researched a great deal about TB. “The stats were alarming. There are about 2.7 million cases in India annually, and at least five lakh are not even reported due to the lack of awareness about symptoms, besides myths and societal stigmas.” Given that COVID-19 also attacks the lungs, she points out that the pandemic further affects India’s TB control efforts. “The adversity of the virus and the subsequent restriction on movement has also affected people who are not able to seek the required help. The symptoms of TB and COVID-19 are similar. So, if someone has an induced cough and has tested negative for COVID-19, I urge them to not be ignorant and get tested for TB,” she says. The series will see her talking about the importance of maintaining relationships even when being physically apart from loved ones. Much of this year for Sania was spent away from her husband, Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik, as she and son stayed back at her home, in Hyderabad. “Yes, it was difficult to stay away from my husband for a long period of time. Initially, when the nationwide lockdown was imposed, there was a lot of uncertainty about how we will manage things but I guess that happened to everybody. The best way was to be at home and ensure everyone’s safety, especially my toddler’s,” she says. The family reunited in Dubai in September, in time for both her and her son’s birthdays. Recently, she penned an open letter in support of Serena Williams and other mothers playing at the highest level of their respective sports. She describes how she lost 26 kilograms to come back to tennis “because that’s what I know, love and do.” Back on track Though Sania is unsure when her next tournament will be, her training is back on track. “I am high on fitness. But yes, I haven’t hit the court as much as I would have loved to, and undeniably, the regimen is not the same as when you train to hit the court.” Even as top tennis players including Novak Djokovic contracted COVID-19 (in June), Sania had already made the decision not to play in the interest of her family. “Right now, I need to think as a parent and not just an athlete,” she says. Her two-year-old is now the centre of her universe. Thankful for the rare, quality time with her family, Sania has been spending most of her days recording playdates and workouts with her son in tow. She also created an Instagram account for him, which, incidentally, already has over 52,000 followers. “Since March, my child and I have spent every single day together and to watch him grow has been the most beautiful thing,” she says. MTV Nishedh Alone Together streams every Friday on the Facebook, YouTube and Instagram handles of MTV and MTV Nishedh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-digital-dbut-for-sania/article33236101.ece
03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||The man who built a forest||I take a 20-minute boat ride from the Baghmora camp site in Jorhat, Assam, followed by a 45-minute trek to meet ‘The Forest Man of India,’ Jadav Payeng. With me on the boat is Munmuni Payeng, Jadav’s daughter. As the boat approaches Molai forest in Majuli, Munmuni says, “This is where the forest begins. After we reach the shore, we trek through bushes and tall grass. Hope you are game.” I am. When we reach the shore, Munmuni warns me about stepping into soft mud on the low lands of the river bank and suggests I follow her. We make a path through the jungle, brushing aside branches and cobwebs with sticks. Though the walk is long, the spectacular view of trees, unpolluted sky, different kinds of birds at every 500 yards, and freshness in the air keep me going. Finally, we see a patch of land fenced with bamboo sticks. Munmuni points and says, “Deuta(dad) is busy weeding the potato bed.” Doing the impossible 65-year-old Jadav Payeng was conferred the title ‘The Forest Man’ in Delhi by the Government of India on World Earth Day in 2010, for turning a barren land of 550 hectares (over 1300 acres) into a lush green forest all by himself. It took close to 30 years for the land to turn into a forest and Jadav is protective about it. He started planting in 1979 and continues doing that even today. The locals call it Molai as a tribute to Jadav. He says, “As a child, I was fair and had pink cheeks just like the winter radish. So my pet name was Mola (radish in the local language). As I grew up and started planting trees, people started calling it Mola’r haabi (Mola’s forest). From there, someone conveniently made it Molai forest.” Jadav, however, refuses to take credit. “The birds, cows, deer, wind, water and elephants have helped me.” Dressed in a traditional handmade Mising gamusa and singlet, Jadav asks us to go ahead, so we wait in aneatly swept shed made of bamboo, clay and cow dung. A large wooden log from a fallen tree, resting on two sturdy stumps, serves as a bench. Seeing visitors, Jadav’s farm assistants light a small woodfire. His hands and feet are still covered in mud when Jadav joins us. “People want to know my story. I tell them I just plant trees, and I’d like all of you to do so. Trees are the lifeline of the forest. They don’t just give us shade and oxygen. They feed birds and animals and balance our eco system. If there is no life left, what is the use of all the advancements we have made?” Discussing why he started planting trees, Jadav adds how, as a child, he watched ships ferry goods to Kolkata and Dhaka. “Between 1965 and 1970 all of it was washed away by the Brahmaputra. An erosion of 10 kilometres happened and Mohgorh Khuti turned into a desert. I wanted a forest here, so I built a small boat and started planting saplings. People first thought I was crazy. But I didn’t give up on the saplings and came back every day to see their progress.” He continues, “My boat is as old as my forest. I still carry saplings in it every day.” Taking responsibility As a child, Jadav met Jadabesh Barua, an agricultural scientist, who used to give him saplings of paan leaves to be planted, and 25 paise. “In those days 25 paise bought close to 1.5 kilograms of groundnut and it made me happy. Barua one day took my hand and said ‘plant trees and they will take care of all of us’. So, when I saw my Majuli turning into a desert, I decided to do what I was asked to do by a scientist.” Ever since Jadav’s story went viral in 2010, he has travelled across the country, and the world, to give talks and attend conferences on climate change and environmental issues. “It will be a beautiful thing if a child is taught to plant a sapling or a seed when he is initiated in school and as he grows up, he or she is taught to take care of it and be responsible for it.” But wherever he goes, his heart beats for his home. “No matter where I go, I long to come back to my forest,” he says. “Everything abroad is beautiful, spic and span but there is no place like my forest. People spend money to see tigers, rhinos and elephants. I get to see them in their home, for free.” This also means adapting to the ways of the forest. “Once we were having lunch when a leopard dragged three buffaloes away. We don’t interfere when wild animals take our livestock,” he says, adding, “And when you encounter a herd of elephants, it is wise to hide. Only a fool would want to stand in front of an elephant.” Pointing to a tree laden with wild lemons, Jadav says, “This lemon tree is a favourite of the elephants. We make sure it is well watered and taken care of so they can eat to their hearts content.”  Taking a leaf Director Prabhu Solomon’s new film, poised to release mid-January 2021, has a central character inspired by Jadav Payeng. The trilingual film titled Kaadan in Tamil, Haathi Mere Saathi in Hindi and Aranya in Telugu, stars Rana Daggubati as a man who lives in the jungle. Is Jadav excited? He says, “If the movie makes people start loving trees, I will be delighted. I don’t mind if anyone makes monetary gains out of my story or through me. Only request I have is... do not gamble.” Despite the upcoming movie, and the fact that he is now in school text books, Jadav does not see himself as a celebrity, nor does he care about the laurels he has earned. “Reading about me is not enough. Do what I do. I want school teachers to follow up on my chapter with tree-planting sessions, and to teach children to nurture and grow them with love and care,” he says.   People want to know my story. I tell them I just plant trees, and I’d like all of you to do so. If there is no life left, what is the use of all the advancements we have made?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-man-who-built-a-forest/article33236106.ece
03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||A good year||“It looks like 2020 is going to be a beautiful vintage. But, till you pick the grapes you never know,” says Fratelli’s Alessio Secci. Lessons in wine, and lessons for life. After all, who would have thought a wine dinner would involve Alessio opening his bottle of Sette in Tuscany, along with sommeliers in Delhi and Chennai, while members of Terroir — The Madras Wine Club balanced their individual bottles along with phones, laptops, glasses and Peshawari kebabs at home. Despite the pandemic, accompanied by lockdowns, the unfamiliar need for physical distancing and an ever-lurking fear of infection, people around the world are finding ways to connect, even if it means moving most of their lives online. President of Terroir and jewellery designer, Minnie Menon, with her unflagging energy, reminiscent of a just-popped bottle of champagne, was determined to bring the club together so she joined hands with Fratelli wine and the ITC Grand Chola to host Chennai’s first virtual wine dinner. As laptops power up, the hotel’s chauffeurs ferry hampers across the city, with a menu curated to accompany Fratelli’s popular Sette, starting from brie and olives to Peshawari’s signature black dal, biryani and phirni. Launching the event on Zoom from her home, Minnie speaks about the resurgent spirit of celebrating local products: Sette, for instance, is an unexpected Indian success story, built on barren land and steely determination. “It was hard work,” says Alessio, explaining how Fratelli was founded with the vision of bottling Indian terroir. “When we moved to Akluj (Maharashtra), it was like planning vineyards in the Grand Canyon. We wanted land that was not too fertile — it means that yield is less, but there is more energy and flavour concentrated in the grape.” Fratelli, which means brothers in Italian, is a family affair, adds Alessio, explaining how it was conceived by three sets of brothers: Alessio and Andrea Secci, the Mohite-Patel brothers Ranjit and Arjun, as well as Gaurav and the late Kapil Sekhri. Sette is their attempt to create a wine in the style of Italy’s Super Tuscans, “A super Indian,” as Alessio puts it. For the tasting, participants uncork the 2017 vintage, a blend of Sangiovese and cabernet sauvignon grapes, in a 60:40 ratio blended by Italian winemaker Piero Masi. Powerful, with a vibrant acidity from the Sangiovese, and a elegant fruitiness from the cabernet sauvignon, the wine is laced with a woody vanilla echo from the French oak it is aged in. Led by sommelier Harshith Prabhu, resplendent in his Salvador Dali moustache, participants swirl and sip the red wine, admiring its “deep ruby core”. Harshith states, with a grin, “It reminds me of gardens with roses. Kids with citrus candy... there is so much of nostalgia, and warmth from the sun that the grapes have soaked up.” “Our wines are an expression of the rocky, sandy soil. The microclimate of the plot, the conditions of the weather that year,” says Alessio. He adds, “Yes, there is a style of Sette that doesn’t change. But each vintage will taste different. Every year is a new masterpiece.” Yes. Even 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-good-year/article33236100.ece
03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Upskilling, a life hack||“Being in their own environment helps neurodiverse people, including those with Autism and Down Syndrome, perform better. Remote working conditions are ideal for them, so, it makes sense that they do their learning remotely as well,” says Manu Sekar, the founder of HashHack Code. Over the past few months, this informal, Chennai-based outfit has been familiarising its special needs students with the basics of coding through online classes, uninterrupted by lockdown. Manu’s surmise is neither idle nor overambitious: he mentions proudly a former student who recently launched his own web services business. “We currently have 45 students from eight to 34 years old,” he says, adding that each student is taught individually through one-on-one online sessions, the format for which is deliberately kept open-ended. The key, he stresses, lies in understanding each individual’s pace of learning, “and letting them set the pace for us”. With the flow This is something HashHack Code has been doing even before they set out to teach people with special needs. “In 2016-17, we had begun by working with marginalised women — upskilling them, teaching them coding and finding them jobs,” says Manu, adding, “One of our clients back then had a daughter with autism, who was interested in learning code. A couple of other parents, too, wanted to see if we could help [teach their children].” From that first student, to three more, to 45 now, the team took their time taking new pupils. “We did not have any research on autism, or how to teach people with autism. We just tried to understand each person’s needs and went with that,” Manu states. So it is not a formal education programme, but it does teach the students enough to provide for some employment options. Since the setup is an informal one, HashHack Code operates not with “teachers”, but with “mentors”, a lot of whom are college students. An advantage of having student mentors, Manu says, is in the rapport that is struck between the one who learns and the one who teaches. “It is not a student-teacher relationship that we try to project. We prefer a peer-learning environment. Especially among our older students, being helped in their projects by someone closer to their age makes them feel comfortable and learn faster.” Projects are many, since HashHack code believes in experiential learning instead of lectures, and teaches its students by making them practically try things out. “This format translated more easily to online learning, when we made the switch during lockdown,” adds Manu. Manu is hopeful that this system helps the mentor. “Most of them are with us for about six to eight months, and will be joining official workplaces soon. I hope that having worked with neurodiverse people makes them more sensitive colleagues. The idea is for them to develop empathy and acceptance before joining the workforce.” Understanding different needs and helping people fit into the workforce, he points out, is an important trait, even if it isn’t a technical skill.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/upskilling-a-life-hack/article33236105.ece
03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Mariah Carey and Christmas: A match made in the North Pole||She is the undisputed queen of Christmas, and has been so — for 26 years and counting — ever since her fourth studio album Merry Christmas dropped in 1994, and ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You’ became one of the best-selling singles in history. The holiday song is etched deep in global folklore today — it is impossible to imagine December without it — and Carey continues calling it “her gift to the world”. This year, the singer-songwriter-actor is back with “another gift”, her Christmas special on Apple TV+. Titled Magical Christmas Special , the show features her and a starry line-up of her superstar friends: Tiffany Haddish, Billy Eichner, Ariana Grande, Jennifer Hudson, Snoop Dogg and Jermaine Dupri to mention a few. The special will drop on the streaming platform on December 4, and will release along with the soundtrack single and music video for ‘Oh Santa!,’ co-written by and featuring Carey with Ariana Grande and Jennifer Hudson. This comes just months after the singer’s memoir The Meaning of Mariah Carey debuted at #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list in September. Talking to us on a Zoom call from her home in the US, Carey looks as resplendent as ever. It is around 3 am in the morning where she lives, and she is diva personified, complete with a therapy dog nestling on her glittery dress as she begins the interview. Excerpts from a conversation: Would you say that your Magical Christmas Special is more anticipated than ever now because the world desperately needs a great holiday? It’s been my biggest dream to be able to share this with the world. The goal was to just do the most festive special possible. Thankfully, we were able to finish this while going through COVID as we conceptualised it earlier. While working on it, we did a lot of exploring in my vault, and there is another Christmas song in there too, which will be a surprise for sometime later. It has definitely been a nostalgic period for me. My memoir has taken me to a different place, as I went through that creative experience with my collaborator Michaela Angela Davis for over three years to finish it. It’s been fantastic seeing the response today, and now I’m waiting for a filmed version of it. I really hope the fans will enjoy my book and special for now. What was the working process like, collaborating with the likes of Ariana Grande?    Ariana Grande, J-Hud (Jennifer Hudson) and I were so excited about coming together for ‘Oh Santa’. The song required more of me as a producer to structure it for three voices. Snoop (Dogg) came on board at the last minute and surprised me with what he did. For me, personally, the greatest challenge right now is being open-minded and open to exploring all styles of music. All kinds of artistes reach out to me, and we have to get into that creative zone together. We can’t try too hard to make a hit; it has to happen organically. Mariah Carey and Christmas have gone hand-in-hand over the past two decades — what does the festival mean to you, especially in 2020?  Well, I absolutely enjoy the over-the-top aspect of it! But you have to love the spirit of the holiday first; only then you get to experience it fully and have it resonate with you. I know it will be different this year because of the pandemic. But I still look forward to sitting in bed, sipping on a hot chocolate and watching a Christmas movie surrounded by my close-knit family. I will miss being at shows, being around people of all ages, religions and races, kids with their parents. I’m already missing the hustle and bustle of the holiday season, the presents, et al. But like I say in my song, the lyrics literally go that I don't care about my presents under the tree. It’s not only about the grandeur, it’s about the spirit. Talking about ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You’, the anthem celebrated its 25th anniversary last year. What is your perception of the song today?  It’s been an interesting journey with it; the first Christmas song I ever wrote it. I’ve grown into falling in love with it more over the years. People really have connected with it in a way that I never expected. Finally, what would you like to tell all the women who look up to you as an icon in the industry today?  The goal of writing my book was to emancipate my inner child, it was for that little girl who felt shy, scared and alone. Don't think of yourself as second best. Always believe that it’s possible. It was never only about me wanting to be famous or rich; it was always about believing in myself. You wouldn’t even have heard of me if I’d given up early on! We are all a work-in-progress, but we just have to be as strong as possible and we will make it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/mariah-carey-and-christmas-a-match-made-in-the-north-pole/article33236104.ece

03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Masks over capes||“I sense a quiet fear here,” Sahas says, as she and Priya fly over the city: desolated streets stretch as far as their eyes reach. Priya remarks, “Everyone is hiding in their houses,” as Sahas continues, “It seems as though time has stopped.” India’s first female superhero, Priya, and her trusted flying tiger Sahas, find themselves amid a global, ongoing crisis: COVID-19. Priya’s Mask is the newest edition of the Augmented Reality comic book series featuring the teenage, female superhero. For the first time, it is accompanied by an animated short film. Voiced by actors from India and the US (Mrunal Thakur as Priya, Vidya Balan and Rosanna Arquette as Sahas and Sairah Kabir as eight-year-old Meena), the film visually narrates a segment from the comic, set against the city of Jodhpur. The series began with Priya’s Shakti (2014) after the gang rape of a young woman on a bus in New Delhi in 2012. This was followed by Priya’s Mirror, where Priya joined forces with a group of acid attack survivors; and Priya and the Lost Girls (2019), where she tackled sex trafficking. “Priya, as a character, has evolved since 2014. Initially it was based on Hindu mythology, but now it’s much more universal in the storytelling. But the principle idea of Priya conquering fear remains a critical part of the storyline,” says Ram Devineni, creator of the character, a documentary filmmaker and technologist based in New York.  Priya’s Mask is meant for a younger audience, unlike previous editions. This led to the “softening” of Priya, as a character, Ram adds. Her superpower — the power of persuasion — still remains intact. There is an evident “style-shift” with this chapter. “Priya is responding to children and how they cope (with the pandemic),” says Shubhra Prakash, the writer, adding that children get affected the most by a crisis of this scale. A lot of the time, parents struggle to justify decisions to not let them meet their friends or play outdoors. Such demands often leave children confused which is what Priya tries to tackle. Actor Mrunal Thakur of Super 30 fame, who voiced Priya in the film, says, “People are talking about the economy, GDP, laws… but are we even considering children and their mental health? ” Explaining the pandemic to children is a challenge in itself. Shubhra says, “As adults, we know that we also experienced good things: like clean air, revitalised Nature. It can get complicated while talking about it to a child. So we tried to counter that by showing Sahas and her family in the forest or the birds coming to the city.” Ram says that a pointed effort was made to debunk the stigma that is associated with the pandemic. “We wanted to get at misinformation: things like ‘only people from disadvantaged sections get the virus’. The fear of the virus is as dangerous as the virus itself,” he says.

03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Ten points for slithering||The Raorchestes resplendens or the resplendent shrubfrog lives up to its name. An iridescent blob of colour amid foliage, it is a striking mix of orange and purplish-black. This critically endangered frog found in Anaimudi, the highest peak in the Western Ghats, has an unexpectedly loyal fan following. Every southwest monsoon, as the evergreen forests are drenched in rain, people travel from afar just to catch a glimpse of the resplendens. Hadlee Renjith, a naturalist and Kerala Tourism guide in Munnar, has named his travel company after the frog — Resplendent Experiences. “It was my dream to find this rare frog in the wild and when I finally got to see one, its beauty struck me,” he says. The resplendens is not the only star amphibian of the Western Ghats. Other frogs, snakes, lizards, and reptiles here have a growing fan base. Herping, the act of watching amphibians and reptiles, has caught on over the past three years, says Hadlee, who has been flooded with enquiries from travellers, especially after the outbreak of COVID-19. The growing popularity of macro-photography has spiked interest in herping. Hobby photographers, confined to their homes during the pandemic, have taken to clicking pictures of insects and arachnids up close. For them, a herping tour with a field guide is an exciting prospect. Reptile and amphibian enthusiasts often go to great lengths just to observe these secretive creatures in their natural habitats. Sandeep Das from Thrissur has been visiting the Western Ghats every monsoon since 2011 to watch the purple frog, an elusive, endangered species that lives underground. “They come out only once in a year to lay eggs and, therefore we call them the Mahabali (the mythical king of Kerala who lives in the netherworld and visits his people once every year) frogs,” says Sandeep. A research scholar at the Kerala Forest Research Institute and research fellow at the Zoological Society of London, Sandeep studies frogs and snakes out of pure passion. “We usually travel to Idukki and the Thrissur Forest Division, around May-June and stay around for a week to watch them come out,” he adds. The photographs herpers take help in creating awareness of rare species and dispel myths about snakes and amphibians. “People understand that it is not just the bigger animals that make up the wild. These little creatures too are a vital part of the ecosystem,” says Sandeep, who is also a macro-photographer. Award-winning wildlife photographer R. Prakash says there are many undiscovered species of amphibians at every elevation of the Western Ghats, which stretches from Swamithope in Tamil Nadu, up to Songadh town in Gujarat. “In Valparai alone, there are over 10 varieties of frogs and snakes such as the large-scaled pit viper and Malabar pit viper,” he says. Prakash has camped at Amboli in Maharashtra to photograph the Amboli bushfrog and cicada molting with its purple and blue wings. The good place Technical architect Uday Hegde, who is based in Bengaluru, has travelled to almost all the forests in the Western Ghats and across the Northeast, to watch frogs and reptiles. He takes off on weekends, armed with his DSLR camera fitted with a macro lens, and is often accompanied by his herper friends. “We just sit next to these snakes and observe them. Photographing them is one thing, but we are more interested in the creatures than getting the perfect frame. We also try to keep the flashes to a minimum so as not to startle them,” he adds. Herpers start work by 6 p.m., and the outing could last up to 1 a.m. Experienced herpers know the habitats, behaviour and food habits of the creatures, and where to spot them. Chennai-based naturalist Yuvan Aves has just completed a virtual urban wilderness walk on Instagram. An active member of the Madras Naturalists Society, he took people on a virtual tour of Perungudi Station Road, which was originally a marshland. “When it rains, dragonflies and damselflies start gathering around puddles and marshes, laying eggs, and patrolling around. Rains are good for moths, frogs and toads, and snakes as they break their dormancy and come out,” says Yuvan, who has recorded over 200 species of moths as part of a year-long study at Adyar Poonga. Teaching tourists Travellers generally have now become a little more appreciative of flora and fauna, says Praveen Muraleedharan, founder of Nectar Experience, a chain of eco-resorts in Kerala. “More people have started to show interest in specific herps,” says Praveen. The resorts at Marayoor, Nilambur, Munnar, Chinnar, Coorg, Wayanad, and Thattekkad have naturalists who guide visitors through the rich biodiversity of the region. Praveen’s project, Team Eco Ventures, offers photography tours too, which help those interested in macro photography to find their favourite herps and click them. The Windermere Estate at Munnar, and Riverhouse at Neriyamangalam have a naturalist, who takes visitors on herping tours and macro photography. Situated in a 60-acre coffee and cardamom plantation, the estate offers ample scope for herping. Though primarily in the leisure spot, Windermere is exploring possibilities in herping and birding as both properties are situated on the Western Ghats and are rich in biodiversity, says Dr. Simon John of Windermere. Conservationist H. Byju says such focussed tours eventually pave the way for conservation. “During the pandemic, people are setting out to watch small mammals too, like hedgehogs on the fringes of reserve forests in Satyamangalam and in places such as Ayalur near Madurai. There are exclusive tours to watch Slender lorises in Kallar near Mettupalayam. The experience makes them think about conservation.” As Yuvan says, watching creepy crawlies is a powerful way to connect with other life forms that live on plants, trees, in little pockets and cracks of cement... all sharing space with us.

03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||The man who built a forest||I take a 20-minute boat ride from the Baghmora camp site in Jorhat, Assam, followed by a 45-minute trek to meet ‘The Forest Man of India,’ Jadav Payeng. With me on the boat is Munmuni Payeng, Jadav’s daughter. As the boat approaches Molai forest in Majuli, Munmuni says, “This is where the forest begins. After we reach the shore, we trek through bushes and tall grass. Hope you are game.” I am. When we reach the shore, Munmuni warns me about stepping into soft mud on the low lands of the river bank and suggests I follow her. We make a path through the jungle, brushing aside branches and cobwebs with sticks. Though the walk is long, the spectacular view of trees, unpolluted sky, different kinds of birds at every 500 yards, and freshness in the air keep me going. Finally, we see a patch of land fenced with bamboo sticks. Munmuni points and says, “Deuta (Dad) is busy weeding the potato bed.”  Doing the impossible The 65-year-old Jadav Payeng was conferred the title ‘The Forest Man’ in Delhi by the Government of India on World Earth Day in 2010, for turning a barren land of 550 hectares (over 1,300 acres) into a lush green forest all by himself. It took close to 30 years for the land to turn into a forest and Jadav is protective about it. He started planting in 1979 and continues doing that even today. The locals call it Molai as a tribute to Jadav. He says, “As a child, I was fair and had pink cheeks just like the winter radish. So my pet name was Mola (radish in the local language). As I grew up and started planting trees, people started calling it Mola’r haabi (Mola’s forest). From there, someone conveniently made it Molai forest.” Jadav, however, refuses to take credit. “The birds, cows, deer, wind, water and elephants have helped me.” Dressed in a traditional handmade Mising gamusa and singlet, Jadav asks us to go ahead, so we wait in a neatly swept shed made of bamboo, clay and cow dung. A large wooden log from a fallen tree, resting on two sturdy stumps, serves as a bench. Seeing visitors, Jadav’s farm assistants light a small wood fire. His hands and feet are still covered in mud when Jadav joins us. “People want to know my story. I tell them I just plant trees, and I’d like all of you to do so. Trees are the lifeline of the forest. They don’t just give us shade and oxygen. They feed birds and animals and balance our eco system. If there is no life left, what is the use of all the advancements we have made?” Discussing why he started planting trees, Jadav adds how, as a child, he watched ships ferry goods to Kolkata and Dhaka. “Between 1965 and 1970 all of it was washed away by the Brahmaputra. An erosion of 10 kilometres happened and Mohgorh Khuti turned into a desert. I wanted a forest here, so I built a small boat and started planting saplings. People first thought I was crazy. But I didn’t give up on the saplings and came back every day to see their progress.” He continues, “My boat is as old as my forest. I still carry saplings in it every day.” Taking responsibility As a child, Jadav met Jadabesh Barua, an agricultural scientist, who used to give him saplings of paan leaves to be planted, and 25 paise. “In those days 25 paise bought close to 1.5 kilograms of groundnut and it made me happy. Barua one day took my hand and said ‘plant trees and they will take care of all of us’. So, when I saw my Majuli turning into a desert, I decided to do what I was asked to do by a scientist.” Ever since Jadav’s story went viral in 2010, he has travelled across the country, and the world, to give talks and attend conferences on climate change and environmental issues. “It will be a beautiful thing if a child is taught to plant a sapling or a seed when he is initiated in school and as he grows up, he or she is taught to take care of it and be responsible for it.” But wherever he goes, his heart beats for his home. “No matter where I go, I long to come back to my forest,” he says. “Everything abroad is beautiful, spic and span but there is no place like my forest. People spend money to see tigers, rhinos and elephants. I get to see them in their home, for free.” This also means adapting to the ways of the forest. “Once we were having lunch when a leopard dragged three buffaloes away. We don’t interfere when wild animals take our livestock,” he says, adding, “And when you encounter a herd of elephants, it is wise to hide. Only a fool would want to stand in front of an elephant.” Pointing to a tree laden with wild lemons, Jadav says, “This lemon tree is a favourite of the elephants. We make sure it is well watered and taken care of so they can eat to their hearts content.”  Taking a leaf Director Prabhu Solomon’s new film, poised to release mid-January 2021, has a central character inspired by Jadav Payeng. The trilingual film titled Kaadan in Tamil, Haathi Mere Saathi in Hindi and Aranya in Telugu, stars Rana Daggubati as a man who lives in the jungle. Is Jadav excited? He says, “If the movie makes people start loving trees, I will be delighted. I don’t mind if anyone makes monetary gains out of my story or through me. Only request I have is... do not gamble.” Despite the upcoming movie, and the fact that he is now in school text books, Jadav does not see himself as a celebrity, nor does he care about the laurels he has earned. “Reading about me is not enough. Do what I do. I want school teachers to follow up on my chapter with tree-planting sessions, and to teach children to nurture and grow them with love and care,” he says.   People want to know my story. I tell them I just plant trees, and I’d like all of you to do so.

03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||A digital debut for Sania||For Sania Mirza, 2019 was all about getting back in shape to make her comeback on the court. Following the birth of her son Izhaan in 2018, she was ready to take the tennis world by storm again in 2020. And if her hard-fought victory in January this year — at the WTA Hobart International doubles with Ukrainian player Nadiia Kichenok — was any indication, she would have succeeded, too. But the COVID-19 outbreak put all her plans on the backburner. However, the six-time Grand Slam winner has kept busy; this past week she debuted on television, joining the cast ofMTV Nishedh Alone Togetheras a radio host. The digital mini series revolves around the awareness and management of tuberculosis (TB) with a focus on the pandemic. “When I was approached for this project, I honestly did not know much about TB,” admits Sania, responding via e-mail from Dubai, UAE, where she is currently training. “I just knew a few people who have been through it and got cured because they got the right help at the right time,” she adds. She then researched a great deal about TB. “The stats were alarming. There are about 2.7 million cases in India annually, and at least five lakh are not even reported due to the lack of awareness about symptoms, besides myths and societal stigmas.” Given that COVID-19 also attacks the lungs, she points out that the pandemic further affects India’s TB control efforts. “The adversity of the virus and the subsequent restriction on movement has also affected people who are not able to seek the required help. The symptoms of TB and COVID-19 are similar. So, if someone has an induced cough and has tested negative for COVID-19, I urge them to not be ignorant and get tested for TB,” she says. The series will see her talking about the importance of maintaining relationships even when being physically apart from loved ones. Much of this year for Sania was spent away from her husband, Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik, as she and Izhaan stayed back at her home, in Hyderabad. “Yes, it was difficult to stay away from my husband for a long period of time. Initially, when the nationwide lockdown was imposed, there was a lot of uncertainty about how we will manage things, but I guess that happened to everybody. The best way was to be at home and ensure everyone’s safety, especially my toddler’s,” she says. The family reunited in Dubai in September, in time for both her and her son’s birthdays. Recently, she penned an open letter in support of Serena Williams and other mothers playing at the highest level of their respective sports. She describes how she lost 26 kg to come back to tennis “because that’s what I know, love and do.” Back on track Though Sania is unsure when her next tournament will be, her training is back on track. “I am high on fitness. But yes, I haven’t hit the court as much as I would have loved to, and undeniably, the regimen is not the same as when you train to hit the court.” Even as top tennis players, including Novak Djokovic contracted COVID-19 (in June), Sania had already made the decision not to play in the interest of her family. “Right now, I need to think as a parent and not just an athlete,” she says. Her two-year-old is now the centre of her universe. Thankful for the rare, quality time with her family, Sania has been spending most of her days recording playdates and workouts with her son in tow. She also created an Instagram account for him, which, incidentally, already has over 52,000 followers. “Since March, my child and I have spent every single day together and to watch him grow has been the most beautiful thing,” she says. MTV Nishedh Alone Together streams every Friday on the Facebook, YouTube and Instagram handles of MTV and MTV Nishedh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-digital-debut-for-sania/article33235788.ece
03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||He says, she saYS||When Filpkart Video approached Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia Deshmukh for Ladies Vs Gentlemen that seeks gender-based answers to a range of questions, they sensed an opportunity to voice their thoughts. Riteish, however, says that the show is not about what they think is right, but about what “India is thinking”. The format of the show is simple: each episode has three opinion-based questions. The panellists and viewers are given 15 seconds to answer following which their responses are revealed along with the collective opinion of the public, known as ‘India’s opinion’. When it came to hosting the show, Riteish says that there was not a question of tonality since the questions themselves would evoke a certain kind of reaction from viewers, who come from different walks of life. “Some of the questions were fun and some were thought-provoking. And there were taboo questions that were meant to be discussed. We [Genelia and I] represent a cross-section of India. Through the questions, we were able to gauge where India was tilting,” says Riteish over a Zoom call from Mumbai, along with his wife. Genelia chips in to add that Ladies Vs Gentlemen , launched on November 18 on the Flipkart app, does not offer solutions. It is more about exchanging perspectives. “Even with us, we share different viewpoints and that is always respected,” she adds. Being a couple has not changed or influenced their perspectives on gender, for, Genelia feels that they are not too gender-specific about their roles as parents. “For us, it is not a question of whether it is a man’s job or woman’s... it is more of who does it better. We give that space for each other,” she says, adding, “So, when Riteish sits down with kids to teach, I am not around because it is his time. We, as a couple, have evolved in what the kids have taught us.” Given that they are actors working in an industry that has become a breeding ground for gender stereotypes, would they discuss some of their personal experiences on the show? “Since most of us in the panel are in the film and entertainment industry, yes, it comes back to our experiences,” says Riteish. Genelia, however, gives a measured response: “I haven’t had too many experiences that were gender-biased.” That said, the larger goal, according to Riteish, was to open up certain subjects for viewers and make them feel okay to be discussed in reality. “There have been times where we haven’t given our opinions as a couple in public. What was more interesting was to hear feedback from people. We thought there was a clear distinction between the way men and women think. But we were mostly wrong.” The show made Genelia realise how much she misses work. Although she says she wouldn’t give up being a homemaker for anything, “There is also a part of me that is creatively interested in films. I didn’t want to be unfair to someone who signed me for a film. That is why I took the break. Now the kids are a little older... I have reached a stage where I am ready. Plus, there is so much that today’s cinema offers,” says Genelia, who made a comeback this year with It’s My Life , a Hindi remake of the Telugu comedy Bommarillu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/he-says-she-says/article33235908.ece
03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Upskilling, a life hack||“Being in their own environment helps neurodiverse people, including those with Autism and Down Syndrome, perform better. Remote working conditions are ideal for them, so, it makes sense that they do their learning remotely as well,” says Manu Sekar, the founder of HashHack Code. Over the past few months, this informal, Chennai-based outfit has been familiarising its special needs students with the basics of coding through online classes, uninterrupted by lockdown. Manu’s surmise is neither idle nor overambitious: he mentions proudly a former student who recently launched his own web services business. “We currently have 45 students from eight to 34 years old,” he says, adding that each student is taught individually through one-on-one online sessions, the format for which is deliberately kept open-ended. The key, he stresses, lies in understanding each individual’s pace of learning, “and letting them set the pace for us”. With the flow This is something HashHack Code has been doing even before they set out to teach people with special needs. “In 2016-17, we had begun by working with marginalised women — upskilling them, teaching them coding and finding them jobs,” says Manu, adding, “One of our clients back then had a daughter with autism, who was interested in learning code. A couple of other parents, too, wanted to see if we could help [teach their children].” From that first student, to three more, to 45 now, the team took their time taking new pupils. “We did not have any research on autism, or how to teach people with autism. We just tried to understand each person’s needs and went with that,” Manu states. So it is not a formal education programme, but it does teach the students enough to provide for some employment options. Since the setup is an informal one, HashHack Code operates not with “teachers”, but with “mentors”, a lot of whom are college students. An advantage of having student mentors, Manu says, is in the rapport that is struck between the one who learns and the one who teaches. “It is not a student-teacher relationship that we try to project. We prefer a peer-learning environment. Especially among our older students, being helped in their projects by someone closer to their age makes them feel comfortable and learn faster.” Projects are many, since HashHack code believes in experiential learning instead of lectures, and teaches its students by making them practically try things out. “This format translated more easily to online learning, when we made the switch during lockdown,” adds Manu. Manu is hopeful that this system helps the mentor. “Most of them are with us for about six to eight months, and will be joining official workplaces soon. I hope that having worked with neurodiverse people makes them more sensitive colleagues. The idea is for them to develop empathy and acceptance before joining the workforce.” Understanding different needs and helping people fit into the workforce, he points out, is an important trait, even if it isn’t a technical skill.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/upskilling-a-life-hack/article33235899.ece
03 December 2020||December 03 2020 00:00 IST,||Mariah Carey and Christmas: A match made in the North Pole||She is the undisputed queen of Christmas, and has been so — for 26 years and counting — ever since her fourth studio album Merry Christmas dropped in 1994, and ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You’ became one of the best-selling singles in history. The holiday song is etched deep in global folklore today — it is impossible to imagine December without it — and Carey continues calling it “her gift to the world”. This year, the singer-songwriter-actor is back with “another gift”, her Christmas special on Apple TV+. Titled Magical Christmas Special , the show features her and a starry line-up of her superstar friends: Tiffany Haddish, Billy Eichner, Ariana Grande, Jennifer Hudson, Snoop Dogg and Jermaine Dupri to mention a few. The special will drop on the streaming platform on December 4, and will release along with the soundtrack single and music video for ‘Oh Santa!,’ co-written by and featuring Carey with Ariana Grande and Jennifer Hudson. This comes just months after the singer’s memoir The Meaning of Mariah Carey debuted at #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list in September. Talking to us on a Zoom call from her home in the US, Carey looks as resplendent as ever. It is around 3 am in the morning where she lives, and she is diva personified, complete with a therapy dog nestling on her glittery dress as she begins the interview. Excerpts from a conversation: Would you say that your Magical Christmas Special is more anticipated than ever now because the world desperately needs a great holiday? It’s been my biggest dream to be able to share this with the world. The goal was to just do the most festive special possible. Thankfully, we were able to finish this while going through COVID as we conceptualised it earlier. While working on it, we did a lot of exploring in my vault, and there is another Christmas song in there too, which will be a surprise for sometime later. It has definitely been a nostalgic period for me. My memoir has taken me to a different place, as I went through that creative experience with my collaborator Michaela Angela Davis for over three years to finish it. It’s been fantastic seeing the response today, and now I’m waiting for a filmed version of it. I really hope the fans will enjoy my book and special for now. What was the working process like, collaborating with the likes of Ariana Grande?    Ariana Grande, J-Hud (Jennifer Hudson) and I were so excited about coming together for ‘Oh Santa’. The song required more of me as a producer to structure it for three voices. Snoop (Dogg) came on board at the last minute and surprised me with what he did. For me, personally, the greatest challenge right now is being open-minded and open to exploring all styles of music. All kinds of artistes reach out to me, and we have to get into that creative zone together. We can’t try too hard to make a hit; it has to happen organically. Mariah Carey and Christmas have gone hand-in-hand over the past two decades — what does the festival mean to you, especially in 2020?  Well, I absolutely enjoy the over-the-top aspect of it! But you have to love the spirit of the holiday first; only then you get to experience it fully and have it resonate with you. I know it will be different this year because of the pandemic. But I still look forward to sitting in bed, sipping on a hot chocolate and watching a Christmas movie surrounded by my close-knit family. I will miss being at shows, being around people of all ages, religions and races, kids with their parents. I’m already missing the hustle and bustle of the holiday season, the presents, et al. But like I say in my song, the lyrics literally go that I don't care about my presents under the tree. It’s not only about the grandeur, it’s about the spirit. Talking about ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You’, the anthem celebrated its 25th anniversary last year. What is your perception of the song today?  It’s been an interesting journey with it; the first Christmas song I ever wrote it. I’ve grown into falling in love with it more over the years. People really have connected with it in a way that I never expected. Finally, what would you like to tell all the women who look up to you as an icon in the industry today?  The goal of writing my book was to emancipate my inner child, it was for that little girl who felt shy, scared and alone. Don't think of yourself as second best. Always believe that it’s possible. It was never only about me wanting to be famous or rich; it was always about believing in myself. You wouldn’t even have heard of me if I’d given up early on! We are all a work-in-progress, but we just have to be as strong as possible and we will make it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/mariah-carey-and-christmas-a-match-made-in-the-north-pole/article33235897.ece
03 December 2020||NEW DELHI,||Green tribunal bans sale, use of crackers in NCR||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Wednesday ordered a complete ban on the sale and use of firecrackers during the COVID-19 pandemic in the National Capital Region (NCR), and all cities and towns where the ambient air quality is in the ‘poor’ or above categories. A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel also directed that only green crackers will be permitted for Christmas and New Year, between 11.55 p.m. and 12.30 a.m., in areas where the ambient air quality is in the ‘moderate’ or below categories. The NGT specified that the use of green crackers will be restricted to two hours for celebration of any “specified festival or permitted occasions”. The green panel also said at least one air quality monitoring station is required to be set up at every district headquarters. Noting that firecracker manufacturers have been opposing the ban, the NGT Bench observed: “Right to business is not absolute. There is no right to violate air quality and noise level norms. Nobody has the right to carry on business at the cost of the health of others. All licenses already given or which may be given are inherently subject to overriding requirement of preventing damage to the environment and the public health.” AQI to slightly improve The 24-hour average Air Quality Index of Delhi was 373 (very poor) on Wednesday, slightly up from 367 (very poor) on Tuesday. The values for Gurugram and Noida were 324 (very poor) and 394 (very poor), respectively. Delhi’s air quality is expected to improve on Thursday but will stay in the ‘very poor’ category, said SAFAR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/green-tribunal-bans-sale-use-of-crackers-in-ncr/article33235803.ece

It added that over 300 national and international firms, offering over500 job profiles across multiple sectors, have already registered for hiring students. The Office of Career Services (OCS), IIT-Delhi, said that many students have also bagged multiple placement offers and the top recruiters included Microsoft, Intel and Goldman Sachs. For domestic profiles “A few international recruiters have also registered. Further, given the current situation with travel restrictions in many countries, many companies are primarily recruiting for domestic profiles as of now. These may convert to international offers if the situation changes,” the premier institute said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/iit-d-students-bag-over-300-job-offers-on-day-1/article33235807.ece
03 December 2020||New Delhi,||New agriculture laws against interest of advocates: Bar Council of Delhi||The Bar Council of Delhi on Wednesday said that the controversial new farm laws were detrimental to the interest of legal professionals as it transfer the power to adjudicate any dispute between farmers and traders to the executive. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Council said that the “Bar of Civil Court jurisdiction” will substantially affect District Courts, as well as High Courts in some States. “The nature of subject matters covered under these laws are so vast that all disputes up till now entertained by Civil Courts will be adjudicated by SDMs/ADMs, who are not part of regular courts,” the Council said. ‘Will lead to corruption’ “SDMs/ADMs are always under the command of their bosses, which is antitheses to judicial independence and discipline. The rule of separation of powers cannot be compromised,” the Council argued, adding: “The mindset behind the move to oust jurisdiction of Civil Courts and transfer of power to bureaucrats, acting as executive officers, to decide disputes between traders and the farmers, will lead to corruption, and touts will victimise unimaginably.” The Bar Council of Delhi urged the Prime Minister to “withdraw legislations pertaining to farmers”.  “It seems the establishment is averse to courts and wants justice delivery system under their thumb,” the Council said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/new-agriculture-laws-against-interest-of-advocates-bar-council-of-delhi/article33235805.ece
03 December 2020||New Delhi,||Ramani pleads truth as her defence before court||Journalist Priya Ramani on Wednesday pleaded truth as her defence before a Delhi court in response to a criminal defamation suit filed by former Union Minister M.J. Akbar for her tweets accusing him of sexual harassment. Ms. Ramani said that her tweet and subsequent article on Vogue magazine alleging Mr. Akbar of sexual harassment during his previous role as newspaper editor was made in “good faith” and for public good.The reason for the tweet and the article, Ms. Ramani said, was because “it touched a question of public importance”. Senior advocate Rebecca John appearing for Ms. Ramani argued that the court will have to come to a conclusion that although an imputation was made, no case for defamation is made out. Ms. John highlighted exceptions in section 499 of the IPC on defamation, which says that it is not defamation to impute anything which is true concerning any person, if it be for the public good that the imputation should be made or published. Whether or not the imputation is for the public good is a question of fact that the court has to decide, Ms. John argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ramani-pleads-truth-as-her-defence-before-court/article33235801.ece
03 December 2020||New Delhi,||Ex-DDA employees held for duping man of Rs. 1.9 cr.||Two men were arrested for allegedly duping a man of Rs. 1.9 crore by using forged documents on the pretext of allotting a Delhi Development Authority (DDA) plot in east Delhi. The accused, Prem Shankar Sharma (68) and Rana Pratap Chauhan (72), were former employees of the DDA. They are involved in more than 13 such cases, police said on Wednesday. Police said a probe was initiated on a complaint by one Ashish Sharma, who alleged that the duo took Rs. 1.90crore from him for allotment of a DDA plot in Krishna Nagar. According to the complainant, after showing the plot, the accused told him that the purchase price of the plot is only Rs. 22 lakh, but he had to spend about Rs. 2 crore extra. As the market price of the plot was much higher, he agreed to pay the amount. They took Rs. 1.9 crore from him and gave a fake allotment letter. When he found about it, he demanded his money back. They gave him four cheques worth Rs. 80 lakh, which got dishonoured.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ex-dda-employees-held-for-duping-man-of-rs-19-cr/article33235808.ece
