17 July 2020||JAIPUR,||Rebel Rajasthan MLAs move HC against Speaker’s notices||Amid the worsening political crisis in Rajasthan, rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident MLAs moved the High Court on Thursday challenging the disqualification notices issued to them by the Assembly Speaker. The Pilot camp contended that they could not be disqualified merely for disagreeing with the decisions and policies of some leaders outside the Assembly. Speaker C.P. Joshi issued the notices on Wednesday on a plea filed by Congress Chief Whip Mahesh Joshi citing the MLAs’ absence from successive Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meetings and a “conspiracy to bring down the government”. The 19 MLAs, including Mr. Pilot and former Ministers Vishvendra Singh and Ramesh Meena, were given time till Friday afternoon to respond. In their writ petition, the legislators sought quashing of the notices, arguing that they had neither given up their membership of the House nor did their failure to attend the two CLP meetings render them liable for disqualification on the ground of defection. The matter was listed for hearing before a Division Bench of the High Court, headed by Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty, on Friday after the petition first came up before a Single Bench on Thursday. The court referred the case to the Division Bench when petitioners’ counsel Harish Salve, appearing through video conferencing, said they wanted to challenge the constitutional validity of some provisions as well. Accordingly, the writ petition was amended and filed again to challenge the Speaker’s notices as well as the validity of the Rajasthan Assembly Members (Disqualification on the Grounds of Changing Party) Rules, 1989, and Clause 2(1)(a) of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, dealing with disqualification on the ground of defection. Mr. Joshi, who filed the application before the Speaker, also approached the court to be impleaded as a party and be heard before any order is passed. If the rebel MLAs are disqualified, the majority mark in the 200-member Assembly will decline, making it easier for Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot to win a floor test. Mr. Pilot, sacked as Deputy Chief Minister following his rebellion, and other MLAs accused the Speaker of acting under the influence of Mr. Gehlot. They said he had issued the impugned notices with “mala fide intentions”. Mr. Gehlot, they said, had ordered an inquiry by the Special Operations Group (SOG) to threaten Mr. Pilot and his supporters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rebel-rajasthan-mlas-move-hc-against-speakers-notices/article32108097.ece
17 July 2020||Chennai,||Virus cases cross 1 million mark, deaths exceed 25,600||The total confirmed COVID-19 positive cases in India crossed the one million mark, 175 days after the first case was registered on January 30 in Kerala. India now has the third highest number of confirmed cases, behind the U.S.’s close to 3.5 million and Brazil’s 1.97 million cases. On Thursday, 34,424 infections were registered, along with 676 deaths, to take the overall death toll to 25,619, the eighth highest in the world. Data from Assam and Tripura were not yet in at the time of this report going to print. Galloping cases Maharashtra registered yet another new high in total cases — 8,641 and 266 deaths, followed by Tamil Nadu’s 4,549 cases and 69 deaths. Karnataka registered its highest-ever spike — 4,169 cases and 104 deaths with overall cases reaching 51,422, the fourth highest in the country. Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh also registered daily highs — 2,593 and 2,058 cases, along with 40 and 34 deaths, respectively. While Andhra Pradesh is among States with the highest test rates (22,812 tests among a million people), U.P. remains among those with low test rates (5,473 per million). Cases were also doubling every 21 days in India, the fastest such rate among countries with the highest case load in the world. Despite the recovery rate being nearly 63.4%, India’s cumulative test positivity rate has now reached nearly 8% and is rising steadily, indicating that higher testing will continue to reveal more infections. India’s seven day rolling average of deaths (568 per day) remains high compared to most countries, lower only than Brazil (1,057 per day), the U.S. (695), Mexico (587). India’s overall population is higher than these countries, leading to a lower death rate adjusted to population, but India also has a relatively younger population.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/virus-cases-cross-1-million-mark-deaths-exceed-25600/article32108100.ece

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressed concern over the State’s recovery rate dropping to 59.29%. “A few days ago, the recovery rate was over 66%. The recovery rate has now dipped because more people are getting admitted to hospitals,” Ms. Banerjee said. The Chief Minister requested the people of the State to support the government in its battle against COVID-19. She said the State government was neither god nor does it have a magic wand. “This is not a battle of the Health Department or the police alone. Everyone has to contribute to the fight against the virus,” she said. The Chief Minister also expressed her displeasure over people protesting over alleged poor facilities in quarantine centres. She also said government authorities are facing opposition from residents when a quarantine centre is being set up in a locality or a crematorium is used for the final rites of a COVID-19 victim. Ms. Banerjee said if people continued to protest, “there will be no safe houses in your locality, no quarantine centres”. She said, “Crematorium are not being allowed to open for the final rites of COVID-19 victims. But what happens when you suffer from the infection?” Ms. Banerjee also said that the Central government was not providing the State with adequate infrastructure to deal with the pandemic. “We thought will get 10,000 ventilators, oxygen beds and free drugs. But we got nothing,” she said.  This is not a battle of the Health Department or the police alone.

17 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||DMC report casts doubt on police role during February violence||A fact-finding committee constituted by the Delhi Minorities Commission to look into the February riots in north-east Delhi has claimed that the violence followed an “organised and systematic pattern” and did not have the spontaneity of a riot. The findings of the 10-member committee suggest that the failure to prevent violence by Delhi police “was not due to individual or sporadic breaches, but was a pattern of deliberate inaction over several days”. The report claims that efforts have been made to change the narrative “to one of violence on both sides rather than a pogrom that was in fact carried out”. The report says the entire chain of events is missing from most of the chargesheets that have been filed and that the police are investigating almost all the cases based on the premise that the riots were planned by anti-CAA protesters to coincide with the U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India.  Speech effect The findings of the committee headed by M.R. Shamshad, Advocate-on-Record, Supreme Court, says that the violence that occurred between February 23 and 26 started in different pockets in the area almost immediately after a speech by BJP leader Kapil Mishra at Maujpur in the presence of DCP (North East district) Ved Prakash Surya. “Following the speech, different groups/mobs quickly fanned out to the local areas, openly carrying various weapons and actions were not taken by the district administration or the police to protect life and property,” the report says. It adds that testimonies reveal that the attacks were targeted towards the Muslim population and barring one incident, there have not been reports of Muslims being armed with weapons other than stones. Reacting to the report, Delhi Police Additional PRO Anil Mittal said each and every report was registered and investigated professionally, leading to the registration of 752 FIRs. Over 400 of the 752 cases were registered on complaints lodged by the members of the minority community, he said. “We will study this report and if there are any corrective measures that need to be taken, we will absolutely do that,” a Delhi government spokesperson said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dmc-report-casts-doubt-on-police-role-during-february-violence/article32108290.ece
17 July 2020||San Francisco,||Twitter hack targets high-profile users||Twitter is investigating a massive hack in which high- profile users from Elon Musk to Joe Biden had their accounts hijacked by scammers. Posts trying to dupe people into sending hackers the virtual currency Bitcoin were tweeted by the official accounts of Apple, Uber, Kanye West, Bill Gates, Barack Obama and many others on Wednesday. “We detected what we believe to be a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools,” Twitter said. The posts said people had 30 minutes to send $1,000 in the cryptocurrency, promising double returns. A total of 12.58 bitcoins — worth almost $116,000 — were sent to e-mail addresses mentioned in the tweets, according to the site Blockchain.com, which monitors crypto transactions. “Tough day for us at Twitter,” chief executive Jack Dorsey said in a tweet. “We all feel terrible this happened. We’re diagnosing and will share everything we can when we have a more complete understanding of exactly what happened.” Twitter said it had locked down the affected accounts and removed the tweets posted by the hackers. “Most accounts should be able to Tweet again,” the Twitter support team said in an evening update, having earlier temporarily disabled all posts from verified accounts with an official blue checkmark. But the company told users that it “may take further actions and will update you if we do”.U.S. President Donald Trump’s account, which has more than 83 million followers, was not among those targeted, but many specialist Bitcoin firms were.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/twitter-hack-targets-high-profile-users/article32108139.ece
17 July 2020||CHENNAI,||92.3% pass as girls outperform boys again in Plus Two exams||Tamil Nadu recorded a pass percentage of 92.3% in the Plus-Two board exams, the results of which were declared on Thursday morning. The Directorate of Government Examinations took students and teachers by surprise with the sudden declaration of the results since the last exam for absentees is scheduled for July 27. As many as 7.79 lakh students had taken up the exams in March. The pass percentage saw a marginal increase, compared with the 91.30% recorded last year. There was, however, a decrease in the number of candidates who took up the exams this year, compared with 2019. The students this year were the first to take up the exams under the revised syllabus. Tiruppur, with a pass percentage of 97.12%, Erode, 96.99%, and Coimbatore, 96.39%, took the top spots among the districts. 94.80% of the girls who wrote the exams got through, 5.39% higher than the boys. As has been the practice for the last few years, the School Education Department refrained from releasing the list of toppers. Vishnucharan Panneerselvam, Correspondent, Shree Niketan Group of Schools, said that while the overall results were good, the marks in physics and chemistry dipped this year. “Over the last few years, we’re noticing that the CBSE board marks seem to be higher than the State board marks, especially for students in the science group. This is a reversal of how it used to be earlier...,” he said. Apart from the new syllabus, there was no blueprint this year for the students, and the School Education Department had stressed that students and teachers should treat all lessons with equal importance. “Around 70% of our students have scored 400-500 marks, and the number of students who have got above 500 marks has come down,” said G.J. Manohar, Senior Principal, MCC Higher Secondary School. Plus-Two students who had to take up their Plus-One arrear exams in March this year got those results, too. The Directorate of Government Examinations has said that for candidates who were absent and who would write the final Plus-Two paper on July 27, the results for all subjects would be announced at a later date.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/923-pass-as-girls-outperform-boys-again-in-plus-two-exams/article32108201.ece
17 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||Pakistan did not allow free consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav: India||India on Thursday accused Pakistan of not allowing free and unimpeded consular access to death row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav. India had demanded that access should be without interference from Pakistani security officials but official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said the circumstances of the meeting did not allow them to get Mr. Jadhav’s consent for legal representation. The consent is necessary for filing a review plea against the death sentence. “The consular officers were not given unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional access to Shri Jadhav. On the contrary, Pakistani officials, with an intimidating demeanour, were present in close proximity of Shri Jadhav and consular officers despite the protests of the Indian side. It was also evident from a camera that was visible that the conversation with Shri Jadhav was being recorded,” said the spokesperson. The Indian official said Mr. Jadhav was “visibly under stress and indicated that clearly to the consular officers”. “The arrangements did not permit a free conversationThe Consular Officers could not engage Shri Jadhav on his legal rights and were prevented from obtaining his written consent for arranging his legal representation,” said Mr. Srivastava. Earlier reports had suggested that Pakistan was willing to consider a review petition through a legal representative to appeal against the death sentence given to Mr. Jadhav by a military tribunal but the absence of written consent makes the prospect of a legal representative impossible. In view of the difficulties in the meeting, the two diplomats, Charge d’Affaires Gaurav Ahluwalia and First Secretary Cherakung Zeliang left the meeting after protesting against the intimidation from the Pakistani side. Pakistan has claimed the second consular access to Mr. Jadhav went as planned. The first consular access was provided on September 2, 2019 during which India had complained about Pakistani interference. “Two consular officers of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad were provided unimpeded and uninterrupted consular access to Commander Jadhav at 3 p.m.,” claimed a press release issued from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan. Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in a TV interview however claimed that India is not serious about the process. Pakistan claims that Mr. Jadhav was involved in fomenting violence in its territory. India maintains that he is a former navy official who had retired from service and was conducting personal business in the Iranian port of Chabahar when he was abducted by Pakistan. India had taken the case to the International Court of Justice which had ordered Pakistan to grant consular access to him. Pakistan said on Thursday that it remains committed to implementing the July 17, 2019 ICJ judgment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pakistan-did-not-allow-free-consular-access-to-kulbhushan-jadhav-india/article32108099.ece

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that these deaths would be studied by the experts’ team. The State would also go into the after-effects of COVID-19 in many recovered patients. Andhra Pradesh reported over 2,000 fresh cases and 40 deaths in a single day taking the tally to 38,044 and death toll to 492. On Thursday morning, the State recorded 40 COVID-19 deaths and 2,593 fresh cases, another single-day peak.

17 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||Disengagement process intricate: Army||The disengagement process on the border to resolve the tensions is “intricate and requires constant verification”, and both India and China remained committed to the objective of complete disengagement, the Army said on Thursday. The External Affairs Ministry said both sides had agreed “at specific points to redeploy towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the Line of Actual Control [LAC]”, which it said were mutually agreed reciprocal actions to be taken by both sides and there was absolutely “no change” with respect to India’s position on the LAC. “The Senior Commanders reviewed the progress of the implementation of the first phase of disengagement and discussed further steps to ensure complete disengagement,” the Army said in a statement on the Tuesday talks at the Corps Commander level. The engagement was consistent with the consensus reached between the Special Representatives of India and China on July 5 to discuss complete disengagement, it stated. Tuesday’s fourth round of commander-level talks at Chushul went on for 15 hours, during which the two sides worked out details of the next phase of disengagement as well as a complete withdrawal of forces along the LAC. “The disengagement process currently under way in the western sector is specifically aimed at addressing face-off situations and close-up deployments of troops along the LAC. It is based on an understanding between senior military commanders,” Anurag Srivastava, MEA official spokesperson, said at the weekly press briefing. ‘Ongoing process’ Mr. Srivastava called the disengagement an “ongoing process”.. “We are fully committed to observing and respecting the LAC. Any unilateral attempts to change the status quo along the LAC are not acceptable,” he noted. The high-powered China Study Group, headed by the National Security Adviser, on Wednesday deliberated on the previous day talks. India and China have been engaged in discussions through established military and diplomatic channels to address the prevailing situation along the LAC since the stand-off began in early May. An Army source described the Tuesday talks as “positive”. More rounds of talks would be held, a source said. Resolution of Pangong Tso was likely to take some time, the source added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/disengagement-process-intricate-army/article32108062.ece
17 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||Centre sets much store by vaccine trial||A COVID-19 vaccine candidate, ZyCoV-D, designed and developed by Zyuds Cadila with the support of the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), will begin adaptive phase 1 and 2 clinical trials to assess its safety, tolerability and immunogenicity, the Union Health Ministry said on Thursday. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said in a tweet: “This is an important milestone for Atmanirbhar Bharat. I hope that the vaccine continues to show positive outcomes as it has done so far in the pre-clinical phase where it was found to be safe, immunogenic and well-tolerated.” Renu Swarup, Secretary, DBT, said the tie-up with Zydus was to address rapid development of an indigenous vaccine for COVID-19 under the National Biopharma Mission. “We hope that the vaccine continues to show positive outcomes as it has done so far in the pre-clinical phase, where it was found to be safe, immunogenic and well tolerated. This will be a big leap forward for Indian scientific research,” she said. “In pre-clinical phase, ZyCoV-D was found to elicit a strong immune response in multiple animal species like mice, rats, guinea pigs and rabbits. The antibodies produced by the vaccine were able to neutralise the wild type virus in virus neutralization assay, indicating the protective potential of the vaccine candidate. No safety concerns were observed for the vaccine candidate in repeat dose toxicology studies by both intramuscular and intradermal routes of administration. In rabbits, up to three times, the intended human dose was found to be safe, well tolerated and immunogenic,” the DBT said. Pankaj R. Patel, chairman of Zydus Cadila, stated that this was an important step in the fight against the pandemic and one that would help the nation combat this healthcare challenge. Recovery rate The Health Ministry, highlighting a growing recovery rate, said that from mid-June, after crossing the 50% mark, there had been a steady increase in the number, and a decline in the number of active cases. It pointed out that 63.25% of the patients had recovered so far. “Less than 2% of the affected patients are admitted in ICUs. Gradually we are moving in the direction to win the battle against the pandemic. Our lab network has been strengthened; we have had an exponential growth in the number of labs which have grown from one in January 2020 to 1,234 currently,” Dr. Vardhan said. The Ministry said targeted measures have contributed to a steady decline in the number of active cases. As on date, the actual caseload in the country was only 3,31,146 and these contributed to a little more than a third (34.18%) of the total cases detected so far. The actual caseload had remained limited and manageable due to proactive containment measures, including house-to-house survey, perimeter control activities, timely contact tracing and surveillance of containment zones.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-sets-much-store-by-vaccine-trial/article32108070.ece
17 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||France to resume limited flights||India is inching towards opening international air travel and will soon allow airlines from France and Germany to operate a limited number of flights to the country. A bilateral agreement with France has already been finalised, which allows Air France to operate 28 flights, and a deal with Germany for Lufthansa is at an advanced stage of discussions, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri said on Thursday. Air France will operate 28 flights from July 18 to August 1 between Paris and Delhi and Mumbai and Bengaluru. France is the third country to get a nod after the U.S. and the UAE were given permission to start flights to India earlier this month. U.S. carrier United Airways will operate 18 flights from Thursday until July 31. All these countries had threatened to put India’s Vande Bharat mission for repatriation of Indians in jeopardy by imposing restrictions on Air India. “We will see how the operations are conducted, and then we will review the arrangement and how much extension (can be given) and demand there is,” Mr. Puri told presspersons. The government had earlier spoken about establishing “travel bubbles” with different countries, which according to global airline’s body IATA should entail relaxing quarantine norms considerably between two countries with similar experiences, vis-a-vis COVID-19 cases.  Quarantine rules stay But the deals being finalised by India do not include any exemptions on isolation. IATA has argued that imposing quarantine rules amounts to a full travel ban and has economic costs for countries. Private Indian carriers could also be given a share of the flights agreed upon in bilateral arrangements with different countries. “We are happy to allow other airlines to also participate in bilateral arrangements, in case domestic carriers want to acquire wide-bodied planes,” Mr. Puri said. He was referring to Vistara’s plans to launch long-haul international flights to destinations such as London. The Tata-Singapore Airlines joint venture has one Boeing 787 and plans to add three more by the end of this fiscal, which makes it the only private airline with the capability to operate non-stop flights to faraway countries after the closure of Jet Airways last year. Rajiv Bansal, Chairman and Managing Director, Air India, said New Delhi-U.S. airfares under the Vande Bharat mission that were earlier priced at nearly Rs. 1,00,000 had been reduced by 25% and would be brought down further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/france-to-resume-limited-flights/article32108089.ece
17 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||India registers a steep decline in maternal mortality ratio||The Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) in India has declined to 113 in 2016-18 from 122 in 2015-17 and 130 in 2014-2016, according to the special bulletin on Maternal Mortality in India 2016-18, released by the Office of the Registrar General’s Sample Registration System (SRS). One of the key indicators of maternal mortality is the MMR, defined as the number of maternal deaths per 1,00,000 live births. The target 3.1 of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) set by the United Nations aims to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 1,00,000 live births. The MMR of various States according to the bulletin includes Assam (215), Bihar (149), Madhya Pradesh (173), Chhattisgarh (159), Odisha (150), Rajasthan (164), Uttar Pradesh (197) and Uttarakhand (99). The southern States registered a lower maternal mortality ratio — Andhra Pradesh (65), Telangana (63), Karnataka (92), Kerala (43) and Tamil Nadu (60). “Maternal mortality in a region is a measure of reproductive health of women in the area. As per the World Health Organization, maternal death is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management,” noted the bulletin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-registers-a-steep-decline-in-maternal-mortality-ratio/article32108351.ece
17 July 2020||KOCHI,||An island that has kept coronavirus at bay||The Lakshadweep archipelago, with a total land area of 32 sq km and home to about 70,000 people, has not reported a single COVID-19 case so far though cases are rising in other parts of the country. Its nearest neighbour Kerala, about 400 km away, with which the islanders are constantly in touch for supplies, education and health care, has around 9,000 confirmed cases as on Wednesday. “The sea has saved us,” said Mohamed Faizal, Lakshadweep MP, on Thursday. Since the lockdown came into effect on March 23, no one had been allowed to reach the islands without a seven-day quarantine followed by a COVID-19 test, all at the expense of the island administration, he said. Salih Komalam, COVID-19 nodal officer, and his team have kept vigil and continue to be on their toes. The achievement is not a miracle but the result of great patience and meticulous attention to details. “We are fortunate that people can reach the islands only by sea,” said Dr. Salih Komalam. The only airport, at Agatti, serving the group of 10 inhabited islands, was shut down in March. The island administration stopped issuing passes to visitors. The island is accessible to visitors, both from India and abroad, only if they possess passes issued by the island administration. The only way was to stop the inflow from outside after the pandemic broke out. At the same time, “we cannot cut off our connection with Kerala,” said Mr. Faizal. People continue to be evacuated for medical treatment, but anyone returning to the islands or wanting to visit the island undergo quarantine in Kochi. Those from outside India have to undergo a 14-day quarantine.  Now, there are around 200 persons in quarantine at three facilities operated by the island administration in Kochi. They can travel to the islands after their quarantine, if the COVID-19 test returns negative. It was a great relief, said an islander, who is in quarantine in Kochi, about the condition in the island. He is about to return to the island to join duty after the quarantine period. At the same time, the rise in COVID-19 numbers in Ernakulam was a cause for great worry for the islanders, said a resident of the island. People had been advised to wear masks and practise physical distancing. The administration did not want to take a chance, said Mr. Faizal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/an-island-that-has-kept-coronavirus-at-bay/article32108411.ece
17 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC to examine Kerala Act on animal, bird sacrifices||The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to examine the constitutional validity of the Kerala Animals and Bird Sacrifices Prohibition Act of 1968 that prohibits sacrifice of animals and birds in temples to ‘please’ the deity. Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde, heading a three-judge Bench, highlighted the “dichotomy” in animal protection law that allows killing of animals for food but does not permit “killing of animals for offer to a deity and then consumption”. Similarly, the CJI said how the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960 allows killing of animals but prohibits cruelty to animals. “So, killing is not cruelty?” he asked. The oral remarks came in an appeal filed by P.E. Gopalakrishnan and some others, who are Shakthi worshippers, and for whom, animal sacrifice is an integral part of the worship. In their appeal, filed through advocate A. Karthik and A.Parameshwar, they said animal sacrifice was an “essential religious practice” and the High Court had no power to interfere. “The Act criminalises the intent behind the animal sacrifice, and not animal sacrifice per se. If the sacrifice is not for propitiating any deity but for personal consumption even in the precincts of temple, it is not forbidden. This arbitrary classification is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution”, the appeal said. It argued that Section 28 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 1960 does not make killing of animals for religious purposes an offence. However the 1968 State law bans killing of animals and birds for religious sacrifices but not for personal consumption.  Arbitrary classification This amounted to arbitrary classification. The appellants said if killing of animals and birds was to be prohibited, let it be so for all purposes — religious or otherwise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-to-examine-kerala-act-on-animal-bird-sacrifices/article32108028.ece
17 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||No postal ballot facility for voters above 65: EC||The Election Commission on Thursday said the postal ballot facility for electors above the age of 65 in the Bihar Assembly elections, which would have been the first time it would have been used since the Centre had notified it on June 19, would not be implemented. In a statement, the EC said the decision was taken for the Assembly elections and bypolls due soon due to logistical challenges. It had instructed Bihar authorities to limit the number of electors to 1,000 per polling station due to the pandemic, for which 34,000 additional stations are being set up.  The EC said the additional polling stations “would entail formidable logistical challenges of mobilising 1.8 lakh more polling personnel and other additional resources including requirement of much larger number of vehicles in Bihar. Similar challenges would be there for the coming by-elections.”  The poll body said the option of postal ballots would be available to electors over 80 years of age, persons with disabilities, essential service workers and those infected with COVID-19 or suspected to be. After the Law Ministry notified the extension of postal ballots to electors over 65, several political parties had raised concerns over the decision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-postal-ballot-facility-for-voters-above-65-ec/article32108050.ece
17 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||Iran had gone silent on rail project: India||The Government of India says it had not received any response from Iran since December 2019 on the future of the Chabahar-Zahedan railway project that the state-owned railway construction company IRCON was to have constructed and financed. The ONGC’s foreign arm OVL is also out of the Farzad-B gas field exploration project. The government cited policy changes by the Iranian government, Iran’s precarious finances, and the U.S. sanctions situation as the reasons for the decisions on Indian infrastructure projects in Iran, which would both be undertaken through local companies instead. Last week, Iranian Railways and its transport department inaugurated laying of track for the 628-km stretch from the southern port city of Chabahar to Zahedan on the border with Afghanistan. Officials had told The Hindu that the track would now be funded by Iran’s own National Development fund. According to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), IRCON had completed its site inspection and review of the feasibility report for the project last year under an MoU signed between India and Iran during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit in 2016. “Detailed discussions were thereafter held on other relevant aspects of the project, which had to take into account the financial challenges that Iran was facing,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava responding to questions on various infrastructure projects in Iran, including the report by The Hindu on the railway line. “In December 2019, issues [on the railway line] were reviewed in detail at the 19th India-Iran Joint Commission Meeting in Tehran. The Iranian side was to nominate an authorized entity to finalize outstanding technical and financial issues. This is still awaited,” Mr. Srivastava stated but declined to comment specifically on Iran’s decision to begin the project without India. On Wednesday, Farhad Montaser, an official in Iran’s Ports and Maritime Organization, said India’s MoU for the rail line had never fructified in an agreement. “We had a list of Indian investments in Chabahar port, which also included the issue of Chabahar railway infrastructure and the railway but during the negotiations, it was not agreed [upon],” he told official news agency IRNA. The MEA also confirmed that India is no longer involved in the Farzad-B gas field project where ONGC had originally signed an agreement for exploration in 2002, investing approximately $100 million thus far. The MEA said “policy changes” in Iran were responsible for the decision but didn’t give details. “In January 2020, we were informed that in the immediate future, Iran would develop the field on its own and would like to involve India appropriately at a later stage. This matter remains under discussion,” Mr. Srivastava said. India had proposed to invest $1.6 billion in the Chabahar-Zahedan railway line, and approximately $6 billion in the Farzad-B gas field project. Chabahar Port project The MEA said India’s main investment in the Chabahar Port where it has taken over operations of one terminal, had progressed well in the last few years, handling 82 ships with 12 lakh tonnes of bulk cargo in 8200 containers since December 2018. “Despite the difficulties posed by the [U.S.] sanctions situation, there has been significant progress on the port project. Proactive measures are currently under way to increase the usage of Chabahar Port, both for Afghanistan and Central Asia,” Mr. Srivastava said at the briefing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/iran-had-gone-silent-on-rail-project-india/article32108080.ece
17 July 2020||Patna,||Bihar govt. denies bridge was washed away||The Bihar government on Thursday denied media reports that a bridge inaugurated by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar a month ago across Gandak river in Gopalganj district was washed away on Wednesday in floods. It said “only an approach road of a minor bridge was damaged”. “The Sattarghat bridge has not been damaged, as nearly 2 km from it, an approach road of an 18 m-long minor bridge was cut due to surging swollen waters in the Gandak… This has happened because of unprecedented pressure of water in the river… However, the structure of the minor bridge has not been affected. The main Sattarghat bridge is totally intact,” a press release said. “There is no issue of any misappropriation in this project… This is a natural disaster.” State Road Construction Department Minister Nand Kishore Yadav said, “The RJD leaders do not have any moral right to say anything on the issue of corruption…the bridge is intact and only an approach road of a minor bridge in the area was damaged, which too will be repaired as soon as the water recedes.” Earlier, reports said the 1.4-km-long Sattarghat bridge inaugurated by Mr. Kumar on June 16 through video conferencing was washed away in floodwaters just 29 days after inauguration. The foundation stone for the Rs. 263.47-crore bridge was laid by Mr. Kumar on April 5, 2012. The bridge connects Gopalganj district with Saran and East Champaran districts, reducing the distance between Motihari and Chhapra by 45 km. The swollen floodwater in the Gandak washed away the northern side of the newly inaugurated bridge and disrupted traffic movement causing great inconvenience to the commuters, said local reports and people of Gopalganj. Many rivers in Bihar, especially in the northern parts of the State, are currently swollen and flowing above the danger mark, giving rise to the threat of flood in those areas. Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Tejashwi Yadav earlier referred to “loot and corruption” in the NDA government and tweeted, “The bridge constructed in eight years after spending Rs. 263 crore collapsed in just 29 days…the godfather of organized corruption Nitish Kumarji will not speak even a word on this.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bihar-govt-denies-bridge-was-washed-away/article32108094.ece
17 July 2020||GUWAHATI,||‘Plasma donors in Assam may get preference in jobs’||Plasma donors in Assam may get preference in jobs and government schemes as a gesture for helping fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Donating plasma can also entail extra marks in interviews besides acknowledgement, Assam Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Thursday. “The plasma donors will get a certificate. We will consider giving preference to them in interviews, government schemes, etc. For instance, a plasma donor will get two extra marks if he or she is tied in any test or interview,” he said. “Similarly, the name of someone at the bottom of the beneficiary list for PMAY [Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana] will be put on top if that person is a plasma donor,” the Minister said, appealing to people who recovered from COVID-19 to donate plasma. No negative impact Dr. Sarma underscored observations in India and the U.S. that plasma therapy had no negative impact and 90% of patients recovered if plasma was donated to a patient in a moderate state of illness. He said plasma from one person could save two lives and only those who had COVID-19 symptoms and were in intensive treatment could donate. The Minister said Assam was on its way to setting up a plasma bank. People of other States who donate plasma would be provided with State guest house facilities if they visit Assam and the State government would bear the cost of their return air ticket. Till July 15, Assam had 19,754 positive cases of whom 12,888 have recovered and 48 died. The death rate is 0.24% while the recovery rate is 65.24%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/plasma-donors-in-assam-may-get-preference-in-jobs/article32108074.ece

17 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||Varsities undecided on final year exams||Fewer than half of the country’s universities say they are prepared to conduct final year examinations as directed by the University Grants Commission (UGC). The rest are undecided or yet to inform the UGC of their decision, 10 days after the guidelines were issued, according to data from the regulator. “Universities were approached to inform the status of the conduct of examination,” the UGC said in a statement on Thursday. Out of 993 universities, 182 have informed the UGC that they have already conducted the examination, while another 272 plan to do so. Another 177 universities have informed the regulator that they are yet to decide on the conduct of the examination. There are no final year students in 27 private universities which were only established last year. The remaining universities are yet to respond. At least five non-BJP State governments have announced that their universities will not conduct examinations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in defiance of the guidelines. Only 251 out of 412 State universities have responded so far. ‘Guidelines still stand’ “After issuing the guidelines, we are now understanding the readiness and status of implementation for examinations to be conducted by the end of September. The guidelines still stand,” UGC member secretary Rajnish Jain told The Hindu when asked why this kind of feedback had not been sought from universities before the guidelines were issued. Several State governments and universities have said they were not consulted before the decision was taken.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/varsities-undecided-on-final-year-exams/article32108077.ece

He was wanted in more than a dozen cases of murder and dacoity, including the recent Ankur Bharadwaj murder. Carrying a reward of Rs. 50,000 on his head, he was said to be a member of the Yogesh Bhadauda gang, whose leader is lodged in Siddharthnagar jail. Jitendra Sargam, Circle Officer, Sardhana, who led the encounter team, said he was informed by the SHO, Rohta that two gangsters were looting passengers on the Suroorpur-Lohargarh route. “When we challenged them, they opened fired at us, injuring sub-inspector Anuj Malik.

17 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||Universities grapple with changing admissions process||At St. John’s College in Agra, COVID-19 has forced a 170-year old institution to change its admissions process. Instead of its usual entrance examination, the college will depend on school Board examination marks to assess applicants this year. “It is not safe to conduct a physical entrance exam at this time. Municipal authorities will not give permission, and students from other areas will not be able to travel to Agra. We don’t have the facilities or software to conduct an online examination with remote proctoring,” said Shailendra Singh, Principal of the college, which is affiliated to the Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar University but conducts its own admissions. However, many Class 12 Board examinations were also disrupted this year, raising doubts about the validity of those marks. “It’s a major concern for us, but there is an air of resignation, as there is no other option. We are caught between the devil and the deep sea,” he said. His dilemma is shared by colleges and universities across the country, grappling with how to conduct admissions for the next academic year as the pandemic continues to spread. Many school Boards — including the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) — declared Class 12 results this week and these students are now anxious to begin the process of college admissions. “We cannot do admissions without entrance tests. There are thousands of students who have all scored above 90% or 95% in varying school Boards, and some of the Board exams were also cancelled because of COVID,” said Shafey Kidwai, a spokesperson for Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). The AMU plans to draw on the expertise of the Indian Institutes of Technology and their Informatics Centre to provide the software and facilities needed to conduct an online test this year. UGC Member Secretary Rajnish Jain said that discussions are on to produce admission guidelines. Parity sought In Rajasthan, a meeting of State-run university Vice-Chancellors on Thursday agreed to go ahead with using Class XII marks, calculated by percentile to bring parity across Boards, as the criterion for admissions. Computer science was one of the papers cancelled by the CBSE. At a government-aided college in Coimbatore, the head of a computer science department said it would not matter as the Tamil Nadu State government rule is to use the average of physics, chemistry, mathematics and computer science marks anyway for admission to a B.Sc Computer Science programme. K.R. Venugopal, Vice-Chancellor of Bangalore University, said given the high marks scored by students, the university plans to sanction enhancement of intake of seats for high demand courses such as B.Com. in some colleges.

17 July 2020||CHENNAI/NEW DELHI,||IIS officers’ posting as DGs of AIR, DD irks programme staff||The programme staff of Prasar Bharati are agitated over the recent appointment of officials from the Indian Information Service (IIS) as Director Generals of All India Radio (AIR) and Doordarshan (DD) instead of from the Indian Broadcast Programming Service (IBPS). The DG charge of both AIR and DD has been given to IIS officers as additional charge. They are already heading the News Divisions of both. A programming side official in Tamil Nadu said both the IIS and IBPS were distinct services formed for specific purposes. “The IBPS ideates and creates content for programmes throughout the day. With proper and time-bound promotions, they become station directors. Whereas the IIS makes the news bulletins. They also head the other arms of Prasar Bharati like the Press Information Bureau,” he said. N. Tamilvanan, founder-Co convenor, Association of UPSC recruited Programme Officers of AIR and DD, said the Association had sent a legal notice to the DG, (AIR) questioning the appointment of an IIS officer as additional DG (programmes), which is an IBPS cadre post. “There are instances of persons from BSNL, MTNL and armed services being appointed in posts meant for IBPS personnel — 83 posts have been filled by such persons on deputation. But there is no provision for such deputation appointments,” he said. “The Board in its wisdom has taken a decision... The public broadcaster is in the process of undergoing a transformation to be a modern and competitive media organisation. It can no longer operate in the traditional silos defined based on cadres which is several decades old. Nothing unusual about such a process of transformation. Even the Railways saw such a transformation recently to do away with cadre based silos,” a senior official at Prasar Bharati said. Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar Vempati refused to comment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/iis-officers-posting-as-dgs-of-air-dd-irks-programme-staff/article32108026.ece
17 July 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Kerala govt. suspends Sivasankar, pending inquiry||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday said the government had suspended his former Principal Secretary M. Sivasankar from service pending a detailed inquiry. A committee headed by Chief Secretary Vishwas Mehta and Additional Chief Secretary, Finance, Rajesh Kumar Singh had found that Mr. Sivasankar had actively broken the rules that govern the conduct of civil service officers by “closely associating” with persons currently under investigation for gold smuggling and anti-national activity. The inquiry had centred on how Swapna Suresh, the second accused in the high-profile case, had dodged multiple layers of vetting to gain employment as marketing liaison officer of the government-run Space Park project. Swapna’s alleged association with Mr. Sivasankar had brought the scandal surrounding the attempt to smuggle gold via air cargo shipments addressed to the UAE consulate here awkwardly close to the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO). The stark reality of the national security implications of the case emerged in the public domain when the Central government ordered a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) that specialised in terrorist crimes. The development also led to increasingly strident calls from the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for Mr. Vijayan’s resignation. Swapna’s posting The committee had reportedly verified whether Mr. Sivasankar had used his administrative and political heft to nudge the plum posting in the direction of Swapna. Mr. Vijayan did not reveal the entire findings of the committee. But he said Mr. Mehta had frowned upon the practice of outsourcing appointments in IT Department projects to private consultancies or placement agencies. The Chief Secretary had suggested an institutionalised mechanism to insulate the recruitment process from extraneous influence, the Chief Minister said. Moreover, Mr. Mehta had also verified whether specific postings in the IT Department subsidiaries were in order. Mr. Vijayan said Arun Balachandran, whose name was linked by some sections of the media to the gold smuggling scandal, was no more an “IT Fellow” under his office. He said Mr. Balachandran, who had sat on the government's IT advisory body, had come with the reference of major stakeholders in the sector. The Customs had questioned Mr. Sivasankar in connection with the case on Wednesday. P.S. Sarith, the first accused in the case, will be produced before the Special Court of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday. Swapna Suresh and Sandeep, who were arrested by the NIA, earlier were slapped with the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, as the agency believed that the proceeds from the smuggling of gold were used for terror funding. Sarith also has been charged with the Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-govt-suspends-sivasankar-pending-inquiry/article32108036.ece
17 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||India registers a steep decline in maternal mortality ratio||The Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) in India has declined to 113 in 2016-18 from 122 in 2015-17 and 130 in 2014-2016, according to the special bulletin on Maternal Mortality in India 2016-18, released by the Office of the Registrar General’s Sample Registration System (SRS), which provides estimates on fertility and mortality.  Key indicators One of the key indicators of maternal mortality is the MMR, defined as the number of maternal deaths per 1,00,000 live births. The target 3.1 of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) set by the United Nations aims to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 1,00,000 live births. The MMR of various States according to the bulletin includes Assam (215), Bihar (149), Madhya Pradesh (173), Chhattisgarh (159), Odisha (150), Rajasthan (164), Uttar Pradesh (197) and Uttarakhand (99). Southern States The southern States registered a lower MMR — Andhra Pradesh (65), Telangana (63), Karnataka (92), Kerala (43) and Tamil Nadu (60). “Maternal mortality in a region is a measure of reproductive health of women in the area. Many women in the reproductive age-span die due to complications during and following pregnancy and childbirth or abortion. As per the World Health Organization, maternal death is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management,” noted the bulletin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-registers-a-steep-decline-in-maternal-mortality-ratio/article32108141.ece
17 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Judicial review can’t be done prior to Speaker’s decision’||Constitutional courts cannot judicially review disqualification proceedings under the Tenth Schedule (anti-defection law) of the Constitution until the Speaker or Chairman makes a final decision on merits. A 28-year-old judgment of the Supreme Court in Kihoto Hollohan versus Zachillu and Others has said that “judicial review cannot be available at a stage prior to the making of a decision by the Speaker/Chairman and a quia timet action would not be permissible. Nor would interference be permissible at an interlocutory stage of the proceedings.” “The only exception for any interlocutory interference being cases of interlocutory disqualifications or suspensions which may have grave, immediate and irreversible repercussions and consequence,” the Bench had held. The judgment is significant in the case of ousted Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot and the 18 MLAs, who were issued notice under the anti-defection law after the ruling Congress sought their disqualification. They have approached the Rajasthan High Court challenging the constitutionality of Paragraph 2(1)(a) of the Tenth Schedule which makes “voluntarily giving up membership of a political party” liable for disqualification.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/judicial-review-cant-be-done-prior-to-speakers-decision/article32108075.ece
17 July 2020||Chennai,||‘Is India a hub for drug peddling?’||Observing that Punjab is serving as the transit point for the smuggling of narcotic drugs which make their way as far as Kerala, the Madras High Court has directed the Centre to spell out whether India is being used as a hub by international drug cartels. It also asked if the money involved was being used to fund terrorists and anti-national activities. A Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and V. M. Velumani said: “We have a bad experience in the State of Punjab where youngsters and students are mostly addicted to drugs and the same situation should not be allowed to spread to other States. It is known that Punjab is the transit point on the drug route and the State has become a major consumer base.” The judges said the High Court of Kerala, too, had taken a suo motu public interest litigation petition recently on the basis of a letter written by retired IPS officer N. Ramachandran, highlighting the increase in drug abuse cases and related crimes. The Kerala police filed an affidavit conceding that educational institutions had become a hotbed of drug peddlers. Further, the Bench referred to a recent survey by the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment in association with the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), which revealed that 3.1 crore Indians use cannabis, bhang , ganja , charas , heroin and opium. However, the Bench said, only one in 20 drug addicts gets treatment at a hospital. “The problem of drug addiction of children is more prevalent in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi and Haryana. It is a fact that many youngsters, especially students, are getting addicted due to easy availability of narcotic drugs,” the judges said. ‘Explain the steps taken’ They directed the Centre to explain by June 28 the steps it had taken so far to curb the menace. The court also wanted to know about the involvement of international drug mafias in crime, the approximate value of drugs transacted in the country, and the remedial measures undertaken by the Centre. The queries were posed in interim orders passed on a habeas corpus petition which had challenged the preventive detention of a drug peddler under the Goondas Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/is-india-a-hub-for-drug-peddling/article32108087.ece

17 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Panel put off decision on J&K internet issue’||The Union government on Thursday informed the Supreme Court that a special committee, chaired by Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, met twice to review the restrictions placed on 4G Internet connections in Jammu and Kashmir but deferred a decision considering the “startling situation” of continued terror attacks in the Valley. Attorney General K.K. Venugopal informed a three-judge Bench, led by Justice N.V. Ramana, that the committee had called for “further reports” from J&K while agreeing to meet after two months. Both Mr. Venugopal and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the J&K administration, were responding to a contempt petition filed by Foundation for Media Professionals that the special committee was not formed in compliance with a judgment of the top court on May 11 to review the need to continue with the “blanket restrictions” on 4G Internet access, especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi and advocate Shadan Farasat, for the foundation, questioned the government’s stand in court. They referred to a statement reportedly made by Home Minister Amit Shah on May 31 in a media interview that terrorism was down in J&K. Mr. Ahmadi also referred to an opinion piece by Ram Madhav, J&K interlocutor, in favour of doing away with 4G restrictions in the State. But both Mr. Venugopal and Mr. Mehta said there was “no question” of contempt action against the government as the committee was set up and a decision taken. “Your Lordships’ direction has been complied with. The committee was constituted. There is no question of contempt here,” Mr. Mehta said. Mr. Venugopal said he was willing to place the minutes of the meeting of the committee before the court in a sealed cover. The court directed the law officers to file their response in a week. Mr. Ahmadi and Mr. Farasat said the court judgment required the government to review the 4G ban on a weekly basis and publish its orders so that its deliberations were in the public eye. “The idea was not pass orders and keep it in the drawer,” Mr. Ahmadi submitted. Students in J&K were unable to access educational tools online and citizens had no access to medical care. “What people in other parts of the country can access, the people in J&K cannot. This is an infringement on their right under Article 21 of the Constitution,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/panel-put-off-decision-on-jk-internet-issue/article32108153.ece
17 July 2020||New Delhi,||Cong. keeps channels open with Sachin Pilot||“There would be no restoring status quo ante but Sachin Pilot could be accommodated later on if he returns and stops hobnobbing with the BJP,” said a Congress source. “From the choice of the lawyers defending him and his supporters, it is clear where his affiliations lie now,” he said. Worried about bad optics, especially after the high-profile desertion of Jyotiraditya Scindia in March, the Congress has gone on overdrive to stop Mr. Pilot. Apart from Priyanka Gandhi Vadra speaking to the rebel Congress leader on Wednesday, senior leaders Ahmed Patel and K.C. Venugopal have also been in touch with him. ‘Good TV bytes’ Despite Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot publicly accusing his former deputy of conniving with the BJP to topple his government, the Central leadership has not snapped the communication lines with Mr. Pilot. “After doing the deal, our former PCC chief gave statements that no horse-trading was taking place. What clarifications were you giving when you yourself were involved in it?” Mr. Gehlot told reporters in Jaipur on Wednesday and added that speaking good English, giving good television bytes and being handsome was not everything in politics. Rahul irked Annoyed by the tone and tenor of Mr. Gehlot, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi asked party’s communication chief Randeep Surjewala to hold another press conference to allow Mr. Pilot a “dignified option” of staying in the Congress. “The Congress has already expressed willingness to resolve all issues with Mr. Pilot. Since he has ruled out joining the BJP, he should stop speaking through media and come here as a member of the Congress family,” Mr. Surjewala said at the press conference, hours after Mr. Gehlot’s outburst.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-keeps-channels-open-with-sachin-pilot/article32108067.ece

17 July 2020||HYDERABAD,||Stay on Secretariat demolition extended||Extending the order staying demolition of Secretariat buildings by one more day, the Telangana High Court on Thursday instructed the Centre to clarify by Friday if an environmental clearance certificate from it was mandatory for demolition of a building. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy would hear the PIL petition challenging demolition of Secretariat buildings again on Friday. When the hearing resumed in the morning, the bench said the two documents presented by the State government, one by the Telangana State Pollution Control Board and another by the State Level Environmental Assessment Authority (SLEAA), were not clear and could not help the court to arrive at a conclusion. The bench observed that the two reports did not clarify if environmental clearance from the Union Ministry of Environment and Forest is mandatory for pulling down a building. The bench instructed Assistant Solicitor General N. Rajeshwar Rao to secure instructions form the ministry on this point. The Chief Justice told the Assistant Solicitor General to ascertain from the ministry whether demolition of a building for preparing the land for future construction requires prior environmental clearance. “Whether demolition of a building falls within the meaning of preparation of land should also be clarified,” the bench said. Seeking the clarification, the bench cited two examples. A person having 500 trees in his land wanted to erect a structure. Does he or she need to secure permission to cut the trees to construct a building?, the High Court bench said. Another example In another example cited, the High Court bench said that a person had land with boulders which had heritage tag. If that land owner wanted to blast the boulders to level and clear the land, is a permission required. Referring to the SLEAA document presented in the court, the bench said it had said that its permission is required for any construction over land of 20,000 square metres to one lakh square metres. The bench observed that on one hand the government wants to enhance greenery and improve environment in the State by taking up programmes like Haritha Haram and on the other it claims that it does not need environmental clearance for demolition of Secretariat building. In the backdrop of global warming, ensuring ecological balance is the government’s responsibility, it said. The bench also asked Advocate General B.S. Prasad to clarify on preparation of the land. The Advocate General contended that demolition of building did not fall under preparation of land. The bench directed the Advocate General if that was the government’s interpretation or if it was upheld by the National Green Tribunal, any High Court or the Supreme Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/stay-on-secretariat-demolition-extended/article32108369.ece

Party sources told The Hindu that the Chief Minister and the available party secretariat members discussed the National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe and the Customs inquiry in the case. Since the government has already entrusted a panel headed by the Chief Secretary to probe the association of former Principal Secretary M. Sivasankar with the accused, the party top brass has entrusted Mr. Vijayan to take adequate steps at the earliest. The sources described as unfounded reports that there were differences of opinion between the CPI and the CPI(M) on the action to be taken against the former Principal Secretary. The party secretariat on Friday would take stock of the latest developments and chart out a course of action, the sources said. Protocol violation Meanwhile, Central government sources said that Minister for Higher Education K.T. Jaleel had violated the protocol by directly interacting with the UAE Consulate officials here. As per the Central Protocol Rule Book, Chief Ministers and Ministers outside Delhi are not expected to accept invitations from such institutions or their officials directly.

Posts trying to dupe people into sending hackers the virtual currency Bitcoin were tweeted by the official accounts of Apple, Uber, Kanye West, Bill Gates, Barack Obama and many others on Wednesday. “We detected what we believe to be a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools,” Twitter said. The posts said people had 30 minutes to send $1,000 in the cryptocurrency, promising double returns. A total of 12.58 bitcoins — worth almost $116,000 — were sent to e-mail addresses mentioned in the tweets, according to the site Blockchain.com, which monitors crypto transactions. “Tough day for us at Twitter,” chief executive Jack Dorsey said in a tweet. “We all feel terrible this happened. We’re diagnosing and will share everything we can when we have a more complete understanding of exactly what happened.” Twitter said it had locked down the affected accounts and removed the tweets posted by the hackers. “Most accounts should be able to Tweet again,” the Twitter support team said in an evening update, having earlier temporarily disabled all posts from verified accounts with an official blue checkmark. But the company told users that it “may take further actions and will update you if we do”. U.S. President Donald Trump’s account, which has more than 83 million followers, was not among those targeted, but many specialist Bitcoin firms were.  Vice reported that a Twitter insider was responsible, citing leaked screenshots and two anonymous sources apparently behind the hack, one of whom told the media outlet they had paid the employee. U.S. Senator Josh Hawley tweeted a letter to Mr. Dorsey, expressing concern over privacy for the San Francisco-based company’s millions of users worldwide.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/twitter-hack-targets-high-profile-users/article32108041.ece

They said he had issued the impugned notices with “mala fide intentions”. Mr. Gehlot, they said, had ordered an inquiry by the Special Operations Group (SOG) to threaten Mr. Pilot and his supporters. On the other hand, Mr. Pilot had clearly said he had no intention of leaving the Congress and he continued to extend his allegiance to the ruling party, said the petition. “In a democratic set-up, the actions of an elected representative who merely seeks to voice his disagreement with certain policies or decisions cannot be said to amount to acting against the interest of the party,” it said. The notices were an abuse of powers under the Tenth Schedule to “stifle the freedom of speech” of the petitioners and to impose the “majoritarian views of the party” on them, the petition contended. The MLAs also alleged that Mr. Joshi’s complaint was based on assumptions and surmises, having no factual ground to support the alleged apprehension voiced in it.

Earlier reports had suggested that Pakistan was willing to consider a review petition through a legal representative to appeal against the death sentence given to Mr. Jadhav by a military tribunal but the absence of written consent makes the prospect of a legal representative impossible. In view of the difficulties in the meeting, the two diplomats, Charge d’Affaires Gaurav Ahluwalia and First Secretary Cherakung Zeliang left the meeting after protesting against the “intimidation” from the Pakistani side. ‘India not serious’ A press release from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan said, “Two consular officers of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad were provided unimpeded and uninterrupted consular access to Commander Jadhav at 3 p.m.” Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in a TV interview claimed that India was not serious about the process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pak-did-not-allow-free-access-to-jadhav-india/article32108043.ece

The statement came from the Official Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava who did not respond directly to Prime Minister K.P Sharma Oli’s comments about Ayodhya and Lord Ram, saying the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nepal had already clarified the matter.  Prime Minister Oli had remarked on Monday that Ramchandra, the lead protagonist of the epic Ramayana , was born in a Nepalese village near the border town of Birgunj. He had described India’s Ayodhya as part of a “fake” Indian narrative. Nepal’s Foreign Ministry had, in a statement, clarified that the Prime Minister of Nepal did not intend to hurt any community with his comments on Lord Ram, but maintained that it was necessary to study the Ramayana and the characters associated with it further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/world-knows-about-our-rich-heritage-india/article32108052.ece

Obvious ploy to protect top management & sacrifice employees. Move violates labour norms, is anti-worker & arbitrary is match-fixing for proposed #AirIndia buyers. Retrenchment in a new name,” he tweeted. Mr. O’Brien was referring to an order issued by the airline on July 14 asking various regional managers and departmental heads to identify staff members who could be sent on such leave for six months to two years, extendable up to five years. At a press conference, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Puri responded to the criticism, saying: “We have to face the reality. The government may not be in a position [to support Air India] by virtue of other demands being made of it [during a pandemic]. But it will be done keeping in view the interest of all those who have served the airline. Cuts will be across the board.” The Minister said, “Today all airlines are doing pay cuts. If you don't cut costs, then equity infusion of Rs. 5,000 crore to Rs. 6,000 crore by the government every year in not sustainable.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ais-leave-without-pay-move-arbitrary-obrien/article32108072.ece
17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Seek His feet||The Bhagavad Gita says samsara is not easily understood. While it is true that we understand it superficially, we do not understand all that it implies, said Valayapet Ramachariar in a discourse. To have that degree of understanding we must have knowledge of the Vedas. The Vedas tell you about how to attain liberation, and so long as you do not know how to attain moksha, you will be stuck in samsara. A tree must be fixed in some place, and Lord Krishna uses the word ‘sampratishtA’ when He talks of the samsaric tree. Because of our ajnana, we mistake the body for the atma, and this is responsible for samsara. The root of a tree is fixed in the earth. Karma is the root of samsara, and it is fixed in ajnana. This tree has very strong roots. These roots are not easily destroyed. We perform actions, which have consequences. If we try to atone for something wrong that we have done, even in that very process we do more wrong. Nor is it possible for us to atone for every wrong deed. And it is not just wrong deeds that keep us tied to samsara. Punya also keeps us tied to samsara, for punyas take us to svarga, from where we are reborn and again go through the same cycle of action, consequences, birth and death. Assuming we are detached, for how long do we remain so? Our detachment must come from our knowledge of that nature of samsara. Only then it is dridhena — firm and unchanging. Otherwise, we are detached when we face some trouble, and at such times we show vairagya. But the moment the trouble is tided over, then we go back to being attached to everything. Such wavering is of no use. But this detachment is difficult to attain, because our attachment to sense objects is purANI — timeless. The only way to develop detachment is to surrender at the feet of Lord Narayana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/seek-his-feet/article32108083.ece

Shreyams Kumar appears to have blown over for the time being with the national leadership conceding to the collective demand of the State leadership to revoke the decision. The sudden change of guard by installing all-India general secretary Varughese George as the new president caused a flutter here. On Wednesday, LJD national general secretary Sushila Morale officially informed that Mr. George had been appointed as the party State president with immediate effect by national president Fateh Singh and that Mr. Shreyams Kumar, at the helm of the party for the past two years, has been appointed as the national general secretary. However, the State office-bearers, district presidents and State chiefs of feeder organisations urgently conducted a Google meeting on Thursday and reposed their faith in the leadership of Mr. Shreyams Kumar. They urged the national leadership to rescind its arbitrary decision. A resolution to this effect was also adopted at the meeting. “The State unit rejected the decision of the national leadership to replace Mr. Shreyams Kumar,” State secretary general Sheikh P. Haris said. Mr. George, who was absent at the meeting, however, sent a voice message saying that he was withdrawing from his new post and that he would inform the decision to the national leadership.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ljd-crisis-blows-over-temporarily/article32108414.ece

17 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||After a long wait, students prepare for the next step||In 2019, students who wrote the Plus Two exams in March had to wait for less than a month before the results were announced mid-April. This year, however, things have been very different. Even as a national lockdown was enforced to check the spread of COVID-19, Tamil Nadu students were writing their last board exam. “It has been a long wait for us,” said K.B. Sirajudeen, a student of Everwin Matriculation School. Many changes Students like him have had a gap of over three months, which has brought about many changes and some re-thinking of decisions on their higher studies. “While I had initially decided to write the JEE, I decided to wait for the results and apply for the Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions counselling instead,” he said. For Gayathri Thejusee, the long gap has meant being able to devote time to prepare for the NEET. “I enrolled in a summer crash course for medical entrance only after my board exams. I thought I would have only a month in between,” she said. Sujitha, a student of the Government Girls Higher Secondary School, MGR Nagar, said that while the last three months had been uncertain, she spent her time reading up and exploring her interest in animation. “I’ve got 528 marks and hope to pursue computer applications. Many of us were waiting for the results to begin applying for colleges,” she said. For many government school students in smaller districts, teachers say there is a dire need for guidance in what to do next and sensitise them on the options available, especially since schools remained shut and there had been nearly no student-teacher interaction in the last three months. Need for guidance “The State government should rope in PG subject teachers at the taluk level and bring in educationalists and NGOs to offer career guidance for these students. We feel that the marks for students in rural areas have gone down this year, and they may have some concerns over what to do next,” said K.P.O. Suresh, president of the Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association. Given the current situation and the restrictions put in place in view of the pandemic, Mr. Suresh suggested that students be given the contact numbers of senior teachers and Education Department officials in each district, who can help them in the online application process, too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/after-a-long-wait-students-prepare-for-the-next-step/article32108213.ece
17 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||1,606 pregnant women infected so far||Till now, 1,606 pregnant women have tested positive for COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu, said Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar. “Of this, 1,104 women have been discharged, and the rest are under treatment,” he said in Chennai on Thursday. The Minister, along with Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan, inspected the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (IOG) and Hospital for Women and Children, Egmore. At IOG alone, 400 pregnant women, who tested positive for COVID-19, were admitted in the last three months. Of them, 374 have been discharged. “Usually, IOG handles 60 deliveries a day. The hospital started receiving pregnant women who tested positive for COVID-19 and it has so far discharged 374 of them, who had normal deliveries and caesarean sections,” he said. There were pregnant women with co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and breathlessness. “In the last three months, the hospital has registered zero maternal deaths, though there were instances of last-minute referrals from other hospitals. They have managed to take care of both the mother and the child,” he said. Noting that swabs were lifted from newborns for COVID-19 testing, he said that among them, 39 had tested positive at IOG, accounting for nearly 10%-12%. “There were no major issues with newborns who tested positive for COVID-19. The babies were kept under observation in isolation. Both the mothers and the children were safely discharged after testing negative for COVID-19.”  CEmONC centres He added that Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (CEmONC) centres in the State had separate pathways, antenatal wards, labour rooms, operation theatres and post-natal wards for women testing positive for COVID-19. The staff were provided with personal protective equipment (PPE). “Through the National Health Mission, we had constituted a high-level committee to come up with a special protocol for the care of antenatal women who test positive for COVID-19. Dos and don’ts were provided for all CEmONC centres, while the protocols for treatment were shared with the doctors,” he added. The protocols were shared with obstetricians in the private sector too, he said. “When compared to private hospitals and primary health centres, more deliveries were conducted at these CEmONC centres during the pandemic. All CEmONC centres, including those in Madurai, Tiruchi, Chengalpattu and Villupuram, are fully equipped to carry out treatment,” he said. A nutritional diet, combined with a Siddha diet, was provided to the patients at all CEmONC centres. He added that the rapid response committee analysed cases and found no major risk in the 0-20 age group. “There were one or two deaths in this age group. This is rare and needs to be studied,” he said. All District Collectors, Joint Directors of Health Services and deans of government medical college hospitals were advised on the precautionary measures to be undertaken to prevent diseases during the rainy season.  There were no major issues with newborns who tested positive for COVID-19. The babies were kept under observation in isolation C.

In a circular to all principal district judges in Tamil Nadu and the Chief Judge of Puducherry, the High Court’s Registrar-General, C. Kumarappan, has called for their views on implementing the mobile virtual court plan. He wanted to know whether the judicial officers had the financial resources to implement it at the earliest in their districts. Experimental basis The idea of mobile courts emanated from Pudukottai principal district judge J.A. Kokila, who had implemented it on an experimental basis. In a letter to the High Court on July 9, she said the Legal Services Authority in her district had experimented with it in view of the challenges posed by COVID-19. A mobile court was conducted in the Thirumalairayasamuthiram panchayat, consisting of 19 villages, and the proceedings of 13 admission cases falling under the jurisdiction of the judicial magistrate-I were held through that virtual court. “It gave us the confidence to achieve the concept of delivering justice at the doorsteps of the downtrodden,” she said. Urging the High Court to accord permission for making the mobile court a permanent feature in her district, the judicial officer said it would cost around Rs. 500 a day towards fuel expenses and Rs. 599 for an unlimited mobile Internet pack for three months. Vans already available with the District Legal Services Authority could be pressed into service. Such vans could carry laptops with web cameras, modems, speakers, scanners, document viewers and a 2KVA power backup. The vehicles could be stationed at the local panchayat union office or any other government office with permission and litigants residing nearby could be called for attending the proceedings, she said. The facility could be utilised for appearance of litigants/witnesses for conducting cases at any stage. One court staff member, not below the rank of junior assistant, with technical knowledge could be deployed as the coordinator, and para-legal volunteers could also be sent to provide legal aid to the villagers simultaneously, Ms. Kokila suggested. She said the proceedings could be conducted by following physical distancing norms and after ensuring that the team travelling in the mobile courts was provided with face masks, infra-red thermometers, sanitizers, hand-gloves and first aid kits. Her letter to the High Court Registry was placed before the Chief Justice for approval. Impressed with the idea, he directed the Registrar-General to seek the views of all Principal District Judges so that comprehensive instructions could be issued.  It gave us the confidence to achieve the concept of delivering justice at the doorsteps of the downtrodden J.A. Kokila Pudukottai principal district judge||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/taking-justice-to-the-doorsteps-of-litigants/article32108222.ece
17 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||At 73, from Chennai to Nanguneri on a cycle||Pandian, a septuagenarian, cycled all the way from Chennai to Nanguneri in Tirunelveli district during the ongoing COVID-19 lockdown, suprising family members and villagers. The 73-year-old started from Chennai on June 23 and reached his village Deivanayagaperi on July 1. He then isolated himself for two weeks in the local Sudalaimadan temple. On July 15, he entered his house. “I have a cell phone. But whenever my wife, who stays with my son in Chennai, called, I would not pick up, because she would ask me to come back. There were 75 missed calls from her,” said Mr. Pandian, who works as a cashier in a hotel in Changanassery, Kerala. He had come to Chennai to see his son who was not keeping well. The lockdown, however, forced him to remain in his son’s house. Mr. Pandian, who did not know how to get an e-pass, cycled to Tindivanam after receiving information that a bus would depart for Tirunelveli from there. “But there was no carrier in the bus to keep my cycle. I cycled further to Villupuram and there was no bus there either. Someone saw me waiting for a bus and gave me a bottle of water and Rs. 50,” said Mr. Pandian. In Ulundurpet, help came from a hotel owner who was a native of Mr. Pandian’s village. “A lot of people from my area run hotels in several places. Jayaraman was one among them. He offered me food, but I just had a cup of coffee. He then gave me Rs. 1,000 for expenses on the way,” recalled Mr. Pandian.  He reached Tiruchi in a vehicle carrying vegetables. He resumed cycling thereafter and reached Viralimalai, where a tea stall owner came forward to help him. “He let me sleep outside his stall,” said Mr. Pandian. “There is no dearth of help,” he added. He had to continue cycling even when it was raining in Madurai and neighbouring areas. Heavy winds in Sattur and Kovilpatti forced him to walk, pushing his cycle along. “I somehow reached Tirunelveli and spent the night at the new bus stand. I reached my village the next day,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/at-73-from-chennai-to-nanguneri-on-a-cycle/article32108230.ece

The government cited the COVID-19 lockdown for not updating the details. Justices M.M. Sundresh and R. Hemalatha recorded the submissions made by CMPRF treasurer P.A. Parimala Chelvi, in a counter affidavit filed last month, that steps were being taken to upload all details on the web portal through the National Informatics Centre (NIC). The submissions were made in response to a public interest litigation petition filed by advocate M. Karpagam through her counsel R. Prabhakaran. The petitioner complained that details regarding the donations received towards CMPRF had not been made public. In response, Ms. Chelvi said, “The government does not deny the fact that it is the right of the citizens to access information. Further, the government has nothing to suppress about the CMPRF and the honourable Chief Minister has issued press releases every week.” Stating that the donations were received through cheques and online payment gateways, she said: “Due to the lockdown, many government offices have been functioning with minimum staff and therefore, it has not been possible to update/integrate the details.” She added, “Nevertheless, in future, the government will upgrade the website with more information.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-grants-eight-weeks-to-state-to-update-details-of-cmprf/article32108228.ece
17 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||IIT-M alumni build portable hospitals, inclusive of ICU||A start-up incubated at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-M) has developed portable hospital units. MediCAB is a 15-bed pre-fabricated unit comprising separate rooms for doctors, isolation and medical checks, in addition to an intensive care unit. The unit, already deployed in Wayanad district, Kerala, can be installed by just four people in two hours. Modulus Housing collaborated with Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology for inputs on certification and customisation. The start-up developed the micro hospitals with four zones — a doctor’s room, an isolation room, a medical room/ward and a twin-bed ICU maintained at negative pressure. Habitat for Humanity’s Terwilliger Centre for Innovation in Shelter funded the deployment in Kerala. Modulus Housing was founded by two IIT alumni in 2018, and is supported by IIT-M’s incubation cell. It has set up its manufacturing unit in Chengalpattu, around 35 km from Chennai. The start-up repurposed its design to build micro-hospitals in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The start-up’s chief executive officer, Shreeram Ravichandran, said, “The outcome of the pilot project in Kerala will help prove the applicability of the technology and the advantages of micro hospitals. It can be easily assembled in hours by four people. When folded, our collapsible cabins are reduced five-fold, making it cost-effective for transportation.” According to him, the structures will be particularly helpful in rural areas, where the population density is relatively low. The start-up has already supplied foldable cabins to clients such as L&T, the TATA group, Shapoorji Pallonji group and Selco, among others.  The outcome of the pilot project in Kerala will help prove the applicability of the technology and the advantages of micro hospitals Shreeram Ravichandran CEO, Modulus Housing||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/iit-m-alumni-build-portable-hospitals-inclusive-of-icu/article32108232.ece
17 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK demands ordinance to dispense with NEET||The DMK on Thursday urged the Centre to cancel the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to medical courses and instead use Class XII marks to draw up the merit list. A resolution adopted at the party’s meeting of district secretaries, MLAs and MPs urged the AIADMK government to promulgate an ordinance to dispense with the NEET in Tamil Nadu. The meeting also made a strong case for cancellation of semester examinations in colleges across the State. The virtual meeting, chaired by party president M.K. Stalin, said that NEET had destroyed the hopes of the poor, middle class and rural students aspiring to become doctors and prevented the creation of adequate medical professionals for rural medical services. Lacking political will “Even though a resolution against the NEET was adopted in the Legislative Assembly, lack of political will has come in the way of obtaining the Centre’s nod. The AIADMK government does not have the courage to oppose the announcement that NEET would be conducted on November 13,” the resolution said. Rejecting the University Grants Commission’s direction that the final semester examinations in colleges should be conducted in September, the meeting said the UGC had taken the decision without taking into account the ground realities in the country. “The direction should be viewed as an encroachment on the rights of the State governments. Schools and colleges are used as treatment centres for COVID-19 patients. Parents and students are living in different places,” said the resolution, which urged the government to declare students as having completed the courses. The meeting also decided to hoist black flags in houses of DMK cadre to highlight the anomalies in the electricity tariff and the Tangedco’s failure to give concession to consumers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-demands-ordinance-to-dispense-with-neet/article32108218.ece
17 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Subject all inmates of Institute of Mental Health to tests’||The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the State government to subject all inmates of the Institute of Mental Health in Kilpauk, Chennai, to COVID-19 tests within a week and provide appropriate treatment to those testing positive for the infection. Justices M.M. Sundresh and R. Hemalatha passed the order on a public interest litigation petition filed by the Tamil Nadu Association for the Rights of All Types of Differently-Abled and Caregivers (TARATDAC), represented by its secretary S. Namburajan. Though a Special Government Pleader stated that all COVID-19 patients were treated equally, the judges rejected his submission and agreed with petitioner’s counsel C. Karl Marx that the mentally challenged could not be equated on a par with others. Observing that the inmates of IMH might not be in a position to even disclose the symptoms, the judges felt that it would only be appropriate to test them all, since many were aged and suffering from co-morbidities such as blood pressure and diabetes. In his affidavit, Mr. Namburajan had insisted on shifting those testing positive either to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital or the special COVID-19 care hospital at the Kings Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research in Guindy, Chennai, and treating them in a special ward. Selective testing Mr. Namburajan said that a cook serving at the IMH had tested positive for COVID-19 initially. Thereafter, two wardens, three postgraduate students and even the director of the institute had tested positive. It led to five inmates from the institute testing positive for the infection in the first week of July and the number continued to rise. Stating that the State government was testing only select inmates suffering from severe symptoms, the litigant association insisted on subjecting all IMH inmates to testing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/subject-all-inmates-of-institute-of-mental-health-to-tests/article32108233.ece

While talking at the webinar of The Hindu Wellness Series on ‘Self-Medication: Why is it a matter for serious dialogue’, he said people had been indulging in self-medication during this crisis and otherwise. “People can get even advanced generation antibiotics over the counter. Until this issue is handled the problem of self-medication will continue,” Dr. Rajagopalan said. He added that it was illegal for pharmacies to dispense medicines without a prescription or doctor’s recommendation. Usha Sriram, consultant, diabetes and endocrinology said one of the important downsides of self-medication is that it masks diagnosis. “These days, people even self-medicate with hydroxycholoroquine, thinking they are not going to get COVID-19,” she said. Popping vitamin tablets like candy should be avoided, Dr. Sriram said, and added that everything should be done in moderation and under medical advice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/why-self-medication-could-do-you-more-harm/article32108212.ece

17 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Stay in touch with doctors to keep your ailment in check’||The COVID-19 pandemic has left many people without an opportunity to consult their doctor or go for tests to ensure their parameters are normal. At an online consultation on Thursday, organised by the Tamil Nadu Gastroenterologist Trust, several patients consulted doctors about their problems.   The doctors, K.R. Palaniswamy, V. Balasubramanian, Ashok Chacko, and P. Piramanayagan, took questions from patients, who were from other countries as well. Several patients wanted advise for their specific problems, to which the doctors said they could call them personally over the phone and consult. A patient wanted to know if Vitamin C could cause constipation. Dr. Balasubramanian said the best way to find out what worked or what did not is to avoid the item for 10 days and check the result. Medications Doctors uniformly said patients should continue the medication prescribed for their conditions. They advised patients to be careful and cautious so as not to contract the infection. Patients should keep their disease in control and avoid junk food. At a time when periodic testing had been kept in abeyance, it is important to take utmost care of one’s health by regularly checking the usual parameters, the doctors advised.

17 July 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||I-T dept. seeks compensation from Jayalalithaa’s estate||The State government on Thursday told the Madras High Court that apart from former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s niece J. Deepa and nephew J. Deepak, the Income Tax (I-T) department too had responded to a notice issued for acquisition of her residence Veda Nilayam at Poes Garden here and payment of compensation. Appearing before Justice N. Anand Venkatesh, Advocate General Vijay Narayan said the official concerned had recently issued a notice under Section 21 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act of 2013 inviting claims to compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement. Though the niece and nephew had responded to the notice in their capacity as legal heirs, the I-T department too had staked claim for compensation on the ground that it had to collect arrears of around Rs. 30 crore. Some cases regarding that were also pending in the High Court following orders passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, he said. The submissions were made during the hearing of a writ petition filed by Mr. Deepak challenging the acquisition proceedings. He claimed that Jayalalithaa had treated her residence as a temple and it was her wish that the family should continue to maintain it after her death. The petitioner also claimed that she never wanted it to be converted into a memorial. His counsel S.L. Sudarsanam also brought it to the notice of the judge that a Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and Abdul Quddhose had on May 27 declared his client and the latter’s sister as Jayalalithaa’s legal heirs. It also directed them to allot a few of the properties for creation of a public trust to be named after her and report compliance within eight weeks. Since the eight-week period would get over in another 10 days, Justice Venkatesh directed the High Court Registry to list the present writ petition too before the Division Bench after obtaining necessary approval from Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi. He, however, refrained from passing any interim order restraining the government from proceeding further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/i-t-dept-seeks-compensation-from-jayalalithaas-estate/article32108242.ece

Acharya, a goldsmith in Coimbatore, announced the sale of masks woven with gold and silver strands a few days ago. Since then, he says he has been receiving enquiries from different parts of the country. Mr. Acharya said that he makes the masks with thin strands of gold and silver. He started making jackets and dresses using gold and silver strands three years ago. “I developed the product three years ago. I like to innovate and wanted to make masks now. However, when people were dying of COVID-19, I initially felt it would not be appropriate. But now, people wear masks for weddings. They can wear ones made of gold or silver,” he said. The masks have three layers of fabric, in addition to one layer of the precious metal. “It takes about a week to complete a mask, as 90% of the work is done by hand. About 50g-60g gold or 50g-55g of silver is used for a good mask,” he added. Only 22 or 18-carat gold can be used and customers ask for hallmark certification as well. “I delivered one gold and one silver mask today [Thursday]. The gold mask had a hallmark cerficiation,” he said, adding that the cost depended on the weight of the mask. Multiple enquiries These masks are flexible and can be washed too. But the mask should not be squeezed while washing. There had been a lot of enquiries from the northern States, Bengaluru and Chennai, said Mr. Acharya. His entire family works in his workshop and he has made several innovative products. “I started making dresses for temple idols using this technology. Then I made flowers, garlands, turbans and children’s dresses, among other things. This is a family business and only my family members know how to make these products. If the number of orders are high, I plan to patent the technology,” Mr. Acharya added.  It takes about a week to complete a mask, as 90% of the work is done by hand.

17 July 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Fever clinics help in identifying cases||Fever camps held in the city from June 26 to July 13 detected 1,636 COVID-19 positive cases through swab samples lifted from 10,197 persons and they had influenza-like-illness (ILI), reveals data obtained from the Madurai Corporation. The positivity rate stands at 16.04%. Since the announcement of intensified lockdown in Madurai from June 24, the corporation used fever camps as a key strategy to detect symptomatic persons and isolate them. It increased the number of fever camps since July 8 and 155 camps were held across the city during the period. Subsequently, the number of people, who were screened in fever camps, also went up, with around 1.28 lakh people screened during this period. Only 9.54% of the people were identified with ILI symptoms out of those who were screened at fever camps. Details of ward-level identification of ILI cases within the Madurai Corporation from July 6 to July 13 show that out of 9,376 ILI cases identified during this period, the contribution of fever camps was the highest with around 78.74%. The rest were from private hospitals and Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH). The highest number of ILI cases identified was 314 at Solaialagupuram (ward 88). Though fever clinics played a major role in identifying ILI cases in the city, wards like BB Kulam, Ponnagaram, Ellis Nagar, K.K Nagar, Chinna Anuppanadi, Avaniapuram, Palanganatham, Sundararajapuram and Jaihindpuram had the highest number of ILI cases identified through private hospitals. In Ponnagaram and Palanganatham, the number of cases identified in private hospitals was more than those identified through fever clinics and GRH. “In many wards which had more ILI cases identified in private hospitals, the residents are from economically privileged families, who do not reveal their symptoms to field workers from fever clinics. Their fear that screening and treatment is improper at UPHCs is unwarranted,” said City Health Officer P. Kumaraguruparan. The data reveals that swab samples lifted through fever clinics had drastically increased and as high as 1,844 swab samples were lifted on a single day during this period. “Our strategy in containing the spread of COVID-19 is to increase testing and strict containment of those who had tested positive for COVID-19. We ensured that almost all those with ILI symptoms and their contacts are tested for COVID-19,”said the CHO. Swab samples are being lifted at all 31 Urban Primary Health Centres, four ESI dispensaries and 26 mobile vehicles, where fever clinics are conducted. “In addition, we have equipped eight light commercial vehicles with lab technicians and kits to collect swabs from the doorstep of residents,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fever-clinics-help-in-identifying-cases/article32108511.ece

17 July 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC issues directions to police on opening history sheet||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has issued a set of directions to police personnel to follow while exercising their power to open a history sheet against someone. The court observed that there were certain vagueness and internal inconsistencies in the choice of expressions the Police Standing Order employs. Disposing of a series of petitions that sought a direction to remove petitioners’ names from the history sheet, Justice N. Seshasayee observed that these vagueness and internal inconsistencies posed a constant threat to the fundamental rights that ultimately led to unnecessary and avoidable litigations. Passing a series of directions for the police to follow, the court observed that there was a need to harmonise and iron out the ambiguities till legislative alternatives were found. The police personnel may have to be provided with clear parameters for exercising their power to history-sheet, the court said. When the police propose to history-sheet a person, he should have been either notified as a habitual offender under the Tamil Nadu Habitual Offenders Act,1948, or should have been one against whom an order has been made under Section 110 of Cr.P.C. In all cases a person can be history-sheeted only for two years as provided in PSO 748(1). Retaining a history-sheeter beyond that period is an exception and it must have an objective basis. History-sheet cannot be retained on the ground that the investigation agency had not filed any final report or where the case is pending trial beyond two years. The court said there cannot be any retention under PSO 748 (2), unless a fresh case is registered (which may be either under investigation or pending) subsequent to the case/cases which necessitated opening of the history-sheet or a history-sheeter is notified as a habitual offender.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-issues-directions-to-police-on-opening-history-sheet/article32108240.ece

Vinay and Corporation Commissioner S. Visagan, to set up a makeshift wholesale vegetable market. The district administration closed the market a fortnight ago after many merchants and buyers either tested positive to COVID-19 or showed symptoms of the virus, . The merchants’ associations in Paravai had urged the Collector to reopen the market and promised to adhere to physical distancing norms and cooperate with teams in screening visitors. But officials especially from health department were not willing to reopen the market in view of a bitter experience with the Koyambedu market in Chennai. He told reporters that the State government was ready to keep open the market and allow people to step out. But certain guidelines had been prescribed by experts for exit from the lockdown. ‘We are examining the modalities. The administration is considering them step by step,’ he said. Within a day or two, a new market, an alternative to Paravai market, would be announced, he said.  Minister’s gesture Thilaga, wife of Mohanraj, from Kumarapalayam, Namakkal district, told the minister that she had lost her husband four years ago and sought help. She had to take care of two girls.

17 July 2020||Mayiladuthurai,TAMIL NADU||Mayiladuthurai district all set to take shape||At long last, votaries of Mayiladuthurai district say they are able to look forward to concrete action on the part of the government for bifurcation of Nagapattinam district. Earlier this year, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced creation of the new district while taking part in a function in Nagapattinam district. However, there was an inevitable delay in follow-up action due to the COVID-19 lockdown. The government had indicated that the new district will take shape after lockdown restrictions are lifted. The appointment of two top-level officials for the new district has ushered in joy for the residents in Mayiladuthurai and surrounding taluks, who had to, hitherto, travel for over 70 kilometres to reach the district headquarters at Nagapattinam. Officials of government departments are also equally relieved since the need for them to travel frequently to the district headquarters has been obviated. The formation of the new district is expected to begin with demarcation of boundary by the newly-appointed officials - Special Officer R. Lalitha and Superintendent of Police N. Shreenatha. “The posting of the top-level officials for the new district is a heartening development. We are looking forward for a full-fledged functioning of the district administration at the earliest, C. Senthilvel, president of Mayiladuthurai Chamber of Commerce, said. Hitherto, a revenue division of Nagapattinam district, Mayiladuthurai district will have in its fold Kuthalam, Mayiladuthurai, Sirkazhi and Tranquebar taluks. Known for its famous temples, the town is well connected to various districts in the State by rail and road. The immediate emphasis will be on a new bus stand befitting the district status and a ring road to deal with the burgeoning traffic, R. Seyon, Chief Coordinator, Mayiladuthurai District Advocates' Federation, said. Though Mayiladuthurai was part of Nagapattinam district, the people faced the ignominy of travelling to the headquarters with e-passes since they had to cross any of the two checkposts that of Karaikal district or Tiruvarur district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mayiladuthurai-district-all-set-to-take-shape/article32108583.ece

The plant would process 300 tonnes of feed stock including pressed mud and chicken litter every day to produce 15 tonnes of biogas. This gas was being supplied through five petroleum outlets branded as Indigreen.

17 July 2020||P.A.Narayani,TAMIL NADU||Skeletal remains of two more children excavated at Konthagai||Skeletal remains of two more children were excavated at Konthagai as part of the sixth phase of the excavations in the ancient site of Keeladi. While one of the skeletons was 105 cm in height, the other one measured 65 cm. With the excavation of these two skeletons, the total number of children’s skeletons found at the same trench was five, said Deputy Director of Archaeology and in-charge of the excavations R. Sivanandam. He said a couple of days back, a skeleton of an infant, measuring 35 cm in height, was excavated. The first child was excavated on June 19 and the second one on July 7. An urn was also found near the location from where the skeletons of the five children were excavated, said Mr. Sivanandam. “We have taken photographs and documented these five skeletal remains. They will be sent to Madurai Kamaraj University, where DNA analysis would be undertaken,” he said. The skulls, faces and teeth of the fourth and fifth child were all intact, he said. “But, the skull of the infant, which was fragile, was crushed when we had excavated it,” he added. All the skeletal remains of the children were of primary burial, Mr. Sivanandam said. “Pits have been dug up for their burial. We could identify the pits only for some of the skeletal remains, as the layers have been merged together,” he said. A primary burial referred to the burial of a body without any cremation. A secondary burial was usually when the remains of primary burial were exhumed to rebury them or when a body was cremated and the remains were buried, explained a source from the Archeological Department. “We have also found bodies of adults during the excavation,” said Mr. Sivanandam. The department source said Keeladi was considered the place for primary habitation. “So, the nearby Konthagai village was used as a burial spot. This signifies that they had followed a structured lifestyle,” the source added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/skeletal-remains-of-two-more-children-excavated-at-konthagai/article32108521.ece

The objective of starting the school was to enable the poorest of the poor in the district, who scored above 400 in class 10 examination, join the Elite School. The Collector realised that the students may not be able to afford the exorbitant fee collected in private schools. Hence, he brought in like-minded senior teachers from different government schools to produce the best brains from the district. Toppers from the school have stood up to the expectations of teachers, considering that their family background was not only economically weak, but many of their parents had little knowledge about education, teachers said. Speaking toThe Hindu, Thavaram Kumar, physics teacher, said they were happy with the results. Son of a cab driver in Rameswaram, Athavan topped with 565.

She has passed the Plus Two examination this year, securing 453 marks out of 500. Her wish: To become the first graduate in her family. The road to academic success, however, has not been easy. When her mother Vijayalakshmi fell ill, her family was forced to shift from Chennai to Sivakasi. With the focus on her mother’s treatment, little Arulroja’s education was not a priority. She could not be admitted in school because her parents forgot to get her transfer certificate from Chennai. What is more, she began to lending a helping hand in doing household chores. Two years passed, when K. Ramalakshmi, teacher at National Child Labour Programme (NCLP)special centre, came across the drop-out. The teacher told her parents that she was ready to admit Arulroja at the special centre without a transfer certificate. Both mother and daughter were overjoyed. “We said she could come to school with a delay of one hour every day so that she can assist her mother at home,” Ms. Ramalakshmi said. Arulroja was studious even while pursuing the bridge course. She continued her dominance in high school too, topping her classmates with 435 marks in Class 10. She is once again at the top of a list of 22 students, who, like her, were either child labourers or school dropouts handling domestic chores. With 453 marks in Plus Two examination in her kitty, she wishes to become the first graduate in her family as her elder brother is a school dropout. Arulroja wants to pursue mathematics. “We will help her get educational assistance from NGOs,” Ms. Ramalakshmi said. Twenty of the 22 students have passed Plus Two examination, said NCLP project director Narayanan. P. Ponnupandi has come second with 391 marks followed by P.

17 July 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Salai Road ROB hits a bump||The road over bridge (ROB) near the LA Cinema Maris Theatre complex on Salai Road is unlikely to be opened for traffic in the near future as the recent spell of rains have caused extensive damage to the approach road. Officials said that the approach road suffered extensive damage in Saturday’s rain though it was initially thought that only a small portion had caved in due to sand erosion. Heavy sand erosion was detected along the parapet and the road had caved in to about 50 feet, official sources said. After a field inspection by Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian and City Engineer S. Amuthavalli, barricades were put up across the road. There was no visible damage to the main bridge span, which is maintained by the Southern Railway, but the soil erosion had occurred close to it. The bridge was built in 1866 and strengthened in 1971. Corporation officials have taken up the matter to the notice of the Chief Engineer of the Southern Railway. Collector S. Sivarasu inspected the site on Thursday and held discussion with the Corporation officials on the repair. He is understood to have assured the Corporation officials that the matter will be taken up with the government immediately. Mr. Sivasubramanian told The Hindu that a proposal has already been sent to the State government to transfer the maintenance of Salai Road from the Corporation to the State Highways Department. Unseasonal heavy rain had caused extensive damage to the road when the proposal was under consideration. The heavy damage had warranted a decision on whether to take up temporary restoration or to construct a new ROB, for which the Southern Railway had come forward to bear 50% of the cost. “Traffic can not be allowed on the weakened road. However, considering the importance of the road, temporary restoration work is being carried out to strengthen the road by placing sandbags. About 500 sandbags have been placed so far. After completion of work, the road would be inspected again to study the possibility of allowing traffic. But, there was no chance of opening the road for heavy vehicles,” Mr. Sivasubramanian added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/salai-road-rob-hits-a-bump/article32108576.ece

17 July 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||HC’s observation on rail link restoration referred to Railway Board||The Tiruchi Divisional Office of Southern Railway has forwarded to the Railway Board the observation of the Madras High Court on the Public Interest Litigation filed by Kuthalam P. Kalyanam, former MLA, for restoration of 30-km Mayiladuthurai-Tranquebar rail link that existed during the British period. The High Court had stated that though decision-making was in the administrative domain, “a supervening public interest can be brought to the notice of the government for taking an appropriate decision”, said Mr. Kalyanam. The Southern Railway had marked a copy of the High Court’s observation on the PIL sent to the Railway Board to Mr. Kalyanam. The High Court had expressed its agreement with the petitioner for ‘restoration’ of the 30-km link and had granted liberty to the respondents - the Central Government, Railway Board and GM or Southern Railway and Divisional Railway Manager of Tiruchi Division, to consider the grievance in the background of which it had been raised and to take appropriate decision. Service discontinued in 1985 The rail service in the Mayiladuthurai-Tranquebar link, established in 1926 with stoppages in Dharmapuram, Mannampanthal, Sembanarkoil, Akkur, Thirukadaiyur, Thillayadi and Porayar Railway Stations, was discontinued in 1985 for broad gauge conversion. But, the link, which was a necessity for economic development and progress of agricultural community in delta area, and daily travel of thousands of students and commuters, was not restored though there was no need for acquisition of additional land, Mr. Kalyanam had stated in the PIL. The petitioner had also laid emphasis on extending the link from Tranquebar to nearby Karaikal station which was about 12 km away, citing availability of continuous barren land. The extended link will provide a direct connectivity between Puducherry and Karaikal along the East Coast, Mr. Kalyanam pointed out. Inviting the attention of the Railway Ministry to the opportunity for creating a circular rail route connecting holy destinations of Thirukkadaiyur, Thirunallar, Nagore and Velankanni, symbolising religious harmony, Mr. Kalyanam requested the Southern Railway to do the needful to extend the link from Tranquebar to Karaikal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hcs-observation-on-rail-link-restoration-referred-to-railway-board/article32108584.ece

Several top industries across automobile, pharmaceutical, and food processing, among other sectors, in the State have reported COVID-19 outbreak among their workforce while the infection has affected workers in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) too. Government intervention has helped in a few cases, but in a large number of cases, companies have handled the situation on their own. Range of responses Without a standard operating procedure (SOP) in place, factories have not stuck to a particular sealing norm once the infection is detected on the premises. Therefore, the procedure adopted so far has ranged from factory premises being sealed for just one day for sanitisation to as many as 21 days.President of the Karnataka Employer’s Association B.C. Prabhakar acknowledged that there are no standards in sealing norms, and each employer has been handling the situation on his/her own. He further argued that a common operating procedure would not suit all sectors. “We may require different SOPs for different industries. However, employees have also started pointing at different industries and questioning the management over handling of the situation,” he said. Barring a few big companies, experience so far suggests that workers who have contracted the virus in the workplace or have become primary contacts have been asked to go on leave or take loss of pay if they do not have adequate leave. ESI and non-ESI Currently, only workers covered by the ESI — where workers’ monthly gross fixed salary is less than Rs. 21,000 — get 28 days leave, which can be used only if they are COVID-19 positive. His/her primary contacts who also require quarantine do not qualify for this leave. The problem for non-ESI workers is that not all workers get sick leave, as it is not prescribed under the Factories Act, and is only negotiated with managements. “Unfortunately, in many companies, the workers’ leaves have been adjusted for the phase one lockdown period and workers are not left with many leaves,” said D.A. Vijaybhaskar, general secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress. “Workers are attending duty under great stress and are scared for their lives,” Trade Union Coordination Centre general secretary G.R. Shivashankar said. While in some big companies adequate precautions are being taken, in most companies there is not much precaution, he claimed. He also said that regular leaves are being adjusted against sick leave arising out of COVID-19 or for being a primary contact of a positive person. Mr. Prabhakar also acknowledged that a sizeable workforce has not resumed work citing COVID-19 threat and also under pressure from families not to attend work over safety issues.  Though “quarantine leave” is an issue, the cause of bigger worry has been the insurance cover for the workers vulnerable at work place, which ranges from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 3 lakh in a majority of cases, and in few cases up to Rs. 5 lakh. “Families have not been covered. Only now some companies are waking up to the situation,” Mr. Vijaybhaskar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-with-no-sop-factories-adopt-different-norms/article32108178.ece
17 July 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State’s MMR ranking up to 9th from 11th||Karnataka’s Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) declined by five points from 97 per one lakh live births in 2015-17 to 92 per one lakh live births in 2016-18. In 2014-2016, the MMR was 108. The MMR is a significant indicator that defines the public health of a State. It determines the progress made in saving the lives of pregnant women during pregnancy, childbirth and lactation. However, Karnataka’s MMR continues to be the highest among the five southern States. It is also the only State among the five to have seen a 5.2% decline in MMR, indicating that the number of women dying during childbirth has come down significantly, according to the latest Sample Registration System 2016-18 bulletin for MMR released by the Registrar-General of India on Thursday. Although the decline this time is half of what the State recorded in 2015-17, Karnataka’s ranking has improved from 11th to 9th position in the country. While Kerala tops the list with the lowest MMR — 43 per one lakh live births — despite recording an increase in the ratio from 42 in 2015-2017, Assam has the highest at 215. While Telangana has recorded the highest decrease in MMR, from 76 in 2015-17 to 63 in 2016-18, Chhattisgarh has recorded the highest increase, from 141 in 2015-17 to 159 in 2016-18. In fact, the MMR has increased in five States — Kerala, West Bengal, Punjab, Uttarakhand, and Chhattisgarh. Attributing the decline in MMR to the collective efforts of health workers who have created awareness on institutional deliveries, Rajkumar N., State Deputy Director (Maternal Health), told The Hindu that Karnataka was one of seven States to have achieved the national goal of an MMR lower than 100. “We are now aiming to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of an MMR of less than 70 by 2030,” he said. Admitting that the State was facing challenges in providing maternal and child health services, Dr. Rajkumar said efforts were being made to address the lack of availability of specialists — obstetricians, paediatricians, and anaesthetists — at government hospitals in rural areas. Northern districts Maternal mortalityis high in some districts in Karnataka such as Kalaburagi, Raichur, Gadag, Koppal, Yadgir, Bidar, Vijayapura, Bagalkot, Ballari, Davangere, and Shivamogga. “This is mainly because of the poor health-seeking behaviour among the people there. We are working on increasing institutional deliveries through intensified awareness campaigns,” he said. “Besides, implementation of the LaQshya programme — aimed at improving the quality of labour and operation theatre services, thereby contributing to reduction of maternal deaths — has been taken up in 124 hospitals,” Dr.Rajkumar added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/states-mmr-ranking-up-to-9th-from-11th/article32108193.ece
17 July 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Pandemic weighs heavily on patients with rare diseases||It was February when Deputy Superintendent of Police Mahadev Maruthi Yadawad managed to procure an imported drug for his three-and-a-half-month-old baby to treat his seizures. A colleague who was in Bengaluru helped deliver it to Kalaburagi, where Mr. Yadawad lives. Little did he know that his child would soon be left with no medicine once the lockdown came into effect. Life was already tough for patients with rare diseases. Few were aware of what ailed them, treatment was not available everywhere, and where it was available it was incredibly expensive. As the fight for adequate care yielded results, some governments, such as the one in Karnataka, stepped in to help. But since the lockdown, uncertaintyhas set in again. Some patients have run out of medicines and are forced to get stop-gap treatments from doctors. In other cases, where hospital visits are common, fear of the virus coupled with failure to get treatment has come as a double-edged sword. In Mr. Yadawad’s case, he got lucky twice. But that relief ended soon. “My son gets myoclonic jerks. There is an imported tablet that stops it. I live in Kalaburagi and it is not available here. We managed to learn about a pharmacy in Bengaluru and a colleague brought it for us. Then the lockdown came into effect and the Bengaluru pharmacy ran out of stock,” he said. After an intensive search, they found a pharmacy in Hyderabad with some stock left. The drug made it to his hands in a goods vehicle to Raichur and then to Kalaburagi. They eventually ran out of it as well. “The spasms are continuing now. They come some 30 to 40 times a day. We contacted a doctor in Bengaluru, who has given us a temporary arrangement now,” he said. Panicked parents Paediatric neurologist Ann Agnes Mathew said it was difficult to see children, who were getting better with treatment, suddenly lose access to medicines. “Parents call us in panic, asking us what is going to happen. It is heartbreaking. For example, there is a particular medicine that stops seizures. A particular rare type of epilepsy that happens to children under the age of two, and 50% of them do badly. Locally, it is known as the salaam attack. It is a powerful and rare form of epilepsy. Itis called the West syndrome and is caused by many different factors. Babies are not capable of dealing with it. There are only two drugs for it — steroids or this medicine. Many children respond only to the medicine, which is not available in India,” she said, adding that an adult seizure wasnot life-threatening. There are several such rare diseases, such as haemophilia, thalassemia, sickle cell anaemia and primary immunodeficiencies, auto-immune diseases, Pompe disease, Hirschsprung’s disease, Gaucher’s disease, cystic fibrosis, and forms of muscular dystrophy. Prasanna Kumar B. Shirol, co-founder of the Organisation for Rare Diseases India and parent to a child with a rare disease, said that apart from drugs going out of stock, physiotherapy that most such children undergo has also stopped since the pandemic arrived. “It has also been difficult for caregivers,” he said. But he pointed out that patients in Karnataka were slightly better off. “Enzyme replacement therapy has not stopped in Karnataka fortunately, unlike in other States.Otherwise, we would be going back a few steps if we missed one dosage. We are also lucky to have an exclusive ward — Centre of Excellence for Rare Diseases at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health — in Bengaluru. So those who need life-saving drugs can betaken here, though there is fear,” he said.  There is a rare and powerful form of epilepsy called the West syndrome. There are only two drugs for it — steroids or this medicine.

17 July 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Their wait for answer scripts from KPSC continues||Over six months after candidates of the 2015 gazetted probationers examination conducted by the Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC) sought a copy of their evaluated answer scripts, they are yet to receive them. This is despite the Karnataka Information Commission directing the KPSC to provide the answer scripts to the candidates. Candidates who did not make it to the final list that was announced in January 2020 have been seeking their evaluated answer scripts from the commission, which has in the past given copies under the Right to Information Act, 2005. However, taking shelter under a 2018 Supreme Court direction, the information officials in the KPSC have been rejecting the applications, said a candidate. The KPSC took the matter to the High Court of Karnataka for adjudication after the Information Commissioner directed it to share the scripts under the RTI.  Siddaramaiah’s letter Now, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah has sought Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s intervention on the matter. In a letter to the BJP leader, he pointed out, “The RTI Commissioner has directed the KPSC to provide evaluated answer scripts to the candidates.Despite these orders, candidates are unnecessarily being made to run around courts. The candidates, after years of preparation, appeared for the exam, and they have the right to see their evaluated answer scripts.”The KPSC conducted the 2015 gazetted probationers exam to fill 428 posts from August 2017 and released the final list of selected candidates in January this year. The commission had, under the RTI provisions, provided evaluated answer scripts of the main exam to candidates in the 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2015 gazetted probationers batches. Mr. Siddaramaiah said the KPSC has been rejecting the RTI applications from candidates citing the 2018 apex court order that pertained to a preliminary exam conducted by the Union Public Service Commission in 2010. The court, however, in subsequent directions to the Public Service Commission in Uttar Pradesh and also the Institute of Company Secretaries of India, ensured the evaluated answer scripts were sent to candidates under the RTI, the Congress leader pointed out. The former Chief Minister also quoted the top court’s order on an SLP filed by Aditya Bandopadhya and others against the Central Board of Secondary Education on the definition of information and how the evaluated answer script that contained the “opinion of the examiner” was “information” under the RTI Act. KPSC Secretary G. Sathyavathi was not available for comment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/their-wait-for-answer-scripts-from-kpsc-continues/article32108170.ece
17 July 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC appoints senior IAS officer to enforce SOP in containment zones||Recording that the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has failed in its obligation to effectively enforce the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to manage the containment zones, the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday appointed a senior IAS officer to supervise enforcement of SOP in around 5,500 such zones in the city. The court directed G. Kumar Naik, Principal Secretary, Social Welfare Department, whose name was suggested by the State government, to issue necessary directions to the commissioner and other officials of the BBMP to ensure enforcement of the SOP. A special Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Alok Aradhe issued the directions while hearing PIL petitions related to COVID-19 restrictions. Mr. Naik has to submit a report to the court on July 24. The Bench noted that the BBMP did not take any step despite an assurance given by its commissioner, who was earlier summoned to the court on lapses in SOP enforcement. ‘Fit case to prosecute officials for contempt’ Observing that it is a fit case where top officials of the BBMP should be prosecuted for contempt of court, the Bench said it was not taking action, since no purpose would be served in sending officials to prison as enforcement of SOP is more important. Stating that it is a classic case for superseding the BBMP as per Section 99 of the Karnataka Municipal Corporation Act for failure to discharge its obligations, the Bench said it was not going to that extent considering the pandemic and the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases. “We are conscious of the fact that machineries of the State government and the BBMP are working under pressure at the present situation. However, the need of the hour is an earnest effort to ensure effective implementation of SOP in CZs to prevent spread of COVID-19,” the Bench observed while pointing out that none of the affidavits filed by BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar indicate that there is any desire to comply with the SOP. Though BBMP on Thursday withdrew its earlier statement that movement of people in and out of containment zone is not strictly prohibited, the Bench found that the BBMP’s affidavit is silent on complete sealing of CZs and that it will strictly enforce norms of SOP in CZs. Also, the Bench noted that the BBMP till today has failed to identify persons needy of food packets or ration kits in CZs even though SOP specifically prescribe such a measure. Meanwhile, the Bench said the BBMP cannot insist on production of documents by persons in need of food but documents can be insisted only for creating record for supplying ration kits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-appoints-senior-ias-officer-to-enforce-sop-in-containment-zones/article32108158.ece

The 76-year-old resident of Vasant Nagar died on Sunday. However, the COVID-19 test result arrived on Thursday morning. The body was kept in a morgue during the intervening period and handed over to the family on Thursday morning. When family members took the body to the cemetery, nearby residents objected arguing that the burial ground was in the midst of a densely populated residential area and that it was not safe for them. As tensions rose, some residents brought an earthmover and blocked the entrance to the cemetery, and the police had to intervene. “Family members voluntarily agreed to conduct the last rites in another cemetery and left the place,” a senior official of Vidyaranyapura police station said.

Ashok on Thursday said there was no need for any hospital in Bengaluru to seek either a report on COVID-19 or the official code number from the authorities concerned to admit patients. The Minister told reporters in Bengaluru that the hospitals could admit anyone who comes to them seeking emergency medical response without such reports. “They can conduct COVID-19 test after admitting the patient. If the patient tests positive, he can be shifted to the COVID-19 ward. Otherwise, they can treat them in the non-COVID wing,” he said. Pointing out that hospitals attend to accident victims without waiting for any report from the authorities, he said they should follow a similar procedure with respect to COVID-19 patients.  Mr. Ashok, who held a meeting of leaders and elected representatives from South zone of Bengaluru city on COVID-19 management, expressed concern over reports that some nurses were skipping work. He sought to remind them that it was obligatory on their part to attend to work related to COVID-19. He warned that measures would be taken to identify those skipping work and action initiated against them. He also said all doctors and other health staff had to undergo a one-week quarantine after a week of work. The government will arrange for their quarantine in nearby hotels, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/admit-patients-and-then-test-for-covid-19-ashok/article32108188.ece

17 July 2020||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Subhadramma Mansur dead||Subhadramma Mansur, a Ballari-based senior theatre artiste, died of heart attack in Ballari late night on Wednesday. She was 81. Born in 1939 in Ballari to Jwalapathi, a mechanic and harmonium player, and Bhagyamma, a singer, Subhadramma lost her father at an early age. After completing six years of formal education, she dropped out of school at the age of 12 owing to the poor financial condition of the family. She then joined a theatre company as a child artiste. In 1952, when she was just 13 years old, she married Lingaraj Mansur, another well-known theatre artiste who was 36 years old then. Subhadramma began learning classical music from her teacher Chandrashekhar Gawai at the age of 25 and achieved considerable command over it.

17 July 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Nearly 3.75 lakh workers tap their retirement savings in Bengaluru||Nearly 3.75 lakh workers with the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) account in Bengaluru zone have sought COVID-19 advance, underlining the extent of financial and unemployment crisis owing to the pandemic. The Union government introduced a provision for a special withdrawal from the EPF scheme for subscribers to tide over the financial crisis arising out of pay cuts and job loss owing to the outbreak of COVID-19. This special provision entails a withdrawal of three months of basic plus DA or 75% of the balance in the EPF account, whichever is less. This is non-returnable and hence there is no burden on the employees to repay the amount with interest as in case of a loan. There are 35,41,509 EPF subscribers in Bengaluru zone covering the entire urban conglomerate of whom 3,74,499 employees had raised claims for a one-time advance to deal with financial crisis. This is more than 10% of the workforce who are subscribers of the EPFO in Bengaluru and the numbers are on the rise. The figures are as of July 7 and 2,66,212 claims have been settled (as on that date) in respect of Bengaluru zone, according to R.K. Singh, Additional Central Provident Fund Commissioner, zonal office, Bengaluru. In an email reply to The Hindu , he said that as of July 7, the organisation has disbursed in excess of Rs. 1,007.35 crore for Bengaluru zone as COVID-19 advance. He said in respect of the Hubballi zone, 45,412 claims had been settled as of July 7 and Rs. 121.84 crore was disbursed while across Karnataka, the EPFO offices had settled 3,11,624 claims and disbursed Rs. 1,129.205 crore. Sudhakar Shetty, former president of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said workers withdrawing their EPF savings is a testimony to the closure of many industries or establishments trimming their workforce which has resulted in job loss. “This is only the tip of the iceberg because a majority of the workforce is out of EPF and engaged in daily, casual or contract labour and lack provident facilities,” he added. It is reckoned that bulk of the withdrawal is by employees in the private sector who have taken a pay cut or on furlough and in many cases have been rendered unemployed. With no sight of the flattening of the curve and intermittent lockdowns being announced by the local authorities, the uncertainty in the economic sector and the cascading impact on jobs are bound to continue till the pandemic subsides, said Mr. Shetty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nearly-375-lakh-workers-tap-their-retirement-savings-in-bengaluru/article32108173.ece

17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||3 marshals fired for caning citizens||With agencies like the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the police roping in volunteers to help them enforce rules, such as social distancing and curfew, residents are worried that it will lead to vigilantism. Three civic marshals were fired on June 15 after a video of them caning and punishing two people in K.R. Market, to enforce the lockdown, went viral. An ex-serviceman and two NCC cadets – Deepak, Pavan and Dinesh Nayak – were posted at K.R. Market that has been sealed due to the pandemic. One of them recorded a video of his colleagues caning the two men. They were made to kneel and walk on their knees. The clip was uploaded on social media, as a sort of warning for violators, said officials. “The video was brought to our notice. Upon inquiry, it has come to light that the two men had also manhandled marshals. Marshals are authorised to levy penalty, but not to enforce rules through other means. They should have informed the police. We fired them,” said Col. Rajbir Singh, Chief Marshal, BBMP. He added their mandate was very clear, and did not warrant them enforcing orders by force. Similar instances of vigilantism had been reported during the first phase of the lockdown when the city police had informally roped in citizen volunteers to monitor barricades. The system is currently being formalised where volunteers will be known as civil police wardens. In the initial period, there were several complaints against the high-handed behaviour by volunteers when they got into verbal altercations and abused citizens in the presence of police personnel. There were also complaints of communal prejudice where members of minority communities were blamed for the spread of the virus. “The problem is that when we call for volunteers, the ones who usually join are political workers of the local councillor or MLAs,” said a senior police official. “This time, too, the people, who are keen to join, are no different,” he added. Senior advocate B.T. Venkatesh said while the city appreciates the work the police are doing in a public health crisis and understands the need for volunteers, any excesses by ‘civil police wardens’ should not be allowed. “Their role has to be clearly defined and restricted to only helping the police and not become enforcers themselves. They should not be armed with even lathis under any circumstances. They are neither authorised nor trained for the purpose,” he said, adding that vetting the credentials of those who volunteer was an important part of the process. Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao told The Hindu that the role of the wardens was clearly defined and restricted. “They will not be armed, and will only be deployed for soft duties, like paperwork, at help desks in police stations and at the barricades with police personnel. They will always be supervised by our personnel, and care will be taken to ensure there are no excesses,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/3-marshals-fired-for-caning-citizens/article32108168.ece
17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||HC: Is random testing of frontline warriors possible?||Expressing concern over death of police personnel, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike officials and pourakarmikas due to COVID-19, the Karnataka High Court on Thursday asked the State government whether it is possible to conduct random tests of personnel working in the frontline to prevent spread of COVID-19. Though the government and the experts will have to take a call on random testing, the court said that it expects special care to protect the lives of pourakarmikas, police, doctors, healthcare workers, BBMP staff and others working working on the frontline. A special division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Alok Aradhe made these observations while hearing PIL petitions on lapses in COVID-19 health management. Earlier, it was pointed out to the court by advocates representing petitioners that 23 pourakarmikas working in a particular ward tested positive for COVID-19 and one pourakarmika in another ward died due to non availability of beds in a hospital. Also, a few police personnel and officials of the BBMP too have succumbed to COVID-19. “If pourakarmikas, who serve the BBMP, are unable to get a bed for treatment, who else will get a bed?” the bench observed orally. It was also pointed out to the court that the health of pourakarmikas is at risk with the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases as almost all wards have containment zones. Noticing that there are more than 5,000 containment zones in the city, and waste collected from the houses in these zones will have to be be treated not as municipal solid waste but biomedical waste, the bench asked the government and the BBMP to ensure that proper personal protective equipment, as per the SOP, is provided to pourakarmikas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-is-random-testing-of-frontline-warriors-possible/article32108160.ece
17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Students indulging in malpractices during online exams||Many educational institutions and testing agencies that are conducting examinations online are finding that students are taking advantage of the system to indulge in malpractice. While some institutions are debarring guilty students from examinations, others are opting for a fine and a warning. Fr. Abraham V., vice-chancellor, Christ (Deemed to be University) which is conducting online examination, said that they have roped in a third party agency to conduct the examination. “Students can switch on the camera, take a pen and paper test, and upload answer-scripts on the portal. Or, they can type the answers on their laptops. In either case, their faces should be seen on the screen,” he said. The moment students switch off the video, move away from the screen or try to minimise the screen, they are called out by invigilators monitoring them. The results of as many as 13 final-year students, who appeared for the examinations in June, were cancelled. “Their marks have have been withheld,” he added. Sarasu Esther Thomas, Registrar, National Law School of India University, Bengaluru said that the university conducted an online open book examination in June. For a three-hour paper, students were given either six or eight hours to type their answers and send it to their professors. “The extra time was given keeping in mind the challenges that some students may face due to poor internet connectivity,” she said. Answer-scripts are bar-coded to prevent a teacher from knowing the identity of candidates. The examination department downloads the papers and runs them through a similarity software. “If two students have used similar words or answers, they are marked zero for that paper,” said Ms. Thomas, adding that action taken against students was based on the extent to which their answers were similar. Examinations for NLSIU’s distance education programme will begin next week. The university will use a remote exam proctoring software. Candidates can appear for the examination using a pen and paper. They can upload their answer-scripts or can write the answers on a computer and submit them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/students-indulging-in-malpractices-during-online-exams/article32108166.ece

One of them returned to Alappuzha from Kuwait a few weeks ago for the sole purpose of appearing for KEAM 2020-21, the State entrance examinations for admission to engineering and pharmacy courses. Three days ago he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Alappuzha, for treatment. “Testing COVID-19 positive just before the entrance examinations was a shock to me.

Sunil Kumar, the MP said that all people in wards 15, 16 and 17 in Chellanam should be tested for COVID-19. A full-time facility should be established for collecting samples. The number of tests should be increased from 40 to 60 and sufficient COVID first-line treatment centres should be opened, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/51-contract-covid-19-through-local-transmission-in-ernakulam/article32108432.ece
17 July 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Housing project put in cold storage||Nearly three years after work began and seven years after a detailed project report was prepared, the Kochi Corporation has been unable to offer homes promised to 398 landless people of Thuruthy, Kalvathy, and Koncheri in West Kochi. The two 12-storey towers that were conceived under the then UPA government’s Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) scheme remain entangled in procedural delays. The contractor began work on the first tower in 2017 and was expected to complete it by February 2019, but essentials like plumbing and electrification had been omitted from the cost estimate. After a long delay and squabbles at the corporation council over whether or not the existing contractor’s agreement must be extended, the council decided to allow the contractor to finish work as per the initial agreement. But the revised estimate had not been placed before the council yet, said Mayor Soumini Jain. In the absence of a supplementary agreement and the non-payment of nearly Rs. 1.5 crore of dues owed to him, the contractor went to court, said sources associated with the project. A High Court order issued last month required the corporation council to take a decision within one month on approving the revised estimate for the project and executing another agreement with the contractor. Hopes dashed “When the project was launched, we had hopes of having a house where we would not have to pay thousands of rupees as rent every month. We have exhausted ourselves running after its implementation and no longer know whom to approach to ensure it gets done,” said Sheeja, a seamstress and resident of Thuruthy. “The project appears to have been stalled by bickering along political lines and the beneficiaries are caught in the mess,” she said. “Even once the current contractor begins work, he can only complete structural work on about six floors of the building as per the estimate of Rs. 18 crore,” sources said. The corporation will have to re-tender the rest of the work, further delaying the project. To finish it entirely, the project would cost around Rs. 39 crore. Meanwhile, the construction of the second RAY tower for 199 families, at a cost of Rs. 46 crore, adjacent to the first one at Kalvathy also appears to have been stalled. The corporation council had in January approved a decision to hand over the construction of the second tower to Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML). But with only a single bidder responding to the first tender invite, a second attempt at tendering the work would be made this week, CSML sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/housing-project-put-in-cold-storage/article32108438.ece
17 July 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Govt. nod for mortgaging land to raise fund for WTE plant||The government has permitted the firm to be chosen for the execution of the centralised waste-to-energy plant on 20 acres in Brahmapuram to mortgage the leasehold rights on the land for raising funds for the project. The Secretary of the Kochi Corporation has been asked to hand over the 20 acres to the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) on lease basis. The government agency will sub lease the land to the firm short-listed for 27 years after due bidding process, with permission to mortgage the leasehold rights on the land for raising funds for the project only, according to the order issued by the Local-Self Government Department. The KSIDC had invited tenders on June 24 for setting up an integrated solid waste management project with a waste-to-energy plant of 300 tonnes per day capacity on design, build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT) basis under the public-private partnership mode at Brahmapuram for the Ernakulam cluster of local bodies. Move questioned Reacting to the development, lawyer and environmental activist Harish Vasudevan pointed out that the firm would have nothing to lose if it exited the project midway as it had raised the investment by mortgaging government land. “Why should the government permit the company to mortgage the leasehold rights and also pay up for the higher tariff fixed for the electricity generated from the plant,” he asked. On the ‘Swiss model’ of tendering, Mr. Vasudevan wondered whether Switzerland or European nations would permit companies to mortgage government land for such projects. Fresh tenders The decision to float fresh tenders for the project was taken after the government cancelled the approval granted to GJ Nature Care consortium for setting up a waste-to-energy project at Brahmapuram on April 30. The Kochi Corporation had signed an agreement with the firm for implementing the project under DBFOT basis on February 17, 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-nod-for-mortgaging-land-to-raise-fund-for-wte-plant/article32108434.ece

The petition was filed by Micheal Varghese of Alappuzha. According to him, the police was duty bound to set the criminal law in motion by filing an FIR, on their own, as public servants were allegedly involved in the case.

The administration is also planning to set up more first-line treatment centres (FLTC) to treat asymptomatic persons and those with mild symptoms. In a release on Thursday, the department issued guidelines for the people which include restrictions on venturing out of their homes and travel to other places. District Medical Officer V. Jayasree said that crowding of people should be avoided. Pregnant women, children, and senior citizens should remain at home. Wearing of face masks completely covering the nose and mouth is a must at public places and in offices, along with washing of hands. Social distancing norms should be followed at market places and where people visit in large numbers. Children and the youth should avoid engaging in games and other activities in public places. Nobody other than volunteers and personnel engaged in emergency services should go out for work. Dr. Jayasree said that declaration of containment zones was a temporary step to stop the infection spreading to more people in areas where many patients have been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. She urged the people to reduce human interaction to a minimum in such areas, including visits to the houses of neighbours and relatives. Meanwhile, the district administration directed local bodies to identify buildings where more FLTCs could be set up. Right now, only two FLTCs, one at the Lakshadweep guest house in the city and the other at the National Institute of Technology-Calicut hostel at Chathamangalam, are functioning within the district. However, more number of cases, especially those through local transmission, are now being reported from Vadakara and nearby areas. A release said that the buildings identified should be converted as treatment centres within a 48-hour notice. They can accommodate up to 5,000 persons. The articles needed there will be collected from the public. Those who wish to contribute should call 9745121244.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/alert-issued-in-kozhikode-more-fltcs-to-be-set-up/article32108428.ece

Living in rented quarters at Kottakkal, Jayasurya used to join his mother Govindamma in her scrap collection outings. But she insisted that he focus on his studies as he grew up. “I couldn’t simply watch my mother struggling hard to make a living. So I started going for construction work whenever I got time,” he said. His father Raja Kannan has been bedridden after a road accident several years ago.

As many as 339 people, including five health workers, were diagnosed with the disease, taking the district’s active COVID-19 tally to 1,279. Only one person recovered from the disease on the day. According to official statistics, 317 people contracted the infection through local transmission and among them, the sources of infection of 16 cases are unknown. 78 staff of hypermarket Sparking a new wave of panic in the State capital, 78 employees of Ramachandran hypermarket tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the past two days. The patients are among the 172 employees in the establishment. The results of more swab samples are awaited. The employees, mostly from Tamil Nadu, were reportedly accommodated in a cramped facility on Kochar Road, Thakaraparambu.The Thiruvananthapuram Corporation ordered the closure of the hypermarket and its other branches in the city for a week. CM calls for caution During his briefing, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan pointed out that many other commercial outlets in the State capital also employed migrant workers in large numbers and urged caution in this regard. Critical of the manner in which shops have been functioning, Mr. Vijayan said the particular outlet threw caution to the wind, while their customers “took home the products they purchased as well as the coronavirus.” Hinting at enforcing further curbs, he added that the experience called for reorienting containment efforts. He also urged the customers of the outlet to contact district authorities, especially if they exhibited any symptoms. While several new cases were reported in critical areas, including Poonthura, Pulluvila, Karumkulam, Parassala, Kottappuram and Perumathura with some developing as major clusters, the day also witnessed the emergence of many cases without known sources of infection in places, including Peyad, Ookkode, Pettah, Karikkakom, Konchiravila, Pangode, Muttathara, Kattakada, Kalliyoor and Thycaud.The imported cases include people who came from Saudi Arabia, Oman, UAE and Tamil Nadu recently. Containment zones The number of containment zones also continued to increase in view of the emergence of new cases, many being without any known source of infection. Restrictions have been imposed in Kunnathukal grama panchayat; Kottaramthuruthu ward in Azhoor grama panchayat; Kadakampally ward in Thiruvananthapuram Corporation; Pozhiyoor, Poyppallivilakam, Kollamkodu, Mullassery, Paruthiyoor and Pozhikkara beach wards in Kulathoor grama panchayat; Sarkara, Chirayinkeezhu and Valiyakada wards in Chirayinkeezhu grama panchayat; Kodankara ward in Chenkal grama panchayat; Vadakkeputhuveedu, Plamootukada, Ayira and Kanthalloor wards in Karode grama panchayat; Poovar Bund, Poovar Town, Poovar, Varavilathoppu, Beach and Erikkaluvila wards in Poovar grama panchayat; Palkulangara, Alathoor, Thrippalavoor, Aruvikkara, Marayamuttom and Ayiroor wards in Perumkadavila grama panchayat; and Alamukku, Poovachal, Kattakada Market, Pulinkodu and Thottampara wards in Poovachal grama panchayats. At Greenfield stadium The district administration’s efforts to establish a COVID-19 first-line treatment centre (CFLTC) at the Greenfield stadium in Karyavattom, its allied complex and convention centre are nearing completion. The centre is being equipped with 750 beds and modern medical equipment. The services of doctors, nurses, paramedical and cleaning staff and sanitary workers and ambulances will be made available round-the-clock.

17 July 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Markets, trading centres emerge infection hubs||COVID-19 transmission in the community has become intense in the State, following a global pattern with supermarkets, trading centres, and even hospitals becoming amplifying zones of infection. While the Health Department has identified 84 COVID clusters across the State, disease transmission could be happening silently in other parts of the State, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Thursday. All public places where people are likely to gather in large numbers should be considered as high-risk zones and every other person, a potential source of COVID-19. He said in this stage, all-out efforts would be made to keep mortality down. The State could keep down the number of COVID deaths per million at less than one. However, given the high density of population, as disease transmission goes up, mortality too would and, hence, there should be no let-up in guard. He said with the case numbers swelling, COVID containment should now emerge as a huge people’s movement, with local-self governments taking the lead to create first-line treatment facilities in every panchayat. Mr. Vijayan said the involvement of the private health sector was being sought actively by the government and that all small and medium private hospitals could become first-line treatment centres. He urged the public to maintain physical distancing on Karkidaka Vavu day on Monday. He said lakhs of devotees offered “Vavu Bali” on the religiously important day. However, large crowds increased the risk of mass spread of coronavirus multi-fold. Mr Vijayan urged the people to restrain themselves from congregating voluntarily. Mr. Vijayan said only modern medicine was effective against COVID-19. People should desist from treating the disease via traditional streams of medicine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/markets-trading-centres-emerge-infection-hubs/article32108448.ece
17 July 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||85% candidates appear for entrance exam||Nearly a lakh candidates appeared for the State’s entrance examination for admissions to engineering and pharmacy courses, KEAM 2020, which was held with stringent adherence to the COVID-19 protocol across the State, Mumbai, New Delhi, and Dubai on Thursday. The exam was initially scheduled for April 20 and 21, but was postponed in view of the COVID-induced adverse situation in the State. According to the Commissioner for Entrance Examinations (CEE) A. Geetha, close to 85% of the 1,04,223 candidates who downloaded their hall-tickets appeared for the examination. A total of 1,10,250 had registered for KEAM 2020. Among the centres outside the State, 206 students (out of 376 who downloaded the hall ticket) appeared from New Delhi, 69 (out of 174) from Mumbai and 311 (out of 334) from Dubai. Probably for the first time in the State, two government-run hospitals turned examination centres and health workers became invigilators as three COVID-19 patients also wrote the examination in Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta. While two students were permitted to appear for the examination at the Government Medical College Hospital in Alappuzha on Wednesday, a last-minute plea made by another being treated in the Pathanamthitta General Hospital shortly before the examination was accepted. Sizeable deployments of police personnel and the government’s Samoohika Sannadha Sena volunteers were seen preventing crowding outside the venues. The mask-clad candidates were subjected to temperature screening using thermal scanners. Besides pens, pencils, and clip boards, they were advised to bring their own food and water, considering the closure of restaurants in many places. Separate centre In a last-minute move, the CEE arranged a separate examination centre in St. Antony’s Higher Secondary School, Valiathura, for the benefit of 60-odd candidates who hail from the critical containment zones, comprising the Poonthura, Manikyavilakom and Puthenpally wards, in the State capital. The candidates were relieved as the curtains came down on the examination. “We would have hoped to have taken the examination at a more opportune moment. But given the circumstances, we had no other choice,” Sandhya Viswan, a Vazhuthacaud native, said. After 14 days The first paper (Physics and Chemistry) was held in the morning followed by the second paper (Mathematics). Ms. Geetha said the answer booklets that have been stored in sealed covers will remain untouched for 14 days, following which the evaluation process will be undertaken. The answer keys to the papers are likely to be published on Friday. The announcement of the result could take over a month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/85-candidates-appear-for-entrance-exam/article32108456.ece
17 July 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Capital MCH becomes virus amplifying zone||The Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Thiruvananthapuram, the designated tertiary care COVID hospital for the district, has emerged as a COVID amplifying zone with several doctors, health care workers contracting the infection from patients coming in for general medical care, while at the same time, cross infection could also be resulting in many patients going back with COVID infection from the hospital. On Thursday, around 30 postgraduate residents in General Surgery Department were forced to go on quarantine after three of their PG colleagues and two house surgeons tested positive for COVID-19. MCH doctors said that even when the hospital has a separate COVID OP for patients who are coming for general care from high-risk/containment zones, with intense disease transmission in the community, this separation hardly mattered now. There could be any number of asymptomatic COVID cases among the general patients who would be bringing infection inadvertently into the hospital. Health workers who contract the disease from these patients could similarly be spreading the infection elsewhere to other patients in the hospital. In fact, this is exactly what seems to have happened now. Sources said that last week, a patient who had been recuperating after surgery (all patients undergo COVID test now prior to surgery) in ward 19 tested positive for COVID-19 after the 10th day or so. “This had to be a hospital-acquired infection, probably carried to other patients by junior doctors, because two more patients in the opposite ward, ward 18, then tested positive. Now we have five doctors in the Surgery department who are positive and an entire work force of PGs gone on quarantine,” sources told The Hindu . More precautions While hospitals becoming disease transmission zones during the pandemic has been reported globally, as the designated COVID hospital, more precautions should have been there to prevent general patients and visitors to the hospital from acquiring infection or bringing infection in, many doctors feel. A lot of civil works are currently on in the MCH, which has also resulted in additional crowding and space constraints, all of which could be heightening the existing risk. In fact, MCHs should never have been made COVID hospitals at all because the risks posed to non-COVID patients was too much, which was now becoming very evident, doctors said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/capital-mch-becomes-virus-amplifying-zone/article32108488.ece

Sreeramakrishnan from his office. Indian Union Muslim League leader M. Ummer had submitted the notice to the Legislative Secretary 14 days before the commencement of the Assembly as mandated by the law. Mr. Ummer said in the notice that the Speaker had lowered the esteem of the Assembly by personally associating with Swapna Suresh, the second accused in the high-profile case relating to the smuggling of gold via the diplomatic channel of the UAE consulate. He had inaugurated the car workshop of another accused in the case. The NIA has booked the accused on suspicion of having used the proceeds of the smuggling operation to finance terrorist activities. The case against the accused had elements of treason. Mr. Sreeramakrishnan’s personal relationship with the suspects had brought disrepute to the Assembly. Hence, he should vacate his office. The move to introduce the resolution is the latest bid by the UDF to make a political issue out of the scandal by attempting to link it to the Speaker and the Chief Minister’s Office. Street agitation Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran said that the Congress had cancelled its street agitation in deference to the High Court order that stressed the need to avoid assemblies until the pandemic situation improved.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/udf-moves-against-speaker/article32108449.ece

Besides, the project to be executed by Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd at a cost Rs. 63,941 crore will aggravate economic and environmental problems faced by the State. ‘Double existing tracks’ Instead of going ahead with the Silver Line standard gauge project, A.P. Muralidharan and K. Radhan, KSSP president and general secretary respectively, said the State should push for doubling of the existing rail tracks and electronic signalling for the rail network. The standard gauge mooted for Silver Line in view of the saturated broad gauge line will not benefit long-distance commuters and goods movement. The KSSP has said the move to introduce technology not available in the State as the concept of modern development is aimed at misleading the people. The priority and the need of the State at present are environmental friendly projects that benefit maximum number of citizens and with less investment. Unfortunately, there is no move to double the existing line and introduce electronic signalling and this is suspicious, they said. Completion of the doubling works and electronic signalling system and introduction of mainline electric multiple units to link cities and towns will solve the bulk of the transportation problems being faced by the State, they said. Of the Rs. 63,941 crore needed, 52% has to be mobilised through loans and the State and the Centre will have to bear the balance. The KSSP is of the view that the State’s financial situation will turn worse if the project is executed. The KSSP expressed concern over the environmental issues as huge quantities of granite and earth will have to be mobilised. It asked the government to make available the DPR and EIA in the public domain and for a transparent and democratic public hearing of the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kssp-seeks-a-relook-into-silver-line/article32108446.ece

On Thursday, Neha became one of the students eligible for the Upper Secondary Scholarship (USS) of the General Education Department. This is the first time that a differently abled student receiving home-based education has won the scholarship. Neha who took admission to class 8 at Government Higher Secondary School, Kuttamath, Cheruvathur, Kasaragod, this year after completing her primary education from AUPS, Kovval, Cheruvathur, suffers from osteopetrosis, which causes bones to become dense and fracture. Teachers’ help She attended school only till class 2. For the past three years, a resource teacher of the Samagra Shiksha Kerala – first Lekha, and now Praseeda P.V. – has been going to Neha’s home once a week to help her study. Neha, daughter of ex-serviceman Prakashan P.V., and schoolteacher Deepa K., also suffers from lack of vision owing to her condition. She has now picked up Braille and can read and write in Malayalam and English. For the USS exam, Neha availed herself of the services of a scribe. Ms. Deepa, a teacher at a Government Welfare UPS, Cheruvathur, says Neha has only 3% vision, so they read out aloud to her and make recordings for her to listen. Ms. Praseeda then brings her the necessary resource material for studying. Ms. Praseeda says Neha is not only keen to learn new things, she is also quick to grasp them. When books became her world, she picked up words and usages quickly and was soon expressing her thoughts on paper. A collection of her poems was brought out by the Cheruvathur block resource centre of the Samagra Shiksha under the title Snehamritham . Besides friends, Neha’s teachers too were of great help and encouragement, says Ms. Praseeda. When she was having a hard time learning Hindi, her teacher as part of the Surili Hindi programme took along a few students and recreated the class environment in Neha’s house. Soon, she picked up the language. Love for Victers In her new school too, she is becoming familiar with her teachers and students through various activities to be taken up as part of the online classes on Victers. Neha who has been deprived of classroom teaching loves hearing the Victers classes, says Ms. Praseeda. Minister for General Education C. Ravindranath spoke to Neha over phone and congratulated her. In a Facebook post, the Minister promised her all support in her academic endeavours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/beating-back-ill-health-neha-posts-a-first/article32108454.ece

The committee's meeting will be held through a video conferencing facility. According to information, the committee will discuss a proposal to lay a pipeline to supply water to Chennai. The Tamil Nadu government is proposing laying of a pipeline from the Srisailam reservoir or the Somasila reservoir or from the Kandaleru reservoir to Tamil Nadu border. These three concept notes are under consideration of the Tamil Nadu government, which informed the board at the third meeting. Agenda The committee’s agenda includes ensuring drinking water supply to Chennai as per the inter-State agreement on top priority when the Kandaleru reservoir is adequate. The efficiency of conveyance may be improved and the lesser realisation due to intermediate drawals and unauthorised tapping may be avoided by insisting on better vigil on conveyance in Andhra Pradesh limits of the Kandaleru-Poondi canal, say the sources. Currently, the water is diverted by an open canal from the Kandaleru reservoir in Andhra Pradesh to Chennai's reservoirs. As per the Telugu Ganga project, started in the 1980s, Andhra Pradesh has to provide 12 tmcft annually to meet Chennai’s drinking water needs. The committee will also deliberate on working out plans by AP and Telangana for water withdrawals for the current year, that may include water release to Chennai city. As per the Bachawat Award, Chennai is entitled to 15 tmcft. Of this, 10 tmcft has to be released by Maharashtra and Karnataka, which they have not been doing. As a result, Chennai has been getting about three to four tmcft through the Telugu Ganga Project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/krmb-panel-to-discuss-plan-for-water-supply-to-chennai/article32108039.ece

The district now stands third in the State after Kurnool and Anantapur. While the State’s average doubling time is 11.3 days, in Guntur doubling rate stands at 10 days. In case, there is no improvement in the situation, special attention will be paid to social distancing, within the cluster, quarantine jumping, lack of proper clinical management practices, lack of protective gear by health care workers if most of them are being found positive. The Guntur district has 5,486 positive cases and of them 2,357 are active. On a positive note, the number of recoveries has gone up significantly. The ratio of active cases to confirmed cases stands at 0.4296. It is in testing parameters, the district seemed to be lagging with the testing ratio of 2.42 of the total population. The lack of proper testing infrastructure is forcing many to come to Government General Hospital and Infectious Diseases Hospital, Gorantla. Braving rain, many are standing in long queues in front of sole RT-PCR lab at the super specialty block. With many health workers in frontline testing positive, the stress on the largest teaching hospital is visible. 200 samples per day “We can handle just 200 samples per day, while more than 500 people are queuing up. We are doing tests round the clock and have just a single counter, to register the details of patients, track their sample ID,” said a health worker. The Rapid Antigen testing kits are not to be seen in the public space and the mobile testing vans are too in short supply and as a result, most of the people are forced to come to GGH, which is the largest referral hospital and has an out patient load of more than 3,000 daily. “We are braving the risk of infection at GGH, and will be happy if the mobile sample collection is done near our households,” says Praveen, a 42- year-old employee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/doubling-rate-of-cases-in-guntur-district-stands-at-10-days/article32108109.ece

17 July 2020||KADAPA,ANDHRA PRADESH||SCR’s innovative concept attracts first customer||The recent introduction of the ‘Round-trip traffic’ concept saw the first rake of South Central Railway utilised by Bharathi Cements, based at Yerraguntla in the district. Under the concept, clinker from the plant’s siding was loaded to Krishnapatnam port for export to Sri Lanka and in the return direction the rake brought the pet coke imported from the USA to the plant. The concept was introduced to enhance freight loading basket, attract new traffic and also to divert the traffic moving by road. Under the win-win scheme, the consignor (Bharathi Cements, in this case) commits to offer traffic in return direction, for which it is charged at a lower tariff, while the railways get revenue for the return direction too.

17 July 2020||New Delhi,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Jagan govt. pushing State towards jungle raj’||A delegation of Telugu Desam Party MPs met President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday and submitted a 53-page memorandum alleging that the Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSR Congress Party government was undermining the judiciary and other democratic institutions in the State. Party’s Lok Sabha floor leader Galla Jayadev led the delegation and was accompanied by Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar, K. Rammohan Naidu and Kesineni Srinivas. The MPs demanded investigations into the “irregularities” committed by the government. Job scheme dues The TDP alleged that the Sate government has failed to pay for works carried out under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNGREGS) under the material component despite funds being released by the Central government. Around Rs. 2,000 crore is pending under the material component for works carried out during the financial years 2017-18 and 2018-19. “The ruling YSRCP government in the last one year has been relentlessly pursuing anti-people policies, and in the process pushing the State towards jungle raj,” the TDP alleged in the representation. All the four pillars of democracy were being “undermined” and were under attack by the ruling party, the TDP alleged. The party said the government, citing its absolute majority, has started undermining courts. Their orders were not being followed by the State government and it was altering them as per its wishes. The delegation also alleged corruption by YSRCP leaders. It further complained to the President that TDP leaders were being harassed and hounded by the State government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jagan-govt-pushing-state-towards-jungle-raj/article32108244.ece
17 July 2020||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tobacco growers send SOS to board||Farmers in tradtional tobacco-growing areas in Prakasam and SPSR Nellore districts on Thusday urged the Tobacco Board to ensure offtake of low grade varieties by domestic cigarette manufacturers. Taking stock of the situation arising out of Markfed’s market intervention in the last 15 days, former Tobacco Board member P. Bhadri Reddy said the cigarette manufacturers were not so active in the market after the entry of Markfed leaving the exporters to dictate prices for low grade varieties, which accounted for the majority of the crop this year in view of adverse climatic conditions. As a result, the expected competition among the cigarette manufacturers and exporters in picking up the low grade varieties had not materialised, he said after a meeting of farmer leaders from auction platforms in the Southern Black Soil (SBS) and Southern Light Soil (SLS) regions. The prices fixed by the Markfed for various grades had not resulted in higher price realisation for the produce after 93 days of trading, YSR Congress Party Prakasam district farmers’ wing President Mareddy Subba Reddy lamented and wanted Markfed to purchase the produce at a remunerative price even if it meant losses during the market intervention operation as promised by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. They wanted Markfed to purchase non-grade tobacco at not less than Rs. 80 per kg and other low grade varieties at Rs. 100 per kg.  Crop holiday Farmers have so far marketed over 42 million kg of tobacco and are left with another 48 million kg as the lockdown came during the peak of the marketing season. “We will have no option but to press for drastic reduction in the crop size or even press for crop holiday during the next cropping season if the buyers do not come forward,” said farmers welfare association president at the Ongole II auction platform V.V. Prasad. They wanted the Tobacco Board to facilitate contract farming in Virginia tobacco akin to the arrangement entered into by cigarette manufacturers with farmers cultivating white burley tobacco.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tobacco-growers-send-sos-to-board/article32108625.ece

Mr. Balu said the cash was taken to Chennai to purchase gold from bullion traders as they were not ready to visit Ongole in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was unfortunate that the TDP was unnecessarily dragging the Minister’s name into the issue and demanding his resignation, he said, adding that he would submit necessary supporting documents for the cash to the Tamil Nadu police. The cash was seized from the car that reportedly had a fake MLA sticker on it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ongole-jeweller-claims-cash-seized-in-tn/article32108610.ece

Eight persons succumbed in Ongole, taking the toll to 21 in Prakasam district. In Nellore, the toll increased to 16 with three more deaths, health officials said.’ Containment zones Five more containment zones were formed in Prakasam as 125 persons from across the district tested positive. With this, the tally shot up to 1,806, which had 47 very active clusters and 76 active clusters. The health condition of 400 patients was stable, health officials said. Meanwhile, 44 patients were cured of the disease and discharged from hospital. As many as 2,255 persons tested negative during the period. A four-year-old girl from Kanigiri and a six-year-old boy from Ongole were among the infected. Lockdown was strictly enforced in Ongole which registered the highest number of 22 fresh cases. It topped the district in the incidence with 334 confirmed cases. Relaxations to lockdown were withdrawn also in Chirala and Kandukur towns,which reported 17 new cases each to take the count to 172 and 125 respectively.

17 July 2020||Tirumala,ANDHRA PRADESH||14 priests test positive for virus in Tirumala||In a shocking development, 14 archakas working at Tirumala tested positive for COVID-19 and have been shifted to Tirupati, where they have been admitted into Srinivasam quarantine centre for better medical care. Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy, who is camping atop the hill town, immediately closeted with senior officials and took stock of the situation in the backdrop of growing number of positive cases. He called the priests working at the hill temple and inquired about the state of affairs that led to the sudden spurt in the positive cases among them. Briefing the media, Mr. Reddy on Thursday said the overall tally of TTD personnel affected by the virus so far stood at 140. Majority of them were associated either with APSP battalion or security, while the rest were working in the ‘potu’ and other departments, including archakas. While more than 70 personnel had been cured and some of them reported to their duties, the rest are either in home quarantine or under treatment, but for one employee whose condition is said to be stable despite his admission into ICU in SVIMS Hospital. The silver lining is that not even a single devotee who has visited the temple thus far had reported any kind of infection after his return to his native destination, nor is there any incident to corroborate that TTD staff remained infected by the visiting pilgrims. Though safety of pilgrims is paramount, the role of archakas should not be undermined for the temple cannot function without them. “We are even ready to stop darshan for the pilgrims, but cannot compromise with the well- being of priests, as they play a pivotal role in the execution of day-to-day rituals relating to the deity,” he said. It is for this reason that the management, on the request of the priests, decided to provide them individual accommodation, supply proper food and extend more hygienic environs for their stay while at Tirumala. Mr. Reddy instructed the officials to deal their grievances with a pragmatic approach such as allocating temporary duties at Tirupati for those aged above 60 years or allowing them for home quarantine subject to health conditions and so on. Brahmotsavams Asked about conducting of Brahmotsavams in September, Mr. Reddy shot back saying it was too early to come to a decision at a time when the country was plagued with the deadly virus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/14-tirumala-priests-test-positive-for-covid-19/article32108033.ece
17 July 2020||Tirumala,ANDHRA PRADESH||Ramana Dikshitulu’s comments kick up new controversy||Honorary chief priest A.V. Ramana Dikshitulu on Thursday kicked up a fresh controversy when he took to the Twitter and accused the TTD officials of still following the “anti-hereditary archaka and anti-Brahmin policies” pursued by the TDP and its supremo N. Chandrababu Naidu. Tagging Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy in his tweet, Mr. Dikshitulu alleged that the TTD EO and the AEO were refusing to halt darshan at the hill temple despite 15 of the 50 archakas contracting COVID-19. This apart, the test results of another 25 priests were awaited, he said. Warning of severe complications if the situation continued, he urged the Chief Minister to take action immediately. Meanwhile, TTD Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy took strong exception to Mr. Dikshitulu’s comments. Unfortunate, says YV It was unfortunate that Mr. Dikshitulu took to social media for airing his grievances, he said. “He is not only an honorary chief priest of the famed temple but also holds the post of Agama adviser. Instead of politicising the issue, he could have brought it to the notice of the management,” he said. Meanwhile, Mr. Dikshitulu was heavily trolled by the Twitterati, with a majority of them heaping criticism and sarcastic remarks on his allegations with regard to the missing pink diamond.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ramana-dikshitulus-comments-kick-up-new-controversy/article32108615.ece

Asthanam was rendered upon the deities of Malayappa Swamy and his two consorts seated atop the golden Sarva Bhoopala Vahanam in the presence of Viswaksena, the commander-in-chief of the army of the Lord, at Bangaru Vakili followed by other festivities in adherence to the COVID health advisories. As is the tradition, both senior and junior pontiffs of the temple along with TTD Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy, Executive Officer Anilkumar Singhal and Additional EO A.V. Dharma Reddy presented four pairs of silk vastrams to be adorned to the deities. Earlier, the authorities from the Sri Ranganathaswamy temple at Srirangam in Tamil Nadu customarily presented six pairs of silk vastrams to the temple which were carried in a procession from the Bedi Anjaneyaswamy temple after going around the mada streets. However, the procession of Pushpa Pallaki on the thoroughfares of the hill town was not observed this time owing to COVID-19 restrictions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fervour-marks-anivara-asthanam-at-tirumala/article32108627.ece
17 July 2020||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Demand for Balaji district resurfaces||As the State government decides to carve out new districts, the demand for creation of Balaji district with Tirupati as its headquarters resurfaced after a gap of three decades.  Delimitation exercise The yardstick to create new districts on the lines of parliamentary constituencies is the delimitation exercise taken up ahead of 2009 general elections. In fact, the process had then come under sharp criticism for being ‘skewed’ and not reflecting the geographical contiguity or regional aspirations. For example, the exercise cleaved the temple city of Tirupati in the middle, appending the south-western parts into Chandragiri Assembly constituency and the eastern portion into Srikalahasti. As Chandragiri is part of the Chittoor Lok Sabha constituency, half of the city voters elect an MP who cares little for the fringe area. Similarly, the Tirupati Lok Sabha constituency has seven Assembly segments, of which three viz., Tirupati, Srikalahasti and Satyavedu are from Chittoor district, and four viz., Gudur, Venkatagiri, Sullurpet and Sarvepalli from Nellore, giving a dominant say to Nellore segments. The original idea for Balaji district took shape during the time of the late N.T. Rama Rao by clubbing Venkatagiri from Nellore and Railway Kodur from Kadapa districts to the eastern half of Chittoor, with Tirupati as headquarters. For all practical purposes, the Department of Stamps and Registration has already marked lands in and around Tirupati as ‘Sri Balaji district’. “Mythologically and historically, we have several landmarks and temples in Tirupati, Srikalahasti, Chandragiri, Puthalapattu and Satyavedu associated with Lord Venkateswara. Creation of Balaji district should take note of people’s sentiments and not done in an arbitrary manner”, observes Congress State general secretary D. Rambhupal Reddy. TDP leader and SAAP former Chairman P.R. Mohan said the proposal was first mooted in 1990s, in view of Chittoor district’s wide span measuring 360 km from Kuppam on the Karnataka border to Satyavedu on the Tamil Nadu side. “When former Chief Minister Nedurumalli Janardhan Reddy mooted the idea, we all joined hands apolitically to support the move, but it was nowhere to be seen,” he recalled. All political parties have requested the high-level committee vested with the job to understand geographical contiguity before defining the contours of the new district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/demand-for-balaji-district-resurfaces/article32108629.ece

17 July 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Hearing on Atchan bail plea posted to July 20||The High Court on Thursday posted the hearing on the bail petition of TDP MLA and former Minister K. Atchannaidu to July 20. A single-judge Bench comprising Justice C. Manavendranath Roy heard both sides on the ESI scandal which involved massive irregularities in the procurement of medical supplies / services and equipment for ESI hospitals. Advocate-General (A-G) S. Sriram told the court that Mr. Naidu, who was Minister for Labour, had given clearances for the purchases made since 2016 in blatant violation of norms. He said details of the fraudulent purchases were submitted to the ACB court in Vijayawada which was dealing with the matter. Mr. Sriram contended that contracts were awarded and purchases made by circumventing the tendering and e-procurement procedures to benefit some private companies. The petitioner’s advocate insisted that prior consent of the Governor of the State or Legislative Assembly Speaker should have been obtained before launching the prosecution as Mr. Naidu had taken the decisions as a Minister and the alleged scandal is being investigated now. The A-G differed with that, saying no such prior permission was required as there was no evidence of adherence to the relevant policies and procedures. He pointed out that tenders should be invited for awarding any contract or availing services costing more than Rs. 1 lakh as per the AP Finance Code and GOs issued from time to time but it was not followed in the present case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hearing-on-atchan-bail-plea-posted-to-july-20/article32108154.ece

In a series of tweets on Thursday, Mr. Naidu said Mr. Ramakrishna's only fault was to stand up for the Dalit families whose assigned lands were being forcibly taken away by 'land grabbers' of the YSRCP. “This is one of the many incidents of atrocities being carried out on Dalit intellectuals including former MP Harsha Kumar, Dr. Sudhakar, Dr. Anitha Rani, and Mahasena Rajesh,” he said. “Dalit intellectuals must unite to fight this trend with one voice and reclaim what is rightfully theirs,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-condemns-attack-on-dalit-judge/article32108113.ece

17 July 2020||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||Coronavirus cases likely to peak in August||Coronavirus cases have gone up by over 600% in the district ever since the lifting of the lockdown. According to estimates by the district administration, the coronavirus cases will peak in the months of August and September. “The conservative estimate is that the district might be recording close to 10,000 cases by September. We expect to see the curve flattening in October,” District Collector V. Vinay Chand said. As of Thursday morning, the total number of positive cases recorded was 2,456, with 1,034 active cases and 1,382 discharges. To fight the sudden spurt in cases, the district administration has decided that only those who test positive for COVID-19 and fall in the high-risk category, such as senior citizens and those with co-morbidities or underlying diseases, shall be admitted to hospital. There are eight designated COVID-19 hospitals such as GIMSR, VIMS, NRI, Gayatri, Pradhama and Care. “We have now decided to convert King George Hospital too into a COVID hospital. The CSR block in KGH will be equipped with 300 beds and declared as a COVID block soon. This apart, we are going to add another 150 beds in VIMS and have asked all the medical colleges such as GIMSR, NRI and Gayatri Medical College to increase their existing capacity from 20% to 30%,” Mr. Vinay Chand said. As of now, the district administration is ready with close to 4,100 beds, and of them, 1,670 beds are connected with one-line oxygen and 1,000 with three-line oxygen system. “Our goal is to increase the number of beds to 5,000 and have all beds connected to at least a single-line oxygen system,” the Collector said. According to District COVID-19 Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College Dr. P.V. Sudhakar, as per the new protocol, only high-risk groups and those with serious health complications will be admitted to hospitals. “Fortunately, in our district, 90- 95% of the cases are asymptomatic or mild cases. Moreover, the discharge percentage is good,” he said, As per the new COVID protocol, all asymptomatic and mild cases will be admitted to COVID Care Centres. “In GVMC limits, close to 3,000 beds are ready and being used. We have taken over two hostel complexes in Marikavalasa, which cater to about 1,000 beds, and the Hudhud housing complexes accommodate close to 1,400 beds. But now, we have decided to have at least one 300-bedded CCC at every Assembly constituency other than those under GVMC limits,” said Mr. Vinay Chand. There are 10 Assembly constituencies in the district apart from those under GVMC limits and once they come up by this month-end, the beds at CCCs will rise to over 7,000. “Since most of our cases are asymptomatic and mild, the focus is on CCCs. Each CCC will have a doctor present round the clock and if a patient develops complications, he or she will be immediately shifted to a hospital. In the last 15 days, we saw just one such case,” the Collector said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/coronavirus-cases-likely-to-peak-in-august/article32108642.ece
17 July 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Vizag is bound to become Executive Capital of State’||Rajya Sabha Member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy on Thursday alleged that TDP president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has been resorting to all sorts of conspiracies ever since Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy announced that Visakhapatnam would be made the Executive Capital of Andhra Pradesh, to stop it from becoming a reality. Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy was participating in the foundation stone-laying programmes for various developmental works along with Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao, at Madhurawada and in the 5th ward of the city. Speaking on the occasion, the YSR Congress Party MP alleged that Mr. Naidu was politicising each and every issue in a bid to mar the brand image of the city. He, however, said that Vizag was bound to become the Executive Capital and that a special master plan was formulated for the development of the city. He called upon the people to see through “the game plan” of Mr. Naidu to stall the development of Vizag. He recalled that the development of the city was initiated during the tenure of Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy and after him, Mr. Jagan had initiated measures for the development of the city.  ‘Ganta next’ Mr. Srinivasa Rao alleged that former Minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao and his followers had indulged in land grabbing in the past. He would be the next to be arrested after former Minister K. Atchannaidu, who was allegedly involved in the ESI scam. He said that after the YSR Congress came to power, not even one square yard of land was grabbed in the city. Land, valued at Rs. 400 crore, was saved from being grabbed. On the contrary, the Telugu Desam rule in the past five years was marked by land grabbing and crimes. Grandiose plans He appealed to the local people not to dispose of their lands as Vizag becoming the Executive Capital was imminent. Trams would be introduced on Beach Road and Metro rail and Bhogapuram International Airport would become a reality. He alleged that Mr. Naidu was trying to spoil the brand image of Visakhapatnam by magnifying negative aspects such as the recent industrial accidents in the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vizag-is-bound-to-become-executive-capital-of-state/article32108609.ece

17 July 2020||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||CPI opposes privatisation of train routes by Railways||The privatisation of some profit-making train routes by the BJP-ruled Central Government is causing immense hardships to the common man, the Communist Party India (CPI) said on Thursday. A protest was organised by the CPI outside Visakhapatnam Railway Station with a 100-foot long banner against the privatisation of the Indian Railways. Addressing the gathering, CPI State assistant secretary J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy said that a decision was taken by the Railways to give 151 trains on lease in 109 routes for a period of 35 years to 25 companies, including Adani Port, Tata Realty and Infrastructure and Bombardier India. “The privatisation of trains on some routes, even as the infrastructure like tracks and stations belong to the Indian Railways, would result in an undue burden on the common man in the form of increased ticket fares,” Mr. Murthy said. He alleged that the BJP government’s move to privatise profit-making routes was meant to benefit big investors at the cost of the poor. The privatisation would benefit private entities at the cost of the Railways, which would lose a major share of its revenue, he claimed. Mr. Murthy sought to know when the Visakhapatnam-headquartered South Coast Railway Zone (SCoR) would start functioning. He wondered why the State Government was silent on the issue. He also demanded to know from the Railways about the status of the LHB coaches that were allotted to the Waltair Division. CPI District Council secretary B. Venkata Ramana, assistant secretary M. Pydiraju, party leaders S.K. Rehaman, P. Eswara Rao, R. Srinivasa Rao and B.

17 July 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Waterfalls draw good number of tourists||With all the major tourist destinations in the cities and towns of the district remaining closed for visitors in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, those with itchy feet appear to be finding solace in the offbeat spots and natural bounty in the hinterland. The waterfalls in the tribal mandals of the district and the scenic spots in Visakha Agency have been receiving a good number of visitors since the last few weeks. All the tourism destinations in the city and towns in the district including its pristine beaches have been closed for visitors ever since the coronavirus cases began to rise in March. Confined to their houses since the last several months, many people are now making short trips to the waterfalls and scenic valleys in the Agency. Lambasingi, the most-favoured winter destination of the State, is receiving good number of visitors during the weekends, say the locals. Sariya waterfalls near Devarapalle, Kothapalle waterfalls in G. Madugula mandal, Yerravaram waterfalls near Chintapalle and a few others in Sileru, Darakonda and Ananthagiri mandals have been recording considerable footfalls after the lockdown norms were relaxed. “We get to spend some time in the lap of the nature. Even a short visit to these waterfalls help us deal with the anxiety pertaining to the pandemic. Many are preferring a day-long trip,” says a youth, who recently visited Visakha Agency. Safety measures “Many people, especially youngsters, are visiting the waterfalls in remote areas, as there is no hassles of passing through entry or exit gates. There are no huge gatherings too. However, we wore masks all through out visit and used sanitisers frequently during the trip,” he says. “We have been witnessing visitors spending their day at Sariya waterfalls after the lockdown norms were relaxed,” says P. Anand, a resident of Devarapalle. Short trips The Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corrporation (APTDC) officials say that the hotels under their purview in the Agency have been receiving tourists since the past few weeks. “However, a majority of them are either locals or people from the nearby places. They are coming here on short trips and most of them are returning by the evening,” says an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/waterfalls-draw-good-number-of-tourists/article32108631.ece

The technologies selected for support are in the areas of manufacture of test kits, sanitisers, ventilators, PPEs, masks and effluent treatment at COVID-19 hospitals. The NRDC, an enterprise under DSIR, Union Ministry of Science and Technology, plays a vital role by acting like a bridge between industry and institutions by identifying viable innovations and giving them to entrepreneurs for taking up commercial production. Proposals sought The NRDC had invited proposals from innovators across the country under its DSIR grants-in-aid promotional programme for development of technologies for commercialisation (PDTC) for up-scaling the COVID-19-related technologies. “A three-member external technology expert committee short-listed the 16 projects from among 65 entries for funding based on their technical feasibility and relevance,” NRDC CMD H. Purushotham told The Hindu . They include IIT, Delhi, Sahajanand Technologies Private Limited, IDEMI, Mumbai and INM Indian Navy, Mumbai. The two proposals from AP are atmospheric movable cabin alternative to PPE (SRIT, Anantapur) and high capacity disinfectant spraying machine with auto-retractable hose heel for use in large public spaces (Ramachandra College of Engineering, Eluru). “We will fund the selected projects and the researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs have to begin the work for further development and commercial production at the earliest. Our second component is Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection and technology transfer and we help in the identification of prospective clients for commercialisation of the innovations developed by the research institutes. We are currently working with over 500 institutes, including private entities, for the technology transfer programme and have already filed about 2,000 patents and transferred about 5,000 technologies in India and abroad particularly to MSMEs and startups,” he said. “The financial support is given for development of COVID-19 technologies in the area of tracking, testing and treatment, covering process scale up, pilot plant studies, validation/authentication of the product, registration of the product with regulatory authorities, conducting field trials and generation of toxicology data,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/two-ap-tech-projects-to-fight-covid-19-picked-for-central-funding/article32108623.ece

17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||King cobras slither out of their natural habitat as humans remain indoors||Murthy Kantimahanti and his team at Eastern Ghats Wildlife Society (EGWS) have never been busier in summers before. Regular phone calls from people about king cobras slithering into farms and houses in the rural areas surrounding Visakhapatnam kept them on their toes. “This is unusual. King cobras venturing into human habitations in summer is a rare occurrence in the Eastern Ghat region. But, we have rescued four king cobras in the past two months,” says Mr. Murthy, founder of the EGWS. The society is a grassroots level non-proﬁt organisation working for conservation of wildlife in the Eastern Ghat region, by promoting the idea of people living in harmony with the nature. According to Mr. Murthy, the incidents of human-snake conflict are on the rise during the lockdown imposed to check the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Murthy and his team rescued a king cobra which holed up in a tree stump for three days in East Godavari district on April 9. Following the incident, four more king cobras were rescued from Devarapalli mandal during April and May. “We rescued 11 king cobras between April 2019 and May 2020, most of them from rural mandals in Visakhapatnam district. Last year, the EGWS rescued 135 snakes of 12 different species from the north eastern ghats region. Less human activity “Less human activity owing to the lockdown could be the reason snakes venturing into uncharted territories or just frequenting to the areas they would not slither into otherwise,” observes Mr. Murthy. The EGWS is collaborating with the Forest Department and Madras Crocodile Bank Trust on a project aiming at conservation of king cobra populations in the Eastern Ghat region in Andhra Pradesh. The project is also supported by Houston Zoo and Disney Conservation Fund. In the red zone Threatened by rapid destruction of their natural habitat, king cobra, the world’s longest venomous snake, has been listed as ‘vulnerable’ in the IUCN Red List since 2010. “The king cobras are being killed on sight by people indiscriminately in the north Eastern Ghat region, which calls for measures to protect the species. King cobra predominantly feed on other snakes . The species plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance,” Mr. Murthy points out, ahead of World Snake Day which is observed globally on July 16 every year. Human-snake conflict In a bid to provide on-the-ground solutions to mitigate human-snake conﬂicts, the EGWS is working with four local field assistants who cover Cheedikada, Devarapalli and Madugula mandals. The society has reached out to 36 villages so far as part of the human-snake conflict mitigation programmes. “Support of NGOs is vital in expanding our reach to rural pockets of the region. In East Godavari and Krishna districts, we distributed snake kits to the snake rescuers in the past,” says Ananth Shanker, District Forest Officer, Visakhapatnam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/king-cobras-slither-out-of-their-natural-habitat-as-humans-remain-indoors/article32108621.ece

Statistics suggest that a three-fold rise has been reported. With the news of priests of Lord Venkatewswara temple contracting the infection surfacing, eyebrows are being raised on the implementatin of COVID-19 protocols at the hill shrine and the preaparedness of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) to check the spread of virus. Accusing the temple trust board of misleading the government on the COVID situation, Congress leader P. Naveen Kumar Reddy demanded action against the TTD. “A senior priest of the temple took to the Twitter to level many allegations. Now, the TTD must put the record straight,” he said. Meanwhile, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) urged that the TTD management to ‘lend an ear to the silent pleas of the employees and priests’. “Will the TTD take responsibility if something happens to the priests?, asked TNSF national coordinator and TDP youth leader A.

Squarely blaming the decision to allow devotees from most-affected States such as Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra for the spurt in the cases, both the parties said that the denizens of Tirumala and Tirupati would be at more risk of contracting the infection, if the Tirumala temple remained open for darshan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/opposition-parties-blame-ttd-for-priests-contracting-infection/article32108590.ece

17 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Telangana sees over 10,000 cases in seven days||A little over 10,000 COVID-19 cases were recorded in Telangana in the past seven days. The total number of cases in the State crossed 40,000 on Thursday. The total now stands at 41,018. When compared with other States, Telangana stands in seventh position in terms of number of cases. The first case in the State was detected on March 2. While it took 115 days (March 2-June 24) to record 10,444 cases, 10,018 more cases were recorded in nine days (June 25-July 3), six days (July 4-9) to record 10,484 more cases. And it took seven days (July 10-16) to record further 10,072 cases which indicates that rapid increase in COVID cases continues. The past one week witnessed significant incidents, decisions related to COVID cases and its management. It is from July 10 that number of tests to detect coronavirus increased dramatically. The State Health department started to use Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) to detect coronavirus. This, in addition to RT-PCR tests, led to spike in tests. Anywhere between 3,000 to 6,500 tests were conducted in a day from June 20 to July 9. Over 10,000 tests in a day were performed from July 10 barring on July 12. However, cases detected in a day dipped for three days (July 10-12) and started to rise again. While the tests performed helped the State Health department to battle criticism against less number of tests, other issues kept the department officials on their toes. Outsourced employees at Gandhi Hospital - largest health facility where moderate to critical patients are admitted-took to protest demanding hike in salaries, regularisation of job. It was called off after assurances to address some of their demands was given. While protests rocked Gandhi Hospital, unhygienic conditions at another major government tertiary care centre-Osmania General Hospital- unfolded on Monday and Wednesday. Regarding treatment, Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS), Gachibowli, was finally opened to admit COVID-19 patients. Besides, officials said that treatment and tests would be offered free of cost to COVID-19 patients. As complaints against private hospitals increased, Director of Public Health G Srinivasa Rao said that people can lodge their grievances through Whatsapp at 9154 170 960.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/telangana-sees-over-10000-cases-in-seven-days/article32108358.ece
17 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||No specific Act in State to protect camels: govt.||The State government has not made any specific Act to protect camels, the Veterinary and Animal Husbandry department informed Telangana High Court. In a counter affidavit filed in the HC over a PIL petition seeking a direction to the government to protect camels and check their slaughtering, the department Director V. Lakshma Reddy stated that no specific Act to protect camels on the lines of Rajasthan Camel Protection Act was made by the government. The petition came up for hearing by a bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy. Though there was no special Act to protect camels, the State government was enforcing all provisions of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960, Mr. Reddy stated. Other rules like Animal Transportation Rules and Slaughter House rules made by the Central government were being implemented in toto by Telangana government, the affidavit said. Referring to the petitioner’s contention that camels were being transported illegally from Rajasthan to Hyderabad for slaughtering, the director stated that it was an ‘age-old practice of one community to consume camel meat during Ramzan festival month’. However, slaughtering of camels is not allowed in any of the slaughter houses in the State, the director said. Killing of any animal outside slaughter houses is an illegal activity in the State, the affidavit mentioned. In the past six years, no specific cases of illegal transportation of camels were registered by the Transport department. Telangana State was not a natural habitat of camel. A few people raise camels as fancy or for joy rides for children, the director stated. As per the Livestock Census-2019, there were 71 camels in the State. The plea came up for hearing on Thursday. The bench posted the hearing to Friday (today) as it had to peruse documents presented by the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-specific-act-in-state-to-protect-camels-govt/article32108402.ece
17 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Final year exams only for degree, PG and engineering||Only the final year degree, post-graduation and engineering students will go for exams in Telangana to maintain academic sanctity in universities as per the guidelines of University Grants Commission (UGC) and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). All the others in the three streams of university education will be promoted to the next higher class without any exams. This was decided at a meeting convened by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao with officials to discuss various aspects of academic calendar in the State on Thursday. It was also decided to begin the new academic year for engineering colleges from August 17 but defer reopening of schools and the model of education till the release of guidelines by the Centre and studying trends in other States. A decision on schools will also be spelt out shortly, a release said after the meeting. The government will also release the schedule for conduct of common entrance tests for various professional courses. The release added that Mr. Rao instructed officials to organise a workshop soon with education experts and experienced persons on the educational standards in schools, Intermediate and degree colleges and other educational institutions in government sector. He promised to implement a long-term action plan to strengthen government institutions after a thorough overhaul of the educational system. A meeting should be organised shortly with educationists, subject experts to gather their views on this, he asked officials. Mr. Rao insisted with them to strictly adhere by UGC and AICTE guidelines in the wake of COVID-19 for the functioning of institutions of higher learning, conduct of exams and syllabus. He expressed the view that exploitation in the garb of education could be checked only with substantial increase in teaching and operational standards of government educational institutions. After formation of Telangana, the government is focussed on addressing issues sector wise with the aim to provide permanent solutions to long-term problems of people. The government had overcome power, drinking and irrigation water, agriculture, land grabbing, gambling and arrack problems that plagued people, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/final-year-exams-only-for-degree-pg-and-engineering/article32108388.ece
17 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||OGH likely to be flooded again, say doctors||A day after rain water from storm water drains flooded Osmania General Hospital (OGH)’s in-patient (IP) ward, doctors and staff of the hospital said that water might stagnate in the block again if it rained heavily. They said that lives of patients were at stake because of the appalling unhygienic conditions. COVID-19 spreads through droplets, and droplets from an infected person might spread faster if unhygienic conditions persist throughout the monsoon, they said. Currently, COVID-19 suspects are admitted to the hospital’s out-patient (OP) block. While rain water flowed into the IP ward on Monday, it gushed into the building on Wednesday. The situation was however, addressed by Thursday morning. A section of the General Medicine department is located on the ground floor of the IP building. The Intermediate Care unit too is on the ground floor. Besides, three operation theatres (OT) are on this building constructed in 1917. Patients who need emergency surgeries such as amputation of body parts due to gangrene, stitching of perforations in body, and other operations, are taken to OTs. In-charge superintendent of the hospital R. Pandu Naik said that around 65 in-patients in General Medicine ward, and Intermediate Care unit, were shifted to safe premises. “They were shifted to the Quli Qutb Shah block. Some more patients would be shifted shortly,” Dr. Naik said. However, OTs continued to function there. “If rainwater stagnates in the building again, patients have to be taken on stretchers and wheelchairs in that murky water,” a doctor who performs surgeries there said. Dr. Naik said that alternate OTs would be identified soon. “There is another entrance to the hospital. But it is a roundabout way. In any case, water usually flows into the ground floor when it rains. We would not be left with any other option but walk in that water to reach the OTs,” the doctor said. While operations were performed in the OP block, the OTs in the IP block were used for the last five days. Sources in the hospital said that the GHMC was asked to address the issue related to storm water lines that lie underground the hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ogh-likely-to-be-flooded-again-say-doctors/article32108354.ece
17 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Without COVID report, no admission to hospital?||COVID-19 test reports have become the most demanded prerequisite for both infected and uninfected patients trying to get admission in private hospitals for emergency medical treatment. Where the patients are not infected but have other ailments, hospital authorities are seeking COVID-19 test to be done before admission, thereby losing the golden hour wherein the patients can be saved. A case in point was S. Anasuya, a 75-year-old from Seetaphalmandi, who died of paralytic stroke last week. She was taken to several private and corporate hospitals after the stroke, but refused admission everywhere. “I first took her to a renowned diagnostic centre in Secunderabad, where MRI was done upon our request. The staff there told us, she could be saved if given an injection within three hours. I rushed her to the emergency care of a corporate hospital, where they demanded COVID-19 test as she had a little cough,” S. Shiva, her son, related. Thereafter, he approached several hospitals, and everywhere received the same stock reply. Finally, she was admitted to a nondescript nursing home, but they soon gave up on her and asked him to take her to Osmania General Hospital. “There, they took samples for COVID-19 test. But looking at the conditions in the OGH, my mother begged me to take her home, and I had no choice but to bring her back. She breathed her last at home, and two days later, we received her COVID-19 test result. It was negative,” Shiva shared. While such was the condition of patients without infection, admission to hospital is difficult even for COVID-19 positive patients, if they do not produce proof. Despite the fact that COVID-19 patients are heavily stigmatised and nobody would falsely claim a positive status, hospital authorities are denying admission without report. No proof Unfortunately, in majority of such cases, patients end up not having any proof on them, as they would have learnt of their positive status only through phone. After the rapid antigen tests have come into use, reports are the last thing the labs are bothering themselves with. This is the case especially wherever mass tests are conducted at workplaces. “We were tested at home by a team from government hospital using rapid antigen sticks. Within half an hour, they declared six of us positive and left. When asked for reports, they told us to take the pictures of the sticks. We stayed in home isolation for 10 days, after which my brother’s situation has worsened. He had a hard time getting admission to a corporate hospital as there were no reports. “We had to pull quite some strings to get him admitted,” Sudhakar (name changed), a patient, shared. Patients requiring Remdesivir injection too were being asked to produce diagnostic reports, but several of them were unable to as their results were conveyed orally, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/without-covid-report-no-admission-to-hospital/article32108377.ece
17 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Only 5 out of 38 warmers fully functional at Gandhi||Newborns at hospitals require radiant warmers immediately after birth. But, only five among the 38 radiant warmers are fully functional at Gandhi Hospital. This is a cause of serious concern as babies born to COVID positive mothers are kept away from the women until their test results come negative. For the last few days, around 20 babies have been kept away from their mothers on any given day, at the hospital, sources said. “Since they cannot be kept in contact with their coronavirus positive mothers, all these newborns have to be kept under warmers regardless of whether they are low weight, pre-mature or not. At times, two babies are kept in one warmer or wrapped in a blanket,” said sources in the hospital, who attend to babies in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU). However, the hospital authorities said that only one or two babies a day might need radiant warmers and that the demand do not exceed availability. The process of procuring more of these medical devices was initiated, they said. “If a mother is COVID positive and the results of her baby are awaited, her newborn is admitted to NICU. If the baby tests positive, the newborn is handed over to the mother. Else, the baby is admitted to NICU,” sources said. Anywhere between four to five deliveries are performed every day. There were 38 newborns on Tuesday, and 28 on Thursday. “All of them need warmers. The 38 radiant warmers at the hospital were procured in 2011. Over the past two-and-half-years, 23 have become dysfunctional. Only five are fully functional. The rest have to be used manually which is not possible during the pandemic. At times, two babies are kept in one warmer. When the demand is more, they are wrapped in blankets. There is a need for more warmers,” sources said. When contacted, the superintendent of the hospital M. Raja Rao said that they have placed a request for more radiant warmers and these will be procured soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/only-5-out-of-38-warmers-fully-functional-at-gandhi/article32108355.ece
17 July 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Congress leaders blame KCR||Congress leaders led by Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy visited the Osmania General Hospital (OGH) on Thursday, a day after water entered some wards, and held Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao responsible for the deteriorating condition of the hospital. Accompanied by senior Congress leaders, including Hyderabad City Congress president M. Anjan Kumar Yadav, Feroz Khan, Mohd Ghouse, Adam Santosh and others, Mr. Reddy inspected the wards that got submerged due to rain water and also had a detailed interaction with the in-charge superintendent, Resident Medical Officer and patients. Later, speaking to reporters, he said that the estimates and blue print for construction of a new building in the same OGH complex at a cost of Rs. 500 crore has been pending for approval since 2017. While giving financial approval for a new building, he said that the State government must ensure that the heritage structure of OGH remained intact and strengthened further. He said that storm water entering the wards housing in-patients reflected on the poor functioning of this government and it should be ashamed. “Under KCR’s regime, the hospital has reached a stage where minor rains submerged the functional wards causing huge inconvenience to patients,” he said. The TPCC chief said that in-charge superintendent R. Pandu Naik told the Congress leaders that nearly 150 doctors, including a full-time superintendent, were tested COVID positive. “This reflects on the quality and untimely delivery of PPE kits given to doctors,” he said. He also demanded that OGH be strengthened with upgradation of facilities. He also demanded that the Chief Minister dropped the ‘non-sense’ idea of demolition of the Secretariat and start constructing a new building for OGH.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/congress-leaders-blame-kcr/article32108363.ece
17 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||NGO offers to translocate trees free of cost||While the demolition of the Secretariat buildings is being heard in the High Court, a local voluntary body known for its tree translocation expertise has come forward to move the decades-old trees inside to a 'safer' location to give them a fresh lease of life. Vata Foundation trustee P. Uday Krishna tweeted to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Minister for Municipal Administration K.T. Rama Rao and others offering to translocate the trees likely to face the axe in the old Secretariat during the ongoing demolition for free. The foundation tweeted that if the dream of the Chief Minister was to build a new Secretariat and that of KTR was to build a new elevated corridor at Indira Park. Tree lovers’ dream was to save as many trees as possible which faced the axe, as many people were ready to contribute for the cause. Mr. Krishna pointed out that the foundation had been able to save close to 100 trees during construction of other flyovers and road expansion programmes in the twin cities and on the outskirts in recent times with crowd funding and almost all of them survived in relocated places of schools, farms and gated communities. "There could be more than 100 mature trees inside the Secretariat. Ideally, they can be moved to the identified green spaces inside the complex to facilitate construction of new buildings. Or, they can be moved just outside the complex which actually costs nothing," he explained. Alternatively, the foundation was ready to move the trees even 100 km away at no cost to the government and the present balmy weather was ideal for such kind of translocation. In fact, it had just accepted an offer in Goa to relocate 50-decade-old trees from a notified special economic zone to the green space identified in the layout to save them from getting chopped, the trustee claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ngo-offers-to-translocate-trees-free-of-cost/article32108376.ece
17 July 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||KCR busy raising loans: Cong.||The Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhatti Vikramarka and Manthani MLA D. Sreedhar Babu said Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is busy raising loans even during the pandemic, leaving people to their fate. At a press conference here, Mr. Vikramarka said the Chief Minister had got approval from the Governor to raise loans recently while being blind to the Corona situation in the State. He said in the last four months, the Chief Minister raised Rs. 30,000 crore loans, adding to the already huge burden of Rs. 3 lakh crore loans. He said the Chief Minister is focussing on demolition of Secretariat complex and its construction, spending hundreds of crores, not bothering about people’s education and health issues and employment loss. He demanded the government to issue a white paper on the loans acquired by the State. Mr. Vikramarka also took a jibe at the IT Minister, K.T. Rama Rao, saying he was good at speaking and doing nothing. While the CM has totally ignored the coronavirus situation, by moving to his farmhouse, Minister K.T. Rama Rao too has failed to instil any confidence among people, he said. Mr. Sreedhar Babu said Congress has been demanding the government to include corona in Arogyasri for the last three months but the Chief Minister is silent, and it reflects the lack of his seriousness. He said the Congress wanted the government to construct a new building for Osmania General Hospital in the open space in its complex six years ago but nothing has been done so far. The former Minister said that the Chief Minister and Health Minister E. Rajender are directly responsible for the poor facilities in government hospitals. Vacancies in the Health Department have not been filled and just 30 people are working in place of 300 people. He said it is not proper to demolish the Secretariat and inaugurate flyovers.  Chief Minister and Health Minister are responsible for the poor facilities in government hospitals.   D.

After launching the association, Mr. Narayan Reddy and office-bearers P. Rathore (vice-president), Satyanarayana Reddy (secretary) and A. Narender (treasurer) met Health Minister Eatala Rajender to request him to frame guidelines for plasma donations in Telangana. Responding to his request, Mr. Rajender called the Director of Medical Education, Director of Public Health and other senior officials asking them to gather information from the governments of Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Odisha and other states on steps taken by them to boost plasma therapy. He asked them to frame the guidelines or Standard Operating Procedures (SoP) to encourage plasma therapy in the State. During the meeting, Mr. Narayan Reddy assured the Health Minister that he would rope in nearly 100 Telugu doctors settled in UK, Spain, Italy and USA, to coordinate in tele-medicine for COVID patients in Telangana. He said that those doctors have experience in handling thousands of coronavirus cases in those countries. Mr. Rajender appreciated the offer and asked DME Dr. Ramesh Reddy, DoH Dr. Srinivasulu and OSD Dr. Gangadhar to improve upon the proposal by meeting Narayan Reddy. Speaking to the media earlier, Mr. Narayana Reddy demanded the government to act fast on plasma therapy as it was giving better results in treatment of critically-ill COVID patients. Two persons, who have recovered from COVID, could donate their plasma to save one serious patient suffering from coronavirus, Mr. Narayan Reddy, who himself recovered from COVID, said. He added that many states have done commendable jobs in implementing plasma therapy. While the Delhi government is establishing a Plasma Bank, Maharashtra government has launched the biggest plasma trial titled ‘Project Platina’. Some other states including Karnataka, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh have been using plasma therapy in an effective manner to treat patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/telangana-plasma-donors-association-formed/article32108365.ece

17 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Don’t politicise OGH issue: Eatala to Oppn||Health Minister Eatala Rajender has asserted that the government was committed to provide best of services to COVID patients and has initiated several measures to check the virus spread. The Minister advised opposition parties not to ‘politicise’ issues for politics sake as this could affect the morale of the people/agencies working in the larger interest of the State. The Minister took strong objection to the Opposition criticism on water entering the Osmania General Hospital buildings following heavy rain on Wednesday. He recalled that the TRS government had proposed construction of new complex for OGH in 2015 itself, but the Opposition parties including the BJP, Congress, AIMIM and Left opposed the proposal on the floor of the assembly. Coupled with this was the resistance from historians and societies engaged in protection of heritage structures which delayed the construction of new complex. The government was forced to set aside its proposal to construct a new complex for the OGH temporarily following the pressure mounted by the opposition and instead took up repairs to the existing structure. “The Opposition parties halted the process of construction of new OGH complex, but they are now criticising the government for the leakages/seepages into the old building,” he said. He explained that the representatives of the Directorate of Medical Education and Medical Infrastructure development Corporation had been deputed to inspect the premises and take relief measures to ensure that patients were not put to inconvenience. The team of experts which inspected the premises said that the underground sewerage channel from Begumbazar to Musi river was passing through Osmania hospital and a block in the channel resulted in overflow of water into the hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/dont-politicise-ogh-issue-eatala-to-oppn/article32108362.ece

He spoke to the media after visiting Osmania General Hospital (OGH) and interacting with patients and doctors following two days of flooding in the in-patient wards after the rains. Mr. Sanjay accused the government of having ‘utterly failed’ in providing proper medical facilities at OGH, which is also treating COVID-19 patients and demanded immediate repairs to the old hospital building as it caters to the poor and the downtrodden. The JP president reached the hospital along with city president and MLC N.

The move came days after party president Asaduddin Owaisi gave his samples for testing at the Government Unani Hospital in Charminar and also got an antigen test done at an Urban Primary Health Centre. Mr. Owaisi also directed corporators to facilitate testing for at least 500 persons in each ward. AIMIM legislators interacted with Mr. Rajender and told him about locations where there is a need to augment testing centres. A demand for three additional antigen testing centres was made at Chandrayangutta; Basti Dawakhanas in Kumarwadi, Tadlakunta and Millatnagar. They suggested government infrastructure such as community halls and playgrounds to double up as testing centres. For instance, seven community halls in seven constituencies represented by the AIMIM were suggested, and one playground each in Yakutpura and Charminar were sought to be utilised as testing centres. “For the past few days, we have been going round PHCs across neighbourhoods to evaluate the infrastructure and the response of people. There are many who have come out to get themselves tested. Certain places need more testing centres and there was a paucity of staff. All these were listed by our party MLAs and given to the Health Minister,” said an AIMIM functionary. Meanwhile, taking to Twitter, Mr. Owaisi said that the MLAs demanded that at least 1,000 RT-PCR tests be done per day in each testing centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mim-for-more-testing-hubs/article32108367.ece
17 July 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Go digital: SBI to customers||The State Bank of India (SBI), Hyderabad Circle, has appealed to its customers to minimise physical visit to the branches, in view of increasing number of COVID-19 cases among the staff and public. Instead, it wants them to use alternative channels to conduct transactions. Chief General Manager Om Prakash Mishra said that though the SBI Circle was taking all possible protective steps, cases of customers and employees getting infected by the virus were increasing. This was on account of the branches and loan processing cells servicing a large number of customers daily. This was despite the bank ensuring physical distancing at the branches, providing adequate quantity of hand rub sanitisers as well as masks, the CGM said. Thermal scanners and PPE kits were also provided to staff at branches that received higher number of footfall. Those in charge were instructed to provide safety equipment wherever required and the circle was also following the standard operating procedures (SOP) and guidelines issued by government and bank in this regard. Sources said about 120 employees of the Hyderabad Circle tested positive for COVID-19. Their contracting virus necesstiated the quarantine of co-workers, thereby in certain cases resulting in the temporary shutting down of the branch itself. While two employees succumbed to the virus, another was suspected to have contracted the virus when he died. He appealed to customers to visit branches only in extreme exigencies, as they risk contracting the virus. SBI had a bouquet of safe and secure digital products like YONO.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/go-digital-sbi-to-customers/article32108371.ece

More than 30 families from different villages were given accommodation under the Rehabilitation and Resettlement at Tunkibollaram in Mulugu mandal as three villages — Mamidyala, Bahilampur and Thanedarpally, and one tanda — Thanedarpally, got submerged. Though a majority of the oustees were allotted double bedroom houses as part of the package, those who fought for compensation under the Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act- 2013 (LA Act – 2103), were allotted houses constructed on 33 yards of the total 75 yards allotted to them. The single-room houses were constructed in a low-lying area. As a result, the rainwater entered inside on three occasions — May 8, June 10 and July 12 — and the oustees had to spend sleepless nights. As many as 22 families are residing in these houses. Right from the first incident on May 8, the oustees have been lodging complaints with the officials about their plight but the response was not at the expected level. “We were forced to leave our village on April 30 midnight and were dropped in these houses. Staying here is hell literally, and especially children and elders are affected the most when it rains. It’s not right on the part of the government to do like this. Do justice for us,” said a woman in a video recorded by local residents. “For the first time, water was pumped from the spot and then a canal was dug behind the houses. Next time, they laid gravel on the road. These houses do not have drainage connections as well. For every house, there are only pits. Now they are laying the drainage pipelines,” said D. Raj Kumar, one of the oustees staying in these houses. “We are taking all steps to ensure that water does not stagnate when it rains. The canal work has been completed while drainage work is in progress. The engineers from different departments made the assessments and constructed these houses,” said a revenue official on condition of anonymity.

17 July 2020||Alok Deshpande Mumbai,||First woman SEC of Maharashtra dies||Maharashtra’s first woman State Election Commissioner (SEC) and former IAS officer Neela Satyanarayan died on Thursday due to COVID-19. She was admitted to SevenHills hospital in Mumbai. She was 72. Known to be a no-nonsense bureaucrat, sensitive author and thinker, she had a reputation of being one who is always ready to listen and work out solutions for problems. The 1972-batch IAS officer was the principal secretary (textile) during the first Shiv Sena-BJP government led by Manohar Joshi, and had handled the issue of textile mill lands. She is believed to have told Mr. Joshi and other ministers of his Cabinet that if the government failed to attend to the problems of textile mill workers it could face adverse consequences. This resulted in the setting up of more than three committees, including one under Charles Correa, to study the issue. She also handled other important departments including, director general, Information and Public Relations; and additional chief secretary in Home and Revenue departments. Post-retirement she was appointed the first woman SEC. Apart from being a bureaucrat, Satyanarayan also authored books, wrote lyrics and composed music for films. Her books Vanava , Ek Purna Ek Apurna is admired by readers and critics. Her second book on her real-life experiences of raising a specially-abled son, created a flutter in the government and administration. Condoling her death, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari said, “In her demise, we have lost a dedicated officer and socially responsive thinker. I pay my deepest respects to the memory of late Smt Satyanarayan and pray God to give her family strength to bear the great personal loss.” Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said that her life was an inspiration to the youth, while Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said that the State has lost a humane and empathetic ex-officer. Maharashtra unit Congress president Balasaheb Thorat said she was a diligent official and a sensible writer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/first-woman-sec-of-maharashtra-dies/article32108315.ece
17 July 2020||CHANDIGARH,||Punjab govt. stopped mid-day meal, alleges Cong. MP Bajwa||Congress Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa on Thursday, in a letter to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, alleged that despite the Supreme Court directive urging States to continue with the mid-day meal scheme during the COVID-19 lockdown, State schools have not provided ration to 13 lakh students since April 15, 2020. Mr. Bajwa said initially foodgrain was delivered on to the doorsteps of the students for 24 days (March 23 to April 15), but after that no distribution has been done and no instructions have been given to the schools in this regard. He demanded that the Punjab government resume the mid-day meal scheme in schools immediately. However, School Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla in a statement said: “Most nutritious mid-day meal is being continuously provided to as many as 15.79 lakh students of government schools across Punjab.”  Teachers role lauded He added that “though the efforts have been hampered due to spread of COVID-19, the commitment and zeal of teachers have made it possible to tackle the situation”. Mr. Singla said that despite facing many odds due to the unprecedented pandemic, the teachers have been doing a commendable job in taking online classes, distributing books apart from foodgrains at the doorstep of every eligible student. The Minister said that 8,262.23 metric tonnes (MT) of foodgrains have been sent to the schools for delivery to students for the first financial quarter of academic session 2020-21. He added that for the second quarter (July 20-September 20), allocation of 11,974 MT have also been approved. Mr. Singla said: “Amount of Rs. 37.26 crore as cooking cost have already been sanctioned by the State government, which has to be transferred to the accounts of beneficiary students as per the guidelines laid by the Union government. As some students did not have any operative bank account, around Rs. 14 crore is lying with the respective schools.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/punjab-govt-stopped-mid-day-meal-alleges-cong-mp-bajwa/article32108322.ece

At least nine trucks from Afghanistan have left,” said Mr. Ashok Sethi, director of the Confederation of International Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Both Pakistan and India had suspended trade through the Attari-Wagah border in March this year to deal with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Sethi said Amritsar’s dry fruit and spices sectors that rely on trade with Afghanistan have already suffered a loss to the tune of not less than Rs. 45 crore, which includes traders loss, revenue loss at ICP and staff salaries during the past four months. “Resuming of trade has come as a big relief to businessmen here amid the prevailing gloomy economic scenario,” he said. “Local traders have already placed orders for dry fruits and fresh fruits and as soon as things get streamlined we are expecting 8 to 10 trucks daily from Afghanistan with goods consignments. With the festival season approaching the sentiment is upbeat among traders who are expecting good demand for dry fruits and spices in the coming days,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/traders-upbeat-over-resumption-of-business-with-afghanistan/article32108323.ece
17 July 2020||Mumbai,||Child-lifting rumour led to Palghar lynching: minister||The Maharashtra Crime Investigation Department’s (CID) charge sheets in the Palghar lynching case have stated that the incident occurred following a rumour about child lifters operating in the area, State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said on Thursday. The minister said it was unfortunate that some political parties had tried to give a communal colour to the incident and made efforts to divide people on religious lines over the lynching. The State CID on Wednesday filed two charge sheets in the case, one running into 4,955 pages and another spanning 5,921 pages, before the Judicial Magistrate First Class court in Dahanu taluka in Palghar district. After examining 808 suspects and 118 witnesses, the CID team has arrested 154 people and detained 11 juveniles in conflict with law in connection with the incident. On April 16, two religious leaders — Sushil Giri Maharaj (35) and Maharaj Kalpavrikshgiri (70) — and their driver, Nilesh Telgane (35), were lynched by a mob on suspicion of being child lifters while passing through Gadchinchale village in Palghar. They were travelling from Kandivali to attend the last rites of a Hindu spiritual leader, Ramgiri Maharaj, who had died in Surat. They couldn’t travel on the national highway due to lockdown restrictions and reached Gadchinchle village after taking a detour. The trio was taken into custody by the Palghar police and kept in a police van. A large mob then reportedly stopped their vehicle and dragged the three men out. Armed with sticks and rods, the mob attacked the men and killed them. Offences were registered in connection with the case at Kasa police station and the Palghar police began an investigation. On April 21, the Maharashtra government transferred the case to the State CID and its Kokan Bhavan unit started a probe into the incident. The accused have been booked under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code such as Sections 302 (punishment for murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 34 (common intention), 120B (criminal conspiracy), 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment). They have also been charged with relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act, the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Maharashtra Police Act, and the Maharashtra Damage to Public Property (Prevention) Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/child-lifting-rumour-led-to-palghar-lynching-minister/article32108317.ece
17 July 2020||Mumbai,||Congress objects to mention of only Sena, NCP in govt. ad||An advertisement given by the State government of Mahajob portal, recently launched to provide jobs to unemployed youth, has become the latest cause of friction among the three parties of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Maharashtra Youth Congress president Satyajeet Tambe on Thursday raised objection to a full-page advertisement issued by the State government, with photos of only Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders. “Is Maha jobs a scheme of Maha Vikas Aghadi government or of Shiv Sena and NCP? Why can’t the guidelines of common minimum program decided during the formation of Maha Vikas Aghadi are being followed? This is a simple question to a common Congress worker like me,” he tweeted. The advertisement carried photographs of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, Industries Minister Subhash Desai, Labour Minister Dilip Walse-Patil, Skill Development Minister Nawab Malik, and Minister of State for Industries Aditi Tatkare. Mr. Tambe said when the common minimum programme was formed, it was decided that government achievements would have representation from the Sena, NCP, and Congress. “In every government advertisement, there should be photographs of the CM, Dy. CM, and Congress Legislative Party leader Balasaheb Thorat. Why this norm was not followed?” he asked. Congress MP Rajeev Satav too pointed out the mistake and said that the State government is of an alliance and there should be a representation of all parties. Mr. Thorat, who is also the Revenue Minister, said Mr. Desai had himself called him and accepted that there was a mistake while giving out the advertisement. “It is true that the Congress was given no space but the mistake was accepted by the Industries Minister and the issue is closed now,” Mr. Thorat said. When asked about the Congress not getting importance, the minister said the Congress has held meetings with the Chief Minister and problems seem to have been solved. “We do not want to stretch the issue. But we expect that such an instance will not be repeated in future,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/congress-objects-to-mention-of-only-sena-ncp-in-govt-ad/article32108320.ece
17 July 2020||Mumbai,||Petition in HC on release of prisoners||The National Alliance of People’s Movements (NAPM) filed a petition in the Bombay High Court on Thursday, challenging the decision of the State-appointed high-powered committee to release prisoners, in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, which exempts those charged under special Acts. NAPM is a pan-Indian coalition of movements for social justice and democratic development. The petition said several prisoners are denied interim bail and emergency parole due to the conditions imposed by the committee. Even after the release of 10,000 prisoners across Maharashtra since March, prisons continue to be overcrowded. Over 1,000 prisoners and jail staffers have tested positive and four prisoners have succumbed to COVID-19, due to the impossibility of maintaining physical distancing in prisons. The petition sought to quash the decision of the committee and sought a direction from the court to release prisoners convicted with life imprisonment without insisting that they have already been released in the past at least twice either on furlough or parole. The matter will be heard before a Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Anuja Prabhudessai on July 17. On March 23, the Supreme Court took a suo motu cognisance of the COVID-19 infection in overcrowded prisons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/petition-in-hc-on-release-of-prisoners/article32108318.ece

They even entered the locker room, which was open, but could not take anything from there, and later fled with the cash kept on the counter. “The duo had come on bikes and were wearing masks and plastic gloves. We are investigating,” Pankaj Dahane, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone I, said. A case of robbery has been registered against the duo with the Koparkhairane police, who are scanning footage of CCTV cameras inside the bank and outside.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/duo-robs-navi-mumbai-bank-of-rs-416-lakh/article32108321.ece
17 July 2020||Pune,||HSC exams: pass percentage rises to 90.66; girls outshine boys||In what is becoming a continuing trend, girls outperformed boys yet again in the Class XII results declared in the State on Thursday. A heartening element in the results, delayed due to the raging COVID-19 pandemic, was a significant rise in the overall pass percentage figure of 90.66, which was the highest recorded in the last four years. The overall pass percentage figure of 90.66, announced by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) this time was significantly higher than 2019’s figure of 85.88 as well as 2016’s figure of 86.60, registering an increase in 4.78 percentage points. Last year’s overall pass percentage had been the lowest since 2016. Robust pass figure This year, girl students recorded a robust pass figure 93.88%, far outclassing the boys, of whom only 88.04% could clear the exams. Of the 14.13 lakh students who sat for the exams, conducted between February 18 and March 17, in 3,036 centres spread over nine HSC divisions in the State, a total of 12.81 lakh students have passed. As many as 7,78,168 male students and 6,35,519 female students had appeared for the exams, of whom 6,85,066 male and 5,96,646 female students cleared the exams. The science stream recorded a pass percentage of 96.93 — an increase in nearly four percentage points as compared to 92.60% last year. The arts stream, too, recorded a significant rise of more than six percentage points, with 82.63% students clearing, as compared to 76.45% who had passed in 2018. Likewise, the commerce stream recorded an increase of almost three percentage points, with 91.27% students clearing the exams, as compared to 88.28% students who had passed last year. The pass percentage for vocational candidates this year was a healthy 86.07 as opposed to that of 78.93 last year — a tremendous increase of nearly eight percentage points. A total of 93.57% of the handicapped students who appeared this time successfully cleared their exams — a marginal increase compared to 92.60% who had cleared last year’s HSC exams. The Konkan division, where the least number of students appeared (30,143), notched up the ‘highest’ pass percentage in the State among the nine HSC divisions, recording 95.89%. The Pune division — where 2.4 lakh students appeared — recorded a robust pass percentage figure of 92.50. The Mumbai division, where the maximum number of students appeared (more than 3.13 lakh), improved its pass percentage with 89.35% students clearing the exams, as opposed to its 2019 pass percentage figure of 83.84. The Mumbai division ranks the ‘third lowest’ among the nine HSC divisions. Dubious honour This time, the Aurangabad division, where 1.58 lakh students appeared, had the dubious honour of recording the ‘lowest’ pass percentage figure of 82.51. Nagpur, which had come ‘lowest’ last year, notched up a creditable pass percentage figure this time of 91.65. The Nashik division (where 1.57 lakh students appeared) recorded 88.87% pass, below that of Mumbai, where the highest number of students appeared.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hsc-exams-pass-percentage-rises-to-9066-girls-outshine-boys/article32108485.ece
17 July 2020||Sonam Saigal Mumbai,||Vaze, others reinstated due to acute shortage of police personnel, HC told||A committee headed by the Commissioner of Police (CP) decided to reinstate 18 suspended personnel, including assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and three police constables accused of killing Khwaja Yunus in police custody, after many police personnel tested COVID-19 positive. This was stated in an affidavit filed by the Nawal Bajaj, Joint Commissioner of Police (Administration), in the Bombay High Court on Thursday. The affidavit was submitted in connection with a criminal petition filed by Asiya Begum (72) through advocate Chetan Mali to withdraw the revocation of suspension of four policemen accused of killing her son Yunus (27) in police custody in Powai in January 2003. In his nine-page affidavit, Mr. Bajaj said following a high court order, Sachin Vaze was suspended on March 3, 2004, and the three police constables on April 8, 2004. “The then CP decided not to conduct disciplinary proceedings against the delinquents since they are facing criminal prosecution in respect of the same case, relying on Rule 4.2 of the Departmental Enquiry Manual which states that it would be practical for the Disciplinary Authority to wait for the final outcome of the criminal case,” the affidavit read. It added, “The quarterly meeting for the review of the suspended policemen was held amidst the pandemic on June 5 wherein spread of the virus amongst policemen was a vital issue to be considered. The Committee was headed by CP and cases of all suspended police personnel were put up before the committee which included cases of API Sachin Vaze and three constables.” “Considering the overwhelming scenario of need of more policemen on duty, the committee decided 18 suspended personnel, in which guidelines followed by the review committee, were matched to resume duties. A circular dated October 14, 2011 issued by the Government of Maharashtra (General Administrative Department) which stated that depending on the facts and circumstances of the case where even after two years of filing a chargesheet before competent court, case is pending, the review committee may recommend to end the suspension of the delinquents and post them to non-executive branch. The four personnel were in continuous suspension for the last 16 years and they have been directed to resume service in view of the peculiar circumstances,” the affidavit read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/vaze-others-reinstated-due-to-acute-shortage-of-police-personnel-hc-told/article32108314.ece

17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||U.S. mulls travel ban on CCP members||The Trump administration is considering a sweeping ban on travel to the U.S. by members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and their families, according to people familiar with the proposal, a move that would almost certainly prompt retaliation against Americans seeking to enter or remain in China and exacerbate tensions between the two nations. The presidential proclamation, still in draft form, could also authorise the U.S. government to revoke the visas of party members and their families who are already in the country, leading to their expulsion. Some proposed language is also aimed at limiting travel to the U.S. by members of the People’s Liberation Army and executives at state-owned enterprises, although many of them are likely to also be party members. Details of the plan, described by four people with knowledge of the discussions, have not yet been finalised, and President Donald Trump might ultimately reject it. While the President and his campaign strategists have been intent on portraying him as tough on China for re-election purposes, Mr. Trump has vacillated wildly in both his language and actions on the Chinese government since taking office in 2017. He has criticised China on some issues, particularly trade. But he has also lavished praise on President Xi Jinping, pleaded with Mr. Xi to help him win re-election and remained silent or even explicitly approved of the repression in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Practical issues There are practical issues as well. The Chinese Communist Party has 92 million members. Almost 3 million Chinese citizens visited the U.S. in 2018, although the numbers have plummeted because of the coronavirus pandemic and the current ban on most travellers from China. The U.S. government has no knowledge of party status for a vast majority of them. So trying to immediately identify party members to either prevent their entry or expel those already in the U.S. would be difficult. The presidential order would cite the same statute in the Immigration and Nationality Act used in a 2017 travel ban on a number of predominantly Muslim countries that gives the president power to temporarily block travel to the U.S. by foreign nationals who are deemed “detrimental to the interests of the United States.” The 2017 ban was fought in the courts and expanded this year. Such a broad ban would be the most provocative action against China by the U.S. since the start of the trade war between the two countries in 2018. It would further poison U.S.-China relations, even after several years of open clashes over economics, technology and global influence have led some diplomats and analysts to draw comparisons to a new Cold War. Officials at the White House, State Department and Department of Homeland Security have been involved in the discussion over the ban. Spokesmen for the White House National Security Council and the State Department declined to comment Wednesday.NY Times||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-mulls-travel-ban-on-ccp-members/article32108025.ece
17 July 2020||London,||‘IS bride’ can return to U.K. to appeal citizenship removal||A woman who had her U.K. citizenship revoked after travelling to Syria to join the Islamic State group should be allowed to return home to challenge the decision, a court ruled Thursday. Shamima Begum, 20, lost the first stage of her case about the legality of the government’s decision at the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) in February. But the tribunal also ruled she could not have a “fair and effective appeal” or play “any meaningful part” in the process, as she was living in a Syrian refugee camp. Three senior judges at the Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld that SIAC ruling. “Ms Begum should be allowed to come to the United Kingdom to pursue her appeal albeit subject to such controls as the (home secretary) deems appropriate,” they said. Begum was 15 when she and two other schoolgirls from Bethnal Green in east London left home to join the jihadist group on February 17, 2015. The British-born Begum claims she married a Dutch convert soon after arriving in IS-held territory. She was discovered, nine months pregnant, in a Syrian refugee camp in February last year. Her newborn baby died soon after she gave birth. Two of her other children also died under IS rule. The then-home secretary, Sajid Javid, annulled Begum’s British citizenship on national security grounds after an outcry led by right-wing media. That prompted her to take legal action, arguing the decision was unlawful, made her stateless and exposed her to the risk of death or inhuman and degrading treatment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/is-bride-can-return-to-uk-to-appeal-citizenship-removal/article32108013.ece
17 July 2020||PESHAWAR,||Minorities under attack as PM pushes ‘tolerant’ Pakistan||It’s been a tough month for religious minorities in Pakistan, and observers warn of even tougher times ahead as Prime Minister Imran Khan vacillates between trying to forge a pluralistic nation and his conservative Islamic beliefs. A Christian was gunned down because he rented in a Muslim neighbourhood in northwest Peshawar, not far from the border with Afghanistan. Another Christian, pastor Haroon Sadiq Cheeda, his wife and 12-year-old son were beaten by their Muslim neighbours in eastern Punjab and told to leave their village. The attackers screamed “you are infidels”. An opposition politician was charged this week with blasphemy after declaring all religions were equal. A senior political figure, allied with the government and backed by Islamic extremists, stopped construction of a Hindu temple in the capital Islamabad. Analysts and activists blame an increase in attacks on an indecisive Mr. Khan. They say he preaches a vision of a tolerant Pakistan where its religious minorities thrive as equals among an overwhelming Muslim majority. They say that at the same time he cedes power to extreme Islamic clerics, bowing to their demands and turning to them for the final say, even on matters of state. “Imran Khan no doubt wants a more tolerant Pakistan, wants more accommodation for minorities, but the problem is he nullifies all of this by empowering extremist elements, so much so that it seems they can dictate to the state,” said Zahid Hussain, analyst and author of two books that track militancy in the region. Phone and text messages left with Mr. Khan’s spokesman were not immediately returned. The spokesman for Mr. Khan’s Religious Affairs Ministry, Imran Siddiqui, dismissed complaints that minorities have reason to be concerned. He said in every religion, there are “aggressive” clerics but neither Pakistan nor the Prime Minister were unduly pressured by them. Khan’s concessions Still, Mr. Khan’s list of concessions to the radical religious is lengthy. When the coronavirus first emerged as a threat, Mr. Khan refused to shut down a gathering of tens of thousands of Islamic missionaries from across the globe. It wasn’t until they had reached Pakistan that he ordered it cancelled. When Saudi Arabia closed its mosques and made the historic decision to cancel the Islamic pilgrimage of Haj to the faithful outside its borders, Pakistan refused to close its mosques after religious clerics vowed to take to the streets. Mr. Khan hadn’t been in office more than a few months when he buckled to extremists and fired a minority Ahmadi Muslim from his economic commission despite his stellar qualifications. When his political ally and speaker of the Punjab Provincial Parliament Pervez Elahi denounced the construction of a Hindu temple in the capital as being against Islam, Mr. Khan turned to the Council of Islamic Ideology to let it decide if public money can be used for its construction. He had promised $600,000 for its construction. Mr. Khan isn’t the first politician to walk a religious tightrope in Pakistan. Successive military and elected governments have buckled to the pressure of Islamic extremists, who critics say terrorise with their ability to bring impassioned mobs on to the street. “It’s the fear of the establishment as to what they can do. They can cause mayhem across Pakistan,” said human rights activist Tahira Abdullah.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/minorities-under-attack-as-pm-pushes-tolerant-pakistan/article32108018.ece

One helicopter crashed when returning to base from another drill, killing the pilot and co-pilot, the Army said. The cause of the crash was under investigation. The drills were part of a five-day annual exercise that ends Friday. Assault helicopters launched missiles and fighter jets dropped bombs on targets at sea, while tanks and missile trucks fired from a beach to deter a simulated invading force. "We want the world to see our determination and efforts to protect our country.” President Tsai Ing-wen said, observing the exercise in a helmet and camouflage military fatigues. China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province that is part of its territory. The self-governing island of 24 million people lies 160 kilometers (100 miles) off China’s southeast coast across the Taiwan Strait.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/taiwan-holds-military-drills-against-potential-china-threat/article32108022.ece
17 July 2020||London,||British Navy submarine in ‘near-miss’ with ferry||A British nuclear-powered submarine narrowly avoided crashing into a passenger ferry between Northern Ireland and Scotland, with disaster averted only because an officer spotted its periscope, a report revealed on Thursday. The government’s Marine Accident Investigations Branch called for an independent review into the incident on November 6, 2018, saying it was the third such near-miss involving a Royal Navy submarine in four years. The Stena Superfast VII ferry, carrying 215 passengers and 67 crew, was travelling between Belfast and Cairnryan on the west coast of Scotland when a lookout spotted the submarine’s periscope close by. “The officer of the watch then took immediate and effective action, turning the ferry to avoid a genuine risk of collision with a submerged submarine,” said the chief inspector of marine accidents, Andrew Moll. The submarine, from the Faslane naval base west of Glasgow, was conducting pre-deployment safety training at the time, and detected and tracked the ferry including with sonar data. “Although there was no collision, this was the third accident or incident between a dived Royal Navy submarine and a surface vessel in four years, which is a matter of significant concern,” Mr. Moll said in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/british-navy-submarine-in-near-miss-with-ferry/article32108014.ece
17 July 2020||Amman,||Jordan court dissolves Muslim Brotherhood||Jordan’s top court has dissolved the country’s branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Islamist movement, an official said on Thursday, citing the group’s failure to “rectify its legal status”. “The Court of Cassation yesterday (Wednesday) issued a final verdict ruling that the Muslim Brotherhood group is dissolved... for failing to rectify its legal status under Jordanian law,” the official said, requesting anonymity. The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928, is a pan-Islamic movement with both charitable and political arms. It has faced years of pressure, especially in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, and has been outlawed as a “terrorist” group in Egypt and banned in several other countries. Amman had tolerated the group’s political arm for decades, but since 2014 authorities have considered it illegal, arguing its licence was not renewed under a 2014 law on political parties. It continued to operate, but its relations with the Jordanian state deteriorated further from 2015 when the government authorised an offshoot group, the Muslim Brotherhood Association. In April 2016, security services closed the Brotherhood’s Amman headquarters and several regional offices, transferring their ownership to the splinter group. The original Brotherhood took the case to court in a bid to retrieve the properties, but the court in its verdict ordered it dissolved.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/jordan-court-dissolves-muslim-brotherhood/article32108016.ece

But the final straw appeared to be a Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally last month that drew an unexpectedly low crowd of about 6,200 people after Mr. Parscale had bragged that more than a million people had requested tickets.

17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Predictions, pandemics and public health||Human beings have two remarkable traits, the second of which we had little reason to suspect that we possessed until the rise of new technologies such as the Internet. The first is the capacity to anticipate events and tendencies, map their future in the short, mid, and long term, and act accordingly. We can, of course, go wrong, and so there is always an element of risk in making decisions on the basis of the exercise of such anticipatory gifts that we possess. Nevertheless, to a considerable extent, such exercises are a great potential asset. The second is a trait which, as I said, I did not know we possessed until a few decades ago. I’m not sure what the best word for it is. Perhaps it should be ‘cognitive generosity’. I stress cognitive deliberately to contrast with ‘material’. Someone who has never given a penny to Oxfam, say, or indeed even to a beggar, will put down every little thing he knows on the Web, for the world to read and share in the knowledge. She has found an effective way to remove ink stains from clothes. She will post it on some website. He has made a delicious biryani. He will post the recipe. The humblest of knowledges and we seem to want to share it with the world. If this really is a trait, it must be the product of evolution, but it took the technology of the last few years to trigger it in us. Combining the two traits Now, if we combine these two traits — the remarkable capacity for decisions and actions on the basis of anticipatory knowledges and the disposition to be generous and share the knowledges we have — we should have been able to pre-empt or, at the very least, to fairly quickly contain the pandemic with which we are now faced. The striking genomic similarity of the novel coronavirus with SARS is now well known and many who had studied SARS had anticipated the inevitability of more contagious pandemics than SARS in the offing and had sounded the alarm for the whole world to know and act upon the knowledge. Yet no one did. Why? The answer is quite obvious. There is no quick profit in public health issues of this preventive kind. If one tenth of the anticipatory gifts we have that seem to be exploited for immediate private gain on the part of corporations and investment bankers were put to use in the preventive domain of public health, not only would the crisis that we have been landed in be swiftly contained, it might even have been pre-empted by suitable medical safeguards. It would be glib to conclude from this that the two remarkable dispositions we possess which I mentioned at the outset are no match for the human disposition to greed. The eventual resting point of analysis cannot just be to record the contest between conflicting human dispositions, but to explore the extent to which the conflicting dispositions can be enhanced or undermined by institutions. Thus, for instance, no less a site than the White House institutionalised our dispositions to act on our anticipatory knowledges by setting up an office called ‘Predict’ intended as an early warning system for pandemics, with a view partly to aiding foreign countries that are pre-conditioned to be most vulnerable. President Donald Trump shut it down just a few months before COVID-19 hit the news — yet another symptom of how much we have allowed our political economy of some four decades to institutionalise and channel almost all of our dispositions, including the capacity to act intelligently on anticipatory knowledge, for private rather than public gain. So, human dispositions can be directed in all sorts of ways by the economic and political institutions we construct and entrench. But, equally, if it is we who construct and entrench these institutions, it is we who can dismantle (or re-mantle) them. Perhaps the one clear lesson of the current pandemic and our utter failure to act on the anticipatory knowledges that had been posted far and wide by knowledgeable people is that no re-mantling short of the public ownership of health care and pharmaceuticals will suffice. Someone may agree with this last remark but deny the stronger thing I am claiming. Scientists and public health officials didn’t really predict the pandemic, it might be said. It was more like saying that there is bound to be an earthquake in a certain region in the coming years. That is not a prediction. A prediction surely must identify a more specific time, as, say, of a solar eclipse. And so, even though there are very good reasons for having a public health care system, the fact that it will help to control the spread of (and even perhaps prevent) a pandemic could not have been expected to be one of the reasons considered for proposing a good public health system, where it is missing (in the United States, or India, say). An arcane distinction The facts simply belie this scepticism. First of all, we do use the word ‘predict’ in far more informal ways than is being suggested here. I may, for instance, quite properly say, without doing any violence to the linguistic norms around the word ‘predict’, about someone I know very well, ‘I predict that he will return from Oxford to the job we have kept open for him in our department at Columbia University’, without giving any precise specification of when he will return. And second, I don’t deny that there is a distinction between 1) Effectively controlling the spread of a pandemic is one of the many reasons we would and should consider for proposing a good public health care system, and 2) Were there a good public health care system, it would effectively control the spread of a pandemic. You can believe in 2) without believing in 1). But given the highly detailed warnings that were given by scientists after SARS of its anticipated offshoots that would be both highly contagious and lethal (a combination of properties that was not standardly true of the influenzas and other viruses of the last many years) and the urgent need to prepare for it — again with highly detailed suggestions about the development of cluster vaccines, production and distribution of medications, hospital equipment such as respirators, accessories such as masks, etc. — the distinction between 1) and 2) is academic and arcane. Those who did not consider the need to control the spread of an anticipated pandemic as one among the other good reasons to have a good public health care system where it is missing were simply insouciant.

17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Should the Gandhis disengage from the Congress?||The Rajasthan political crisis has once again highlighted an age-old problem afflicting the Congress Party — the power tussles between the old and the young. It has also raised questions on the ability of the Gandhis to hold the grand old party together. In a discussion moderated by Varghese K. George , two Congress leaders — Rajeev Gowda and Kumar Ketkar — discuss the role of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty and the future of the party. Edited excerpts:  There is a view that the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty is, actually a drag on the Congress Party.  Rajeev Gowda (RG):Not at all. The family has a tremendous role to play in leading the Congress Party forward and they have led the party through the ups and downs over the last few decades. Now, [there are] two things you must remember: one is the fact that across the entire length and breadth of the country, there is support for the Congress; and second is the fact that there is tremendous faith and trust among the people for the Nehru-Gandhi family. And, this is not just because of their dynastic connections, it is also because they have walked the talk on social justice, compassion and secularism. So, basically, we are very, very happy overall. And, we all realise that the party is going through tough times. We have to strengthen their hands rather than asking them to abandon the ship. All these qualities may have worked for the Congress at some point, but may not be relevant today. That is the criticism. Kumar Ketkar (KK):It is presumptuous to say that it is not working now. Who decides that? Not some liberal intellectuals or media commentators. In 1998 and 1999, the Congress lost. And therefore, in 2004, everyone was asking: how could Sonia Gandhi, a person who can’t even speak Hindi, become Prime Minister? Current-day critics may have good intentions, but I think the perceptions are totally wrong, misplaced; they don’t understand what is happening on the ground. The tremendous sympathy and love and affection that the family enjoys is beyond what they can do. It is not a question of success and failure. It is a question of heart and mind and soul and they have that relationship with them. But it is difficult to argue that the family is as popular as it used to be. RG:I would not say it has anything to do with the family, per se. I think the party is going through a stage where a former president has stepped aside, and we have an interim president arrangement, and then, there have been other disruptions such as the lockdown. KK:Electoral results cannot be the only mark of efficiency. No other family has taken a firm stance on secularism, democracy and liberalism like they have. The basic fact is that the Congress is the only party which fights for secularism and the family is the fundamental symbol of the secular and democratic principle. Is the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty more popular in the south than the north? RG:You go to any village in India, you will find Congress supporters. But your point is also valid. If you draw a line from Kanniyakumari to Kashmir, west of that line, the Congress has a strong organisation/government in some of the States. To the right of that line, including southern States, we are weaker. In Tamil Nadu, there is a lot of affection for the Nehru-Gandhis but we are not organisationally strong. Some of it has to do with organisational strengthening, which is required. And you must [also] admire the fact that Priyanka Gandhi has taken up the most challenging task which is in Uttar Pradesh. People who have been very loyal to the Nehru-Gandhi family are leaving the party. Do you think that is a failure of the family to keep them sufficiently inspired? KK:Well, that is a wrong perception. Sachin Pilot was elected as MP at the age of 26. And now he is 42. In between, he was a Cabinet Minister, a Central Minister, and a Deputy Chief Minister. He was, he is, very much a respected leader in the party. Has he come out and said that he does not accept the secular-liberal democratic line that the Nehru-Gandhi family has taken? Is he objecting to the ideological position or is he objecting to the organisational structure? People talk about Jyotiraditya Scindia. He had a tremendous responsibility to rebuild the party in Madhya Pradesh. But he lost his own constituency, Guna. It is the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is more obsessed with the so-called ‘dynasty’; I would prefer to use the word ‘family’. In dynasties, you never lose power. The BJP wants to finish the [ideology of the] Nehru-Gandhis because they know that the strength of the Congress is in the Nehruvian thought and the family represents it. But why are these people leaving the Congress Party in such large numbers? KK:That happens because personal ambition becomes more important than the party or the ideology. Is it that the so-called aspirational generation doesn’t have any ideas, doesn’t have any ideology? It has only aspirations and no ideology? It is not as if the masses are following them out of the Congress. RG:Let’s make this clear: Mr. Pilot has not left the party. If they [younger leaders] had asked me, which they haven’t, I would have said, ‘why don’t you wait for your time?’ You know, you [Pilot, Scindia] are both in States where the Congress is strong, where it has the opportunity to come to power again. And you guys are in your 40s, when the other seniors who are currently holding office are in their 60s and 70s. Is there a tussle between the ‘old guard’ and the new generation that is making the party dysfunctional? RG:I don’t see that. The people we spoke about, they may have reacted a little too hastily to what I would call ‘normal politics’. Normal politics is a situation where people are constantly competing; we are all in the same party, but that doesn’t mean that we don’t necessarily compete within the party. While competing with our political opponents and ideological opponents, there is competition within the party too. And so, you need to figure out ways to choose which battles to fight and which ones to avoid. And, how do you consolidate your own position? And, sometimes, you let others get ahead. You need to be marathon runners, I would say. Unlike the BJP, the Congress has no coherent ideology and that makes it entirely dependent on the family. The disarray in the family becomes the biggest weakness of the party hence… KK:To say that the BJP-RSS has a large organisational base is not true, it is a media creation. Secondly, the RSS has been shifting its political positions frequently. But they have an ideology unlike the Congress.  KK:I think their ideological stance has been changing according to their political positions and political opportunism is what determines that identity. [Their] organisational strength is much of a chimera, it is much of a myth. The organisation is there, but the Congress cannot be compared with the RSS. The Congress is loose; it should not be so loose, but it cannot have an organisation like the RSS, which is fascist in nature. Congress is a loose liberal democratic platform. This loose organisation, at some point used to be the key strength of the Congress. Do you think that it is also now dragging it down? RG:See, the Congress’s ideology is not narrow. It is you know, we’ll hear phrases like the ‘big tent’. We calmly do multiply voices. We do respect the fact that there are multiple ideological streams that contend and we reject those viewpoints which are focused on dividing Indians, especially on the basis of religion, which is what the BJP stands for. But the fact of the matter is that the kind of tolerance and the broad approach that the Congress has historically taken [is] that a looser ideology is actually what represents the essence of India. And what India will come back to. Is Rahul Gandhi a reluctant inheritor of family legacy? Do you think he is a reluctant politician in the sense that he does not remain consistently engaged with a political battle?  KK:That you can say in the sense that Rahul Gandhi is not a 24x7 politician like Mr. Modi is, or many others are; he has a different kind of personality and he has a different kind of approach, but I think it is also the more introspective qualities [that you should consider]. Mr. Gandhi has not been going directly to the masses as Indira Gandhi or even Sonia Gandhi did. RG:Rahul Gandhi is not power-hungry, like you’re seeing on the other side. The desire to gain power by any means that has undemocratic outcomes — in Goa, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, where the BJP has been defeated. They are so hungry for power, they essentially undermine democracy, bribe their way through and destabilise elected governments. Right? That kind of power hunger is what you need to be, as a media representative, out there calling out and criticising. And instead, you are expecting that our leaders who are much more focused on India’s future should be demonstrating the same kind of negative greed for power; that’s not what Rahul Gandhi is all about. And, people will realise his value and the fact that he represents the Indian ethos; we do our duty without worrying about the fruits. What should the family be doing differently for it to revive the Congress?  RG:One of the things that the lockdown has taught us is that technology allows us all to communicate wherever we are. The party leadership needs to find ways to communicate and engage well with the length and breadth of India, with every Congress person out there. Ms. [Sonia] Gandhi, our president, just had a virtual meeting. And in Karnataka, we had an inauguration of a new party president, D.K. Shivakumar, where we got every panchayat to participate in the ceremony virtually. So, these sorts of things can be scaled up. And it is a new possibility; even in a big national convention, only so many people get in to the actual event. And, here is an opportunity for us to try and engage with many more. KK: The first thing that the Congress should do is to see that those people who come to Congress only for power, the leadership has to identify and keep them away from the organisational and political work and do this political work directly, which is itself an ideological work. [Sometimes] those who talk more, or show themselves more in the media, get identified as the people who represent Congress. They don’t. So, some of the Congressmen are the people responsible for the decline of the party, not the family.  No other family has taken a firm stance on secularism, democracy and liberalism Kumar Ketkar, MP, Congress||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/should-the-gandhis-disengage-from-the-congress/article32108011.ece
17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||The lost voice of the Indian university||In the 19th and 20th centuries, Indian universities emerged as institutions where a privileged generation of colonial subjects trained to serve the colonial regime and further Western political ideals. Some graduates went on to serve the colonial state, while others contributed to the nationalist movement. Reforming higher learning In the 20th century, the growth of nationalism, liberal education and the process of de-colonialisation offered universities with an opportunity to revise the curriculum and to define new goals. Over the years, these institutions gradually discarded their elitist character and became more representative. In the initial decades after Independence, the government was conscious of various social, economic and financial challenges. It strongly supported these institutions, encouraging them to further develop an academic rigour that would shape a new generation and contribute to the nation-building process. The Indian Institutes of Technology and Indian Institutes of Management along with other distinctly envisioned institutions of academic excellence like the Indian Institute of Science, Indian Statistical Institute, and Jawaharlal Nehru University emerged as model institutions that defined the new academic ethos and the vigour of the modern Indian nation. The institutional and academic autonomy offered to these institutions was central to their emerging as premier institutions of higher learning in India. Other universities in India also took the lead, revised curricula and set about the task of reforming the university as a space for healthy academic engagement. These changes were marked by the growing importance of various large representative institutional bodies like faculty committees, committees of courses, board of studies, university senates, academic councils and executive councils. These bodies oversaw the administrative and academic functioning of the university and ensured a collective decision-making based on serious academic deliberation. It was here that academicians contested each other’s claims over ideological positions, scholarly beliefs, collectively shaped curricula and defined the fertile learning space that these institutions of higher learning espouse. This healthy scholarly debate shaped the process of nation building in independent India. It inspired individuals who went on to contribute to the growth of the economy, politics and shaped various social movements that transformed the nation in the first 50 years of the republic. A new intellectual regime From 2005 onwards, these changes that infused a new vigour in institutional academia were undermined by government policy that displayed an eagerness to impose a new intellectual regime. The constitution of the National Knowledge Commission and a very strong emphasis on privatisation of education undermined the deliberative and independent character of these institutions of higher education. Administrative and academic decisions were imposed from above and discussions within various academic bodies were discouraged. The imposition of the semester system across India and the introduction of a four-year undergraduate programme in many public and private universities were hallmarks of this new era of bureaucratic centralisation. The government of the day undervalued the academic achievements of scholars from Indian universities, romanticised American academia and undermined all the progress, new academic traditions and culture that had shaped Indian universities since Independence. It justified governmental intervention arguing that Indian academia had stagnated. Those in positions of authority within the universities were encouraged to undermine academic bodies and limit their role in revising and regulating matters pertaining to curricula, teaching and academic life in their institutions. These changes made it possible for a new wave of governmental interventions starting in 2015. The imposition of the ‘cafeteria system’ associated with the Choice Based Credit System and renewed attempts to privatise higher education linked to an emphasis on rankings were highlights of this new thrust. It became apparent that the government’s desire for intervention now included the determination of minute details pertaining to academic curricula, the teaching-learning process and the parameters that governed academic research within the university. Academicians were disenfranchised of their role in designing curricula and their own academic work was removed from the regulatory gaze of peers to that of the government bureaucracy. During this period, the university emerged as an extension of government. Bureaucratic centralisation This trend intensified with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The manner in which the Central government and the University Grants Commission have imposed themselves on the daily functioning of all higher educational institutions (Central, State and private) represents a new government-oriented bureaucratic centralisation. Decisions about the conclusion of academic term, the modalities for evaluation and the conduct of the teaching-learning process have become exclusive government prerogatives overnight. The various academic bodies that had original jurisdiction over these matters and were being subjected to decisions by higher authorities in the last few years have, in the last few weeks, been made redundant. How and whether examinations are to be conducted has become an issue of contention between State and Central governments. The general public now no longer appeals to the administrators of these institutions. The university administration has been replaced by the Education Minister and his bureaucratic apparatus. In the last 15 years, the government and Central regulatory agencies have systematically transitioned from being external facilitators to becoming decision-makers within institutions of higher education. Many blame this on the growing tendency of delayed (in most instances absence of) decision-making in these institutions, but history shows that this is rooted in the aggressive interventionist policies of successive governments. At a time when global politics is undergoing a systemic transformation and being infused with new ideas, institutions of higher education, which ought to be fertile intellectual spaces that can inform and shape society, are increasingly being undermined in India. The time has come for institutions of higher education in India to recover their lost voice and restore the fertile academic space where ideas are discussed and debated rather than suppressed and dismissed.

17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Re-conquering Constantinople||Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, having lost Istanbul to the Opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) in local elections held a year ago and aware of his own maxim “Who rules Istanbul, rules Turkey”, has decided to re-enact the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople. The recent announcement that Hagia Sophia, the church-turned-mosque-turned-museum, will once again be converted into a functioning mosque exemplifies that strategy. Mehmet II, the Ottoman Sultan who conquered Constantinople in 1453 from the Byzantine emperor, had converted the most important symbol of Orthodox Christendom into a mosque to demonstrate who was the new ‘Lord of the Golden Horn’. This act was part of common practice in medieval times. The Grand Mosque of Cordoba, constructed in 784, was converted into a Catholic cathedral in 1236 when the capital of the Spanish Umayyad Caliphate fell to Christian arms. However, those were different times when the destruction and transformation of religious monuments were used as demonstrations of power and control. Unfortunately, such acts continue to take place even today as instruments either for shoring up the sagging popularity of regimes or acquiring power by advocating revenge for real or imagined historical injustices. Demand since 2002 A part of Mr. Erdogan’s conservative Islamist base had been agitating for converting Hagia Sophia into a mosque ever since his party came to power in 2002. But Mr. Erdogan had ignored the demand as long as the Turkish economy was booming under his leadership and he was receiving credit for dismantling the military dominated authoritarian power structure the Justice and Development Party (AKP) had inherited from its secular Kemalist predecessors. All this changed after his re-election for the second time in 2011 and especially from 2013 when the Gezi Park protests against the government’s decision to change the character of the iconic Taksim Square in Istanbul by building a mosque and installing Ottoman-style buildings brought large numbers of protestors onto the streets. Mr. Erdogan’s decision to change the established parliamentary system to a presidential one passed by a thin majority of 51% to 49% in a referendum in 2017. This was an indication of how the wind was blowing. Mr. Erdogan did win the presidential election held under the new system in 2018, gaining over 52% of the votes. However, in the parliamentary elections held simultaneously, the ruling AKP received only 42% of the votes, down from 49% in the previous elections. These figures do not bode well for Mr. Erdogan for the next round of presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled in 2023. Mr. Erdogan’s authoritarian traits and his disregard for constitutional norms if not the letter of the law (which he constantly rewrites) have been clearly on display since the failed coup of July 2016. Thousands of civil servants and academics have been removed from their jobs and many of them imprisoned for their alleged links to the Gulenist movement. In recent years, the economy has also taken a nosedive. From a high of 11% in 2011, GDP growth dipped to less than 1% in 2019. The Turkish lira has fallen to approximately 7 to one U.S. dollar from a high of about 1.5 to one in 2011. These figures express the increasing unemployment and economic distress. Much of this is the result of economic mismanagement and Mr. Erdogan’s obsession with massive wasteful projects. The combination of severe economic downturn and Mr. Erdogan’s authoritarianism bordering on despotism has had a visibly negative impact on his popularity. Changing the character of Hagia Sophia is a part of his electoral strategy to revive his political fortunes by flaunting his commitment to rectifying perceived historical wrongs. Religio-nationalism is the last refuge of desperate politicians. This strategy has worked in some countries. One has to wait and see if it will work in Turkey as well.

17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Testing times||The Centre’s insistence, based on new University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines, that final year examinations in all universities and institutions be held in spite of the risk posed by COVID-19 is a needless complication in the national pandemic response. To expect large numbers of students to take a pen-and-paper test, or an online examination, or a combination of the two, as suggested by the UGC, is counterproductive. There is growing concern worldwide that the coronavirus infection is not always mild among young people, and more importantly, youth with mild symptoms might pass it on to older family members who could become seriously ill. The point, therefore, is not that the Centre is legally empowered to order the conduct of examinations by September-end, because higher education is in the concurrent list, but the likely harm that might follow. Also, in the unlock phase, States have been empowered to add restrictions to the Home Ministry’s orders on public activity, taking the local situation into account. Many large universities have shown commendable alacrity in devising alternatives to evaluate students in the present circumstances, including some academically rigorous technical universities. They have done away with a final examination and chosen a formula that uses best past performance of students. Given the incalculable risks involved, States such as Punjab, Maharashtra, Odisha, West Bengal and later Delhi decided against holding final year examinations. As the country with the third highest number of cases in the world — more than 1 million as of July 16 — the situation on COVID-19 in India is worrying. Any move to ram through a final examination scheme could endanger lives. The Centre must take its own advice, of restricting public movement and gatherings during the pandemic, seriously, and leave it to the States to determine the best course. In its defence, the Department of Higher Education has gathered data to show that 454 out of 640 universities had either conducted examinations or planned to do so, and the rest should fall in line because of the legal position. Such a hardline approach does not cohere with the imperative of a consensus pandemic response. It is relevant to point out that in the most affected nation, the U.S., major universities are placing health and safety first and academic enterprise next. Any decision to reopen institutions and conduct examinations requires careful assessment of local conditions, and is best left to the States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/testing-times/article32107992.ece
17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||For equal treatment||In holding that people suffering from disability are entitled to the same benefits and relaxations as candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes, the Supreme Court has recognised the travails of the disabled in accessing education or employment, regardless of their social status. Even though drawn from all sections of society, those suffering from the several categories of disability recognised by law have always been an under-privileged and under-represented section, a fact noticed in official studies in the past. Recently, the top court ruled that the Delhi High Court had correctly decided in 2012 that “people suffering from disabilities are also socially backward, and are therefore, at the very least, entitled to the same benefits as given to the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes candidates”. Therefore, it took the view that when SC/ST candidates get a relaxation of a certain percentage of marks to qualify for admission, the same relaxation shall apply to disabled candidates too. In the 2012 case before the High Court, a university had allowed a 10% concession in the minimum eligibility requirement for SC/ST candidates, and 5% concession for disabled applicants. The High Court ruled against this differential treatment, terming it discriminatory. The larger principle behind this was that without imparting proper education to those suffering from disabilities, “there cannot be any meaningful enforcement of their rights” both under the Constitution and the then prevailing 1995 legislation on providing equal opportunities to the disabled and protecting their rights. It can only be more applicable, now that a fresh law that aims for a greater transformative effect, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, is in place. A counterpoint to the idea of eliminating the distinction between the disabled and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes may arise from those questioning the attempt to equate physical or mental disability with the social disability and experience of untouchability suffered by marginalised sections for centuries. For instance, the social background of disabled persons from a traditionally privileged community may give them an advantage over those suffering from historical social disability. However, this may not always be the case. The Delhi High Court had cited the abysmally low literacy and employment rates among persons with disabilities. Educational indicators captured in the 2001 Census showed that illiteracy among the disabled was much higher than the general population figure. The share of disabled children out of school was quite higher than other major social categories. The 2001 Census put the illiteracy rate among the disabled at 51%. There was similar evidence of their inadequate representation in employment too. The 2016 law sought to address this by raising the quota for the disabled from 3% to 5% and envisaging incentives for the private sector to hire them too. It is vital that this is fully given effect to so that this significant segment of the population is not left out of social and economic advancement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/for-equal-treatment/article32107996.ece
17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||On meals enjoyed during field trips||With work from home becoming the new normal, one can only look back with nostalgia at all the long field trips one was privileged to take. Amidst the impeccably shot pictures of biryanis and banana bread on Instagram, there is a montage of the hungry hours that you spent on the roads and then the invaluable meals that came your way just when you were dipping into the bag for that one last Parle-G. It was the month of June, the temperature was hovering close to 50°C. I, along with a photographer, was at Bayana, in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur district, covering the Gujjar protest. We had been out in the field for nearly four days. Invariably, lunch had to be skipped, because the protest site was far out away from any eatery. I was trying to chase the man of the moment, Colonel Kirori Singh Baisala, for an interview. When I met him, he was just sitting down for lunch under a tree along with his advisers. Mr. Bainsala generously offered us a lunch of thick roti s made out of coarse grains, bitter gourd sauteed with tangy unripe mangoes, and kadhi (a curd and gram flour curry). Maybe it was hunger or heat, but that bitter gourd with mangoes tasted heavenly. In spite of many attempts, a similar fare prepared in my kitchen didn’t quite taste like the one I had at Bayana. During the Lok Sabha elections in Bihar, trailing a Left candidate, I was invited for a lunch organised by the villagers for the candidate. The invitation was so warmly and lovingly given then I couldn’t decline. The entire village was there. The campaign music blared from speakers. The children, sitting on their haunches, in not particularly hygienic surroundings, were eating with gusto. The lunch was served in an empty plot, as we sat on plastic chairs, someone came with steel thali s on which rice was slapped on, along with dal and potato- parwal fry. Curd was reserved only for a select few, scooped up with bare hands and poured into the thalis. Dhaba in Sukma More often than not you got food. But there were rare instances when after breakfast, you did not encounter food till sundown. Two years back, touring south Chhattisgarh ahead of the Assembly polls in the State, I along with a colleague drove down from Bastar; after making many stops, it was close to 4.00 p.m. when we reached Sukma. There was just a smooth road ahead and no sign of any eatery for a long distance. At one of the barricades, where we were stopped and our car thoroughly checked, my colleague asked the CRPF official about a possible place where we could grab food. He directed us to a dhaba that they frequented some km ahead. And there we found some lovely plump boiled rice, dal and a plateful of lightly sauteed beans. Being able to travel to different parts of the country is one of the rare privileges that journalism provides us. It is often not only about the news stories; these are life lessons that no classroom can teach you. The crash courses that you get on different trades, the flavours you get to relish which you won’t find in any restaurants, the nuggets of political wisdom and, above all, the warmth that only human-to-human contact can give. And for now all these are all on hold as most of the journalism is via phones and video calls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/on-meals-enjoyed-during-field-trips/article32108006.ece

She was answering questions at a press conference shortly before leaving for New Delhi after a three-day visit to the State [Jammu and Kashmir]. Asked what she thought would be the outcome of the 1972 elections, Mrs. Gandhi replied: “I have never prophesied. Let the elections come.” Asked whether the reported possibility of the Ruling Congress joining hands with the Akali Dal in Punjab did not militate against the party’s policies, she said that if her party could get together with anybody, “It will be only on the basis of what we believe in.” She did not think there was “anything grand” in the proposed alliance of the Congress (O) with the Swatantra and Jan Sangh. She said the alliance was disturbing in the sense that people, who were committed to the Congress ideology, should go over to those “who have been always opposed to us.” The Prime Minister observed that arms supplies to Pakistan by the U.S. and Russia “created strong public feelings here and interfered with our friendship”. But the Government had to take a wider view, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/mrs-gandhi-rules-out-mid-term-poll/article32108005.ece
17 July 2020||MANCHESTER,||England batsmen kept in check||England was 112 for three at tea after losing wickets at regular intervals on the opening day of the second Test against West Indies on Thursday. Opener Dom Sibley (46) and all-rounder Ben Stokes (18) added 31 runs for the fourth wicket as the host, put in to bat, trod cautiously in overcast conditions, with the lights switched on at Old Trafford, after a delayed start. The lunch break was bookended by a pair of wickets for all-rounder Roston Chase, who dismissed opener Rory Burns and Zak Crawley with his part-time off-spin. Chase trapped Burns leg-before for 15 at the stroke of lunch, while Crawley flicked his first ball straight to Windies captain Jason Holder at leg-slip. Steadying the innings England skipper Joe Root, who missed the first Test to attend the birth of his child, stitched a 52-run partnership together with Sibley to stabilise the innings. Paceman Alzarri Joseph returned after the drinks break to remove Root, who edged an outswinging delivery to Holder in the slip cordon. West Indies suffered a setback when seamer Shannon Gabriel left the field to get treatment on a reported groin issue.  England is without Jofra Archer after the fast bowler breached the team’s bio-secure protocols by going home to Brighton, while top order batsman Joe Denly was dropped to make way for Root. Mark Wood and James Anderson were also rested with Stuart Broad, Sam Curran and Chris Woakes named in the playing XI. West Indies, which won the first Test, named an unchanged team.  Playing XI:   England: Rory Burns, Dom Sibley, Zak Crawley, Joe Root (Capt.), Ben Stokes, Ollie Pope, Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes, Sam Curran, Dom Bess, and Stuart Broad.

The shooting range was opened for top shooters’ training on July 8, and after monitoring the progress thus far, the NRAI decided that it was time to resume training for all the 34 shooters in the core group. Cautious “The health and safety of the players and coaches is paramount. We are fully prepared to resume training in a cautious way,” said NRAI president Raninder Singh, in a statement. The Manav Rachna University campus, located close to the range in Faridabad, is expected to provide accommodation for the campers, including coaches and support staff. Nodal officer High Performance manager Ronak Pandit has been appointed as the nodal officer to coordinate the aspects of hygiene and medical protocol. “Among his responsibilities would be to ensure that all necessary safety precautions and guidelines related to COVID-19 are followed,” the statement said. Strict adherence Apart from the standard protocol, the NRAI is expected to make its own list of measures for strict adherence by all concerned.  The campers have to bring a COVID-19 test report from their home base, and will be kept in “quarantine-type conditions”. There is no option to skip the camp. Three other camps The NRAI is also planning to have three separate camps for the National core group of shooters in rifle, pistol and shotgun, both in the senior and junior sections. The National federation hopes to have bilateral competitions for the Olympic squad with the approval of the International Federation, the Union Government and the Sports Authority of India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/camp-for-olympic-core-group/article32108136.ece
17 July 2020||LONDON,||Arsenal scuttles Liverpool’s record bid||Arsenal capitalised on shocking errors from Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk and Alisson to beat the champion 2-1 at The Emirates on Wednesday and end its hopes of a record points tally for the Premier League season. The loss means Liverpool, on 93 points, can now only stretch that tally to 99, one short of Manchester City’s record. Good start, but... The visitors opened the scoring in the 20th minute when Sadio Mane lashed in his 17th goal of the season from close range.  The home side was handed a free pass back into the game 12 minutes later when van Dijk’s back pass went straight to Alexandre Lacazette and the Frenchman calmly rounded defender Fabinho and ’keeper Alisson to equalise. Later, Alisson attempted a chipped ball out to Andrew Robertson that Lacazette ran onto and pulled back to Reiss Nelson. The 20-year-old turned and shaped his shot into the bottom left corner.  The results:   Premier League: Arsenal 2 (Lacazette 32, Nelson 44) bt Liverpool 1 (Mane 20); Burnley 1 (Wood 90+5-pen) drew with Wolves 1 (Jimenez 76); Manchester City 2 (David Silva 6, Jesus 39) bt Bournemouth 1 (Brooks 88); Newcastle 1 (Ritchie 56) lost to Tottenham 3 (Son 27, Kane 60, 90).

Apparently, responding to media reports on Dutee offering to sell off her car to raise funds for training, the Odisha government also mentioned that Rs. 3 crore was given as financial assistance for the two silver medals she won in the 2018 Asian Games and Rs. 30 lakh for training and financial support during the 2015-19 period. “The State Government also appointed Dutee Chand as Group A level officer in the Odisha Mining Corporation (OMC) with a current salary of Rs. 84,604,” the release said. “The total financial support provided to Dutee from the State government/OMC is Rs. 4.09 crore since 2015,” the release said. It’s prize money Reacting to it, Dutee told PTI: “I am indebted to the Odisha government for supporting me all these years, but this Rs. 4 crore does not show the correct picture. The Rs. 3 crore is the prize money for winning two silver medals. It should not be considered as financial assistance for training.” She said she was no longer selling her car as the KIIT founder and Member of Parliament Achyuta Samanta has assured her financial support for her training. “I have been offered financial support by even Union Finance Minister (Nirmala Sitharaman) and sports minister (Kiren Rijiju).

17 July 2020||MUMBAI,||Vijay Hazare Trophy on chopping block||The BCCI’s apex council on Friday is set to discuss the structure of what could well be the shortest domestic season in Indian cricket this century.  Conventionally, the BCCI finalises the domestic calendar in July. But the pandemic has delayed matters. And with the risk associated with outdoor activities and the need for protecting player health, the apex council may well decide to severely curtail the number of domestic tournaments. December start targeted At the moment, the BCCI is hoping for approvals to start the domestic season in December. This means at least one of the three inter-State championships will have to be abandoned. Considering the focus on the Twenty20 format due to global championships, the Vijay Hazare Trophy (50 overs) could well be done away with for the forthcoming season. If the BCCI can start the domestic season in December, then the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (T20) will be followed by a shortened Ranji Trophy. Depending on the format finalised for the Ranji Trophy, only the multi-day tournaments for Under-23 and Under-19 — Col. C.K. Nayudu Trophy and Cooch Behar Trophy, respectively — will be planned. The apex council is likely to abandon the under-14 and under-16 boys’ inter-State tournaments. It will be interesting to see if it decides to revert to the old formula of under-15 and under-17 age-group cricket for the following season to not deprive youngsters of opportunities. Women’s cricket is set to suffer, with the possibility of only the under-23 and senior women’s one-day tournaments to be announced for the coming season. Meanwhile, it is highly unlikely that the apex council will decide the Ranji Trophy format. “It all depends on the window in hand, so it’s too early to go into the nitty-gritty. “The BCCI’s cricket operations wing has been coordinating with the private firm that has been involved in planning the domestic calendar,” said a BCCI insider.

17 July 2020||Chennai,||Five biomarkers of ovarian cancer discovered||Researchers at the Cancer Institute (WIA) have identified a panel of five protein markers in the blood that can help with an early diagnosis of a common and lethal form of ovarian cancer. The findings of the study have been published in the Journal of Proteomics . A patent application has been filed. “Early diagnosis of ovarian cancer has been a challenge; the purpose, therefore, is to identify plasma proteins differentially expressed in epithelial ovarian cancer patients,” the authors say in the paper. The team lead, T. Rajkumar, head of molecular oncology at the Cancer Institute, adds: “ About 85-90% of patients who have ovarian cancer have this variety, and the bulk of them come in at Stage III C, very advanced, and cure, then, is difficult.” The crude incidence rate for ovarian cancer in India is 5 to 6 per 1,00,000. Stage IIIC cancers account for nearly 75%, with survival among them being around 30-40%. Gynaecologist A. Jaishree Gajaraj explains the reasons for the delay in seeking help. “The symptoms of this cancer tend to mimic other gastrointestinal conditions — acidity, ascites or a bloated feeling. Even doctors don’t commission a gynaecological study at that stage. It is only when the patients progress towards respiratory problems that the first scan is done to test for a gynaecological origin to the problem,” she says. In the research, over 400 human plasma (derived from blood) samples, from patients with ovarian cancer, benign tumours and healthy subjects, were used. “We decided to look for biomarkers that would make a clear differentiation between cancerous and benign conditions,” Dr. Rajkumar explains. There were over 507 blood proteins that were expressed differently between healthy subjects and patients. Assessing proteins “Of this, 21 proteins were taken up for validation using an advanced technique called Quantibody array. In the second stage, nine proteins were assessed. Further, using the ELISA assays, a combination of five markers (CA125, IGFBP2, SPP1, TSP1 and ADI) emerged with 90.24% sensitivity and 94.87% specificity. This assay of five markers has the potential for early diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancers,” Dr. Rajkumar explains. “Now, we are in discovery mode. We need independent verification of the results,” he says. The team that worked on this research includes Amutha Periyasamy, doctoral student; Gopal Gopisetty, professor, department of molecular oncology; Malliga Joyimmallaya Subramaniam, associate professor, department of preventive oncology and Sridevi Veluswami, professor, department of surgical oncology, all at the Cancer Institute.

17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||More with less||Over three months into lockdown, many of us have learnt a few valuable lessons. And the lessons learnt from our kitchen are here to stay. With families huddled together, children attending online classes, and parents working from home, there has been more cooking in many households. Naturally, the waste generated in those kitchens are also of higher volume. Minimal food wastage has to be our focal point, especially these days when the aim is to get by with a few essentials. Chennai-based cookbook author Usha Prabhakar says that this is the right time for families to learn to lead a frugal life, and be aware and mindful of how to put kitchen waste to best use. In her book Usha’s Pickle Digest , published in 1998, Usha had dedicated a section for pickling peels and leaves. “We generally discard orange and lemon peels, unmindful of the fact that they are actually loaded with nutrients and various other vital minerals. The stem of the cauliflower is rich in sulforaphane, a plant compound with many beneficial effects,” says Prabhakar. Jeyashri Suresh, a Hongkong-based food blogger, says that even though she does not use vegetable peels to make any dish, fearing pesticide deposits, she does pay attention to reducing waste. She collects the centre, hard portion of the cabbage and unused portions of various vegetables, boils them to make vegetable stock, and this broth is used to make lemon coriander (using only the stem portions) soup. “We can also make bread soup with the trims of bread slices. When I steam raw plantain to prepare a dish called vazhakkai podimas (a dry curry with raw banana), I use the peel to make a delicious chutney. Recently, I got to know of a thogayal recipe that uses snake gourd pith,” Suresh says.  Green platter For food blogger Sharmila Ribero, collecting cauliflower stems, broccoli stems and all other stems and peels of vegetables and making a broth or stock is a routine these days. This broth is used as soup base. She says, “This is not only delicious but also nutritious. Similarly, we can use coriander stems and roots for chutney or gravies. I grind coriander and mint leaves into chutney and freeze and use.” Ribero suggests that families grow greens and herbs. “Basil, curry leaves, mint and coriander can be grown even in balconies. Growing microgreens using fenugreek and mustard seeds is even simpler. You can sow them in shallow trays in the kitchen and the harvest could be used in raitas and salads,” she says. Blender composting Organic waste generated in our kitchen can be put in a bin for composting, but this method takes many weeks and those who live in apartments may find the process difficult. Moreover, it is not easy to maintain it stench-free. “Which is why I recommend blender composting, a fantastic way to make use of kitchen waste to create your own nutrient-rich soil,” says Prabhakar. “It is a process of blending organic kitchen waste such as vegetable and fruit peel, egg shells and coffee grounds. But avoid dairy products (they will hinder the composting process) and meat as it might attract rodents,” she cautions before moving on to more details. “We blend the waste with water, in about one-fourth of the blender, to create a pourable liquid that can be fed to plants directly,” she adds. This mixture can be poured directly around the roots of big trees or poured in a pot with mud and allowed to compost. Blending significantly hastens the decomposition process: it takes less than 10 days to decompose, and there is absolutely no foul smell. With gardening gaining popularity during lockdown, this is a fast and efficient way to enrich the soil. Blender composting is convenient for apartment dwellers who want to make use of organic waste, but do not have the set-up to build a full-blown compost bin. Yet, they can create their own homemade organic compost in days instead of weeks, adds Prabhakar.  Blending significantly hastens the decomposition process: waste takes less than 10 days to decompose when blended, and there is no foul smell||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/more-with-less/article32108474.ece
17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Lunch box nostalgia||“The world is still in lockdown mode; I wonder when our children will be able to go back to school. Am sure they miss all the fun and frolic of the school environment, which is why I suggest that parents still pack different types of healthy snacks and lunch even when the children attend online classes,” says Uma Raghuraman, a food blogger and author, who is better known as Masterchefmom. Tiffin boxes at home, apart from making online learning more interesting, can also help children understand that nutritious food can be tasty. Moreover, this is a good time for parents to train their children to eat all types of fruits, vegetables and pulses, says Raghuraman over phone from Gurugram. “When I grew up in Chennai, the lunch box was such an important part of my school days, and continued well into my college years. I never shied away from carrying a wire koodai (wire basket) which had a two-tier stainless steel tiffin box and a huge water bottle. But the current generation prefers to tuck a slim lunchbox into their bag, and therefore even the lunch we pack has to suit that box,” she adds. “What is sad is that lunch hour in school is no longer that special time, when kids used to sit in circles and share their food and enjoy. The kids these days prefer to munch something quickly and get out to play. So parents invariably end up packing roti or paratha or some finger food.” Raghuraman was a novice at cooking when she got married 24 years ago. She gradually learnt the nuances from her mother-in-law and also from her mother. “My greatest inspiration is my husband, who is a big-time foodie and would go to any extent to explore good food across different cuisines. Those were the days when we did not have the Internet or social media, so I learnt new recipes from magazines and aunts. Another great source was the neighbours in the apartment; we all used to get together and learn a new dish and even bake. I was looking for novel ideas to pack tasty and nutritious lunch for my son and daughter, and that is how my interest in cookery grew,” Raghuraman says. Favourites then and now It was the aesthetics of her food photography, especially, that fetched her followers on social media. She says, “I launched my blog in 2014 and started posting on Instagram after a year. Right from 2014 I have been posting many lunch box recipes which were a big hit. I started experimenting and developing finger food and snacks which are high on nutritional value, and at the same time preferred by the kids, and also easy to prepare.” Raghuraman used to give a continental twist to the south Indian idli and dosa, by steaming idlis in muffin trays, making layered idli sandwiches and stuffed dosas. In a few years, her lunch box recipes touched 100: that is when a publishing company approached her with the idea of publishing them as a book. “It was during 2011-2014, while I was working as a teacher in kindergarten, that I began to closely observe eating patterns and preferences of kids, and I even used to observe what they bring and if they eat it or discard it. This further motivated me to research more on lunch box ideas,” says Raghuraman, who has been posting simple, minimum-ingredient recipes during the lockdown. Her recipes focus on doable, simple lunch box recipes, and top on the list are adai sliders, puran poli cup cakes, mango motak pie, kulcha pizza, pull-apart buns, pakoda waffle and upma cups to name a few.     My Genius Lunch Box, published by Penguin Random House, is available at Amazon.com and is priced   at Rs. 299.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/lunch-box-nostalgia/article32108477.ece

He takes it to Raksha, a wolf who has just had cubs. Raksha and her mate, Rama, adopt the baby and name him Mowgli. When Shere Khan, the man-eating tiger, comes to the jungle, Akela, the leader of the wolf pack, decides that Mowgli must return to the human village. Bagheera appoints himself as escort, but Mowgli doesn’t want to go. When they’re resting on a tree at night, Kaa the python tries to hypnotise Mowgli and eat him. But Bagheera puts a stop to it. Bagheera and Mowgli have a fight, which leads to Bagheera walking away in anger. Mowgli meets Baloo the bear who promises to teach him the ways of the jungle but is soon kidnapped by the monkeys. He is rescued by Baloo and Bagheera but Shere Khan hears of the boy and decides to look for him. Does Mowgli manage to defeat Shere Khan? Do Bageera and Baloo convince him to go back to the human village or does Mowgli insist on staying back in the jungle? Marching order The basic idea is drawn from Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Books. Walt Disney, who produced the film, famously told the scriptwriter not to read the book.  Walt Disney died during the making of the film, raising doubts about the future of the animation studio. But, the film was a smash hit and Walt Disney Studios went from strength to strength.  ‘Trust in Me’, the song sung by Kaa, in the film, had been written for the 1964 film Mary Poppins, which was also a Walt Disney production, but was not used then.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/jungle-beats/article32108714.ece
17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Off to the hills||Hello friends! I know it’s been a while since I last wrote to all of you, and I’m sorry that I just upped and disappeared there for a bit. Between you and me, I just wasn’t feeling so great. So, online school started a few weeks ago, and, in the beginning, it was really fun. I got to see my friends every day and chat with them, and it kind of felt like there was a purpose to the day again. Apart from finding 10 new ways to annoy the Pesky Brother, that is. And unlike ‘real’ school with all the classes crammed in one after the other, online school had a break after every class. And school finished at lunch time, with all post-lunch sessions ‘optional’. I don’t understand, which student would willingly sign up for extra, non-compulsory classes? But, after a few weeks, it wasn’t that great any more, you know? Seeing my friends on a screen reminded me how long it had been since I’d seen them for real. Setting up secret chat groups to send messages to each other made me realise how much I missed doodling on chits of paper and throwing it at someone in class. Working on projects online is not the same as working on one in someone’s house, and doing more time pass than the actual project. Alien invasion? In short, after a few weeks, I just didn’t want to do online school any longer. I really thought my parents would flip out when I told them, and say that I had no choice. But guess what? They said they understood! And that they felt that way too with all the work from home and Zoom meetings they’ve been doing. (In other news, I think my parents have been abducted by aliens. Who ARE these beings they’ve sent as replacements?) They said it’s called burn out, and that it’s a kind of mental exhaustion that some people have. So, they let me take a day off every now and then. It was kind of what I needed. To take a day off to sleep in, read, cycle, doodle and just not sit down in front of a screen. I then decided to write to the school about how I felt and, guess what? They’ve shared a student survey to see how many other kids feel that way, and maybe change the schedule a bit. The thing I learned from all of this is: if you’re not feeling great about something talk to someone about it. We’re off to the hills for the next few weeks, so the entire family can take a break from school and work and the pandemic. I’m not going to have a great WiFi connection, which means I won’t be able to write to all of you. So, it’s a few more weeks of no Bug Boy bugging you. But I’ll be back. Promise! Till then, stay safe, stay healthy, and, if you don’t feel so great, TELL someone!  Which student would willingly sign up for extra, non-compulsory classes?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/off-to-the-hills/article32108702.ece
17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Ch-ching!||The story so far: Rayu gets into trouble with Mr. Shetty for trying to take more money than what was promised to him.   I could only think of Mr. Shetty this morning. “I think I am sick,” I announced, after brushing my teeth. Pa touched my forehead. “You are doing fine. Get out of the house. I am not going to let you hatch eggs at home.” This is what happens when your parents are doctors and own a clinic. They get rattled by the lack of doctors, lab instruments, medicines and electricity; not by the threats of their pre-teens. Rani and I have attended school every day since it was opened. It was difficult to skip school. If we missed school even for a single day, my classmates were sure to visit me in the recess. I took my own time to get ready. Rani was angry. It was 11.00 by the time we reached Happy Home. I looked for Mr. Shetty in the corridor. He wasn’t there. But Mr. Kamal was leading a man into one of the rooms on the first floor.  Another reading session “I have been waiting for you,” said Mr. Kamal. “Why?” I asked. “I heard you read out the newspaper to Mr. Shetty yesterday.” I squirmed and looked at my shoes. “Mr. Purshottam will be with us for a month. He has undergone an eye operation. Will you read the newspaper to him?” Rani grinned and made her way to meet Mrs. Charumathi. Mr. Kamal handed over the newspaper to me and scooted, leaving me stranded with Mr. Purshottam. We walked to the empty dining hall and I read out the paper just like Mr. Shetty had taught me the other day — all the headlines in the ascending order. At the end, Mr. Purshottam gave me a hundred rupee note. I gave it back to him. “It’s a hundred rupee note.” “Oh, keep it. It’s a reward for your honesty,” he said. My eyes popped. What a change of luck. I didn’t want to appear greedy. “I can’t take the money.” “I don’t have change!” he said. “Keep the money with you. Consider it as an advance payment. Come tomorrow and read the paper for me. It will be a while before I start reading again.” Thanking him, I went looking for Rani to share the good news.  Lesson learnt : Honesty pays. (To be continued)  Pa touched my forehead. “You are  doing fine. Get out of the house. I am not going to let you hatch eggs at home.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/ch-ching/article32108667.ece
17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Money bags for Montu||The entire room was a picture of pandemonium. Utter chaos had taken over every nook and corner since vacations had started. Montu was not ready to move even an inch. He was least interested in doing the daily chores, which he used to finish in no time earlier. His books and clothes lay here and there in his room. On one such morning, mummy called out to Montu, “Can you please put this plate of rice in the balcony for the birds?” Mom was quite sure that Montu wouldn’t say “NO”, for he always enjoyed the sight of birds hopping around the balcony, chirping and nibbling on rice flakes. “I need some rest,” Montu replied in a weary tone. Mom was aghast but made her way towards the balcony to feed the birds. Dad, who was watching the entire episode, went into Montu’s room and tried to reason with him. “Montu, I hope you know that everybody in the house needs to contribute towards the daily chores. Your mom also needs some rest. She gets so tired after completing all the chores by herself and I am also not available during the day to help her out,” he said. “You are right, Dad, but my friend Amit told me that we need to do chores only if we get paid. His mom pays him whenever he helps her,” Montu replied. Dad was stunned but regained his composure and came up with an ace: “Is that all? I will also give you money bags but you will have to help out your mom without any fuss.” Montu hugged his Dad. “Oh, really? Thank you, Dad! I will not let you down.” Change in attitude Right away, Montu jumped out of his bed and started tidying his room. Within no time, all his books and clothes were neatly arranged in the cupboard. He searched for Mom and found her sitting on a mat on the terrace. She was applying a pain-relief ointment on her ankle, which seemed to be swollen. Montu took the ointment from her hand and started applying it on her ankle. Mom gently brushed his hair. Montu’s eyes welled up with tears and he buried his face in his mother’s sari. In the evening, when he spotted his Mom bending down to take out vegetables from the refrigerator, Montu ran to her and said, “Let me do it, Mom.” Gradually, Montu started enjoying helping his Mom with the household chores. While they worked together, Mom would narrate stories from her childhood, which Montu loved listening to. One evening, while Montu was enjoying a story session with his Mom, Dad walked in and said, “Montu, you have exceeded my expectations in helping Mom, so I am going to give you your money bags.” “No, Dad. I don’t deserve them. You and Mom work so hard, while I didn’t even bother to help. I am sorry...” Montu was remorseful. “Just look at your money bags,” said Dad, pointing to the wall. Montu glanced at the wall and all he could see was the calendar, with February’s dates, before him. He looked at his Dad, puzzled. Dad smiled and said, “This year, February has four Sundays, four Mondays, four Tuesdays, four Wednesdays, four Thursdays, four Fridays and four Saturdays. This happens only once every 823 years. This is called money bags.” Montu burst out laughing.  Montu, I hope you know that everybody in the house needs to contribute towards the daily chores.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/money-bags-for-montu/article32108697.ece

And that is where his story truly begins —one of hope, perseverance, and miracles. They escape to the U.S. where they live in a New York City homeless shelter, after being refused shelter by their own family, while they wait to be granted religious asylum. In the meanwhile, Tani’s father, who comes from a royal family and has left behind 13 employees in Nigeria, becomes a dishwasher and an Uber driver to support his family. Tani’s mother, whose family helps oversee the finances for a large Nigerian printing press and who worked at a bank for more than eight years, trains to become a home health aide. Tani and his older brother begin attending school, where his classmates are unaware that he and his family have no home. So when Tani asks his parents if he could join the chess programme at school, which requires a fee, it seems unlikely. But his mother writes to the coach, who offers Tani a scholarship. “Talent is universal. Opportunity is not,” says Tani in the book. So grabbing every bit of opportunity, Tani practices his game for hours and begins competing in the ultra-exclusive chess clubs of New York City. Less than a year after he learns to play, Tani wins the New York State chess championship! Despite having no TV, no games, no money; Tani’s delightful story of determination to change his destiny will serve to inspire readers of all ages. The book is narrated by both Tani and his parents, and is divided into five parts.

Powerfully built, this breed is believed to have originated in France as a guard dog, protecting herds of cattle from predators. These massive pups take up to 18 months to reach their full size and, because of their big size, they digest food faster. Their stomachs contain very high levels of acids that quickly break down meat and bone and help them process their food four times faster than humans. Another fact: these dogs drool a lot. Anyone who lives with a Bordeaux quickly becomes familiar with strings of drool covering furniture, floors, and walls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/cruise-with-the-canines/article32108677.ece

On one such morning, mummy called out to Montu, “Can you please put this plate of rice in the balcony for the birds?” Mom was quite sure that Montu wouldn’t say “NO”, for he always enjoyed the sight of birds hopping around the balcony, chirping and nibbling on rice flakes. “I need some rest,” Montu replied in a weary tone. Mom was aghast but made her way towards the balcony to feed the birds. Dad, who was watching the entire episode, went into Montu’s room and tried to reason with him. “Montu, I hope you know that everybody in the house needs to contribute towards the daily chores. Your mom also needs some rest. She gets so tired after completing all the chores by herself and I am also not available during the day to help her out,” he said. “You are right, Dad, but my friend Amit told me that we need to do chores only if we get paid. His mom pays him whenever he helps her,” Montu replied. Dad was stunned but regained his composure and came up with an ace: “Is that all? I will also give you money bags but you will have to help out your mom without any fuss.” Montu hugged his Dad. “Oh, really? Thank you, Dad! I will not let you down.” Change in attitude Right away, Montu jumped out of his bed and started tidying his room. Within no time, all his books and clothes were neatly arranged in the cupboard. He searched for Mom and found her sitting on a mat on the terrace. She was applying a pain-relief ointment on her ankle, which seemed to be swollen. Montu took the ointment from her hand and started applying it on her ankle. Mom gently brushed his hair. Montu’s eyes welled up with tears and he buried his face in his mother’s sari. In the evening, when he spotted his Mom bending down to take out vegetables from the refrigerator, Montu ran to her and said, “Let me do it, Mom.” Gradually, Montu started enjoying helping his Mom with the household chores. While they worked together, Mom would narrate stories from her childhood, which Montu loved listening to. One evening, while Montu was enjoying a story session with his Mom, Dad walked in and said, “Montu, you have exceeded my expectations in helping Mom, so I am going to give you your money bags.” “No, Dad. I don’t deserve them. You and Mom work so hard, while I didn’t even bother to help. I am sorry...” Montu was remorseful. “Just look at your money bags,” said Dad, pointing to the wall. Montu glanced at the wall and all he could see was the calendar, with February’s dates, before him. He looked at his Dad, puzzled. Dad smiled and said, “This year, February has four Sundays, four Mondays, four Tuesdays, four Wednesdays, four Thursdays, four Fridays and four Saturdays. This happens only once every 823 years. This is called money bags.” Montu burst out laughing.  Montu, I hope you know that everybody in the house needs to contribute towards the daily chores.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/money-bags-for-montu/article32108704.ece
17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||He left on a high note||The high-volume kombu heralds a fresh page or chapter in Kerala’s traditional mega orchestral concerts. Typically, such phrases from the wind instrument retreat on a sustained note. Chengamanad Appu Nair personified this aesthetic essence through the seven decades of his career; only his death was abrupt. The tall man held aloft the C-shaped horn and blew into it with practised ease. He led with panache a line-up mandated to add resonance to certain passages. The unhurried music, filtered through patterned beats, would announce an impending gain of momentum — often subtle, occasionally stark. Such extra-loud harbingers embellish panchavadyam and melam in the classical yet popular temple ensembles that span two to four hours. Much like the smooth curve of the metallic kombu, Nair arched gracefully above his colleagues. He inspired youngsters and won the trust of the anchor drummers of the timila or chenda who face the caparisoned elephants. Be it festivities at day or night, the kombu row guaranteed a wholesome treat when Nair stood in the middle. Until the last ‘pooram season,’ that is. The post-Onam revelry slackened this summer, following the Covid outbreak in mid-March. Then, this month, Nair, 85, died of cancer at a hospital near his residence off Angamaly in Ernakulam district. The curtains fell suddenly on a life steeped in disciplined routine and dedicated rigour. Adapting to changes Chenda maestro Peruvanam Kuttan Marar recalls Nair’s capability to adapt to changing times without compromising on the basics. “If the melam is panchari (of six beats and its multiples), the supporting kombu can afford to enter some 15 minutes after the start. But Nair would join us right from ‘go’ (at extremely slow pace) till the frenzied climax,” says the Padma awardee Merar. “Over the past 50 years, he succeeded in popularising the bassy baari variant of the kombu in place of the relatively shrill timiri.” Odakkali Murali, who is widely regarded as the flag bearer of the Nayathode school of kombu vitalised by Nair (1935-2020), explains his guru’s eclecticism. “Our style has elements from Machad,” says the disciple, referring to the heritage village near Wadakanchery, 20 km north of Kerala’s cultural capital of Thrissur. “My teacher explored the possibilities of improvisations. That expanded the frontiers of the kombu pattu.” The ‘pattu’ is a kombu-centric concert lasting around 45 minutes. Customarily preceding the melam, the main player blows phrases that are then replicated by artistes flanking him. As the ilathalam cymbals keep time, the three-piece kombu, with no holes, demands much lung power to conjure up formulations based on a range of long tala cycles. This conventional item found an altered presentation from the mid-1970s onwards. That was when the horizontal maddalam was introduced opposite the kombu men. Nair’s collaboration with top percussionist Kalamandalam Sankara Warrier won appreciation. “We retrieved a vintage system that was waning in north Malabar. Today, it is back in some places,” notes Warrier, hailing Nair, who went on to receive the government’s coveted Pallavur Puraskaram among others. The artiste’s father, Edayakudi Narayanan Nair, was his first guru. The initial lessons equipped Appu to apprentice at the Mahadeva temple in nearby Chengamanad beside the Periyar river. The teenager pursued higher studies under Vypeen Raman Nair, who used to guide Appu at festivals far and near. A break came at one such venue, where timila exponent Kuzhur Narayana Marar noticed his talent and chose Nair for row panchavadyam. “There was no looking back for him after that,” says frontline timila player Chottanikkara Subhash. “Some people are benign captains by nature. Appu Nair with the kombu was one such person.” Sprightliness apart, the master entertained no nonsense, points out Kodakara Ramesh, general secretary of the Kerala Kshethra Vadyakala Academy founded in 1990. “A patron of our organisation for the uplift of temple artistes, Nair was a founder-member. At meetings, he would deftly resolve issues, countering unreasonable criticisms with warmth,” he adds. Nair was no different in the family. His day would begin before dawn, followed by a visit to the local shrine, minimal food, evening walk and dusk-time prayers. “In 2015, he gave us special classes, which continued almost till his death on July 4,” says Rahul Kochery, 25, a grandson of Nair. “Grandpa was strict, though he never scolded us,” chips in Rahul’s brother Ranjith. The exercise began after panchavadyam enthusiast Kalady Krishna Iyer prompted Nair to ensure the household endured its legacy. Today, the two siblings are acknowledged artistes. His kombu, surfing on just the three octaves of sa-pa-sa, could croon umpteen ornamentations. “Nothing is small,” Nair used to say with a broad smile.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/he-left-on-a-high-note/article32107981.ece
17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Asha and yesterday once more||“I was walking around Durbar Square in Kathmandu, admiring the architecture of the temples, when I saw a man in a colourful shirt and quirky sunglasses standing in a café there. He looked familiar. I walked in and to my surprise found that it was Pancham (R.D. Burman). ‘Hello Ashaji, come listen to this,’ he said, excitedly. He was listening to a record with just different kinds of sounds. Back in Bombay, after a month, I got a call from him for a recording. It was a marvellous, peppy composition. While rendering it, I remembered the sounds I had heard at the Kathmandu café and reproduced some of them. Pancham was delighted with the song. But two days later, he informed me that the song had been deleted from the film. I was extremely upset and headed straight to director Dev Anand saab’s house. I told him it’s a wonderful number and should be retained at any cost. He thought for some time and said, since you are saying so I shall. But the problems didn’t seem to end. All India Radio banned the song. Fortunately, Radio Ceylon began to play it. ‘Dum Maro Dum’ became a super hit and was the Sartaj Geet on Binaca Geetmala.” Sharing happy moments Cut to the present. Asha Bhosle, the trailblazing playback singer who made every song her own with iconic flourishes, is now taking music lovers on a journey into her life and an era gone by. “With the lockdown halting our hectic pace of life and making us stay indoors, I have been on a nostalgia trip. I’ve often been talking to my son Anand about interesting moments in my career. One day he told me, ‘Wouldn’t it be lovely if you let the world know about these moments?’ And I thought, yes, this is the time, when we are in the grip of a pandemic, to share some nice thoughts with people,” says Asha. Thus, the mother-son duo launched the YouTube series ‘Asha Ki Asha’. The title track says it all, ‘Baatein purani yaad aati hai.’ “It was Anand’s idea to keep the episodes short because I can get carried away reminiscing about the past. The great musicians, singers, lyricists and actors I have worked with have enriched my music and soul. Over the last three weekends that we have been streaming this series, I realised that young aspirants in the field of music should know what it takes to gain expertise in an art and make a mark,” says the 86-year-old singer, who launched her YouTube channel this May. “Even at this age, I enjoy discovering new things. It could be a tune, a dish (her love for cooking led her to launch Asha’s, a chain of restaurants) or technology. I am often asked what I think of contemporary film music. And my constant answer is, accept change, whether or not you like it.” With over 20,000 songs in almost 18 languages, Asha, who has been the muse of composers O.P. Nayyar and R.D. Burman, has always challenged herself by exploring genres and collaborating with a range of musicians such as Ali Akbar Khan, Sultan Khan, Boy George, Michael Stipe of R.E.M., and the Kronos Quartet. Over the years, she has kept listeners guessing about what she would do next. They have marvelled at the way she moulds her voice to match the mood of the composition — the playfulness of pop, the melodic sophistication of classical, and the ache and sensuality of romantic geet and ghazal. “Recording studios were nothing but extended filmsets then. There would be 50 to 60 musicians in the live orchestra. Work would begin by 10 a.m. and go on sometimes till late evening. I would only have tea and biscuits through the day. If the singer coughed or missed a note, one had to start all over again. It was tough yet enjoyable. There was so much interaction among singers, musicians and composers that every recording was a learning experience,” recalls Asha, who has travelled across the globe performing stage shows to full-house audiences. Her appeal lies in her accessibility to all ages. If she comes across as an artiste with deep musical sensibilities, with the flip of a tune, she can transform into an entertainer with her spontaneous improvisation and joviality. Asha comes from a family of performers. Her father, Pt. Dinanath Mangeshkar, had a travelling music and drama company. As a child, Asha sang for the troupe. After his death, she eavesdropped on her elder sister Lata’s classical music class, before she herself underwent training in it. “I sang my first song in 1943 and then began a long struggle. I have faced rejection and failure and several personal crises. Despite singing difficult and different songs that were hits, there were times when I wasn't offered projects. With every setback, I emerged stronger. I learnt to believe more in myself and my dreams. Jaise sangeet mein kabhi neeche ke sur lagte hain, aur kabhi upar ke, zindagi bhi waisi hi hai . (Life is like music, there are both high notes and low),” says Asha.  When I am in the mood to listen to some music, I prefer light classical. I do not like to listen to my songs. Once a song is recorded and released, I never go back to it   When I am in the mood to listen to some music, I prefer light classical. I do not like to listen to my songs. Once a song is recorded and released, I never go back to it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/asha-and-yesterday-once-more/article32107958.ece
17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Mind your movement and muscle||More often than not, artistic education revolves only around the art form and not the lifestyle and habits appropriate to its practice. “Dancing comes with a lot of wear and tear. We constantly need to be conscious of training our body and mind,” said dancer Lasya Mavillapalli as she opened the conversation in a recent online workshop. And repertoires must be open to changes based on the time period of a piece and its intensity. For dancers the challenge is the preparation for this rigorous activity — practice, rehearsal and performance — which demand a routine that can supports the vigour. Lasya spoke to Dr. N.K. Aridhas, Shiny Surendran and Lara Abiesheikh about ‘Nutrition, Strength Training and Yoga Therapy for Dancers’ in a series of conversations that was titled Art Room.  Fitness components Former national athlete Dr. N.K. Aridhas is widely known for ‘Fit for Dance’, a paper he authored on strength and conditioning for dancers, for a UNESCO session in Greece. It won him critical appreciation. Having studied in detail about dancers and their repertoires, Aridhas lists the fitness components that are most important for dance: Speed, strength (static and dynamic), endurance (the ability to render a full performance without fatigue), flexibility (facilitating freer movement), coordination (of multiple elements of one’s body) and agility. “A warm-up session for a minimum of five minutes is a must, either before a performance or rehearsal. However, that said, your muscles will not respond sufficiently if you hold stretches or exercises for only five seconds. It needs at least 20-30 seconds (per stretch) to give you some benefit,” said Aridhas. With dancers, especially of classical forms, before rehearsals or even before the day of performance, the pieces need not be practised in full costume. This effects the prep and warm-up routine one needs before the show. How does one map the exercises to be done? Aridhas recommended sitting stretches before rehearsals to warm up the hamstrings, inner thighs and calf muscles. For pre-programme, standing stretches are more useful since one is already in costume. . In case of injuries (neck, upper and lower back and knees), the doctor suggested finding the root cause of pain before embarking on stretches and exercises. “Assess the needs of your body and and pain levels, so as to tailor exercises and stretches as required,” he cautioned as he demonstrated a few basic exercises to attempt for specific injuries. As for exercise equipment, Aridhas recommended dumbbells and weights. Core strengthening can be done with variations in planks. When asked why one should devote time to an exercise routine when dance itself is a form of exercise, he said, “Quite simply to diversify the routine, prevent injury and improve your performance. All of these can be dealt with better when your routine reaches an assorted balance.” Nutrition guide Shiny Surendran, a specialist in sports nutrition and preventive nutrition, guided participants through a planned diet for dance. “There should be a gap of at least three hours after a solid meal. Especially on the performance day, eat something that you are used to , don’t try anything new,” she said. She also recommended liquid meal replacements 20-30 minutes before the performance for those who feel hungry often. A dance performance may be followed by a large meal in celebration, said Shiny with a smile, but recommended a smaller portion right after the performance to recover the energy spent. “Maybe some cornflakes, muesli or peanut butter sandwiches, and bananas should do. Then go home and have a good dinner.” Each person’s body requires specific nutrition and exercise patterns, especially if you are looking to lose weight. “If you’re cutting down on calories, increase your protein intake. It will subdue the constant craving and tiredness one feels,” she said. Shiny also suggested maintaining a food diary to keep a check on intake, “Observing how your body reacts to what you eat is also a way to check for allergies. If you’re feeling foggy and tired all the time, a significant drop in attention span and feeling dull, bloating — all these could be signs that your diet and lifestyle habits need a shift.” How does one avoid muscular cramps? “Hydration is important, but please stretch, it’s related to your neuro-muscular circuit. As far as your food goes, please get food rich in calcium, magnesium and zinc,” Shiny explained. Addressing meal planning, she said, “Fill half the plate with vegetables, the other half with one quarter grains and the other quarter with protein. After dance, when you’re hungry, it’s best to have soya milk, protein milkshakes or a banana. If there’s an inherent tendency to overeat after the performance, consuming these will help. Stay hydrated! We tend to perceive thirst as hunger.” Considering dancers’ erratic schedules, Shiny reiterated the importance of timing. “Have breakfast, typically within two hours of waking up, and lunch somewhere between 11a.m. and 1p.m. Try to avoid caffeine after 4 p.m. and have dinner by 8.p.m.” Breathing pattern Lara Abisheikh’s session was an insight into the importance and use of yoga in harmony with breath control. “Breathing is a core component — the patterns of inhalation and exhalation are distinctly different within dancers, therefore we need to find a system of balance and checks to compensate for the exertion that comes from dance.” Lara, a pioneer in yoga therapy, explained, “An asana has multiple functions and benefits in how it’s performed. We need to keep in mind the dancer’s specific needs and modify it to suit the same.” He demonstrated exercises that are useful for anybody after a gruelling and tiring performance. He also gave an overview of how our breathing system functions in a surya-chandran cycle over the hours of the day. “Some individuals have a better inhale over their exhale and possibly vice versa, in that case we observe the breathing pattern and correct it. Leaving this imbalance without correction, leaves you prone to conditions and diseases,” said Lara, giving an insight into how breath control plays a crucial role in a dancer’s life, especially during the performance years. The Founder of Vinieyoga Healing Centre (Chennai), Lara demonstrated how Surya Namaskar can be moulded outside its usually popular framework. “The same sequence can be seen in three different ways — to stretch, to energise practice with breath control, and incorporated with chanting sounds changed into a relaxing practice. Just the Surya Namaskar can be utilised across 24 tool variations — inhale, exhale, holding the inhale, holding the exhale and sounds are just the basics. Tools to intensify this practice needs to be tailored to individual needs.” A dancer’s body requires 80 per cent flexibility and 20 per cent strengthening and balancing. “Most often people end up trying to increase strengthening and topple this ratio, which can cause tightening of muscles and lead to sharp pain,” said Lara about the common practice of adopting new exercise routines without proper understanding of one’s needs. Such conversations become vital as dancers today try to find newer ways to connect with and excel in their art. In the process, they have to prepare their body for fresh challenges and experiments. And staying fit has been one of the primary concerns for performers during this extended lockdown.

17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||The name changers||Sometimes death makes us revisit what seems like closed chapters. The demise of Jagdeep last week made one wonder what if the actor tweaked the iconic dialogue from Sholay that immortalised and pigeonholed him, and asked the world, ‘ Mera Naam Jagdeep Aise Hi Nai Hai ’. Why is it that Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed Jaffrey had to adopt a Hindu name for the screen? Of course, he was not alone, the list is long, starting right from the thespian Dilip Kumar. For a generation born during the era of the three Khans, they might just seem like interesting curios for a quiz session but if you dig deep, it reflects a social divide that didn’t spare even the creative spaces, after Partition. In hindsight, we could say the directors who renamed them or the actors who rechristened themselves faulted on the side of caution by doubting the secular credentials of the Indian audience, but you never know. But why was it that Badaruddin Jamaluddin Kazi had to be renamed Johnny Walker. Didn’t it typecast him as a comedian, who would perform a drunkard with consummate ease, for life? Interestingly, if heroes were renamed, they were given a generic surname like Kumudial Ganguly became Ashok Kumar, Harikrishna Goswami became Manoj Kumar or in some cases, the surname was dropped altogether like in the case of Jeetendra (Ravi Kapoor) and Dharmendra (Dharam Singh Deol). It was done, perhaps, to rise above the caste or regional barriers. Some simply wanted to correct the mistakes of their parents. How the youth would have connected to Dev Anand if he were called Dharamdev Pishorimal Anand? As Harihar Jethalal Jariwala, Sanjeev Kumar would have lost some of his versatility! Comedians hardly ever got the luxury of flaunting a surname. From Gope (Gope Vishasdas Kamlani) and Agha (Aghajan Baig) to Mehmood (Mehmood Ali), the audience always knew comic actors on a first-name basis. Same for the heroines. From Nargis and Madhubala to Nutan and Nanda, they hardly had the luxury to carry their true or complete identity in film credits. However, there was one actress who didn’t compromise on her name. One of the conditions that Waheeda Rehman put before Guru Dutt before signing CID was that she would not change her name for something that sounded sensuous. That insiders were allowed to retain the family surname even in the 1950s and 1960s reflect that nepotism existed in some form even in the Golden Era. The Kapoor clan is an easy example to cite but the fact that Joy Mukherjee could carry his surname, something his uncle Ashok Kumar could not, tells us the power of influence. Love for Urdu Coming back to Jagdeep, the actor got his first dialogue because he knew Urdu. Picked up from a street in Bombay to be part of a crowd of children in B.R. Chopra’s Afsar , Jagdeep was promised three rupees. When the child actor on stage could not deliver his lines in Urdu, assistant director Yash Chopra started looking for an alternative. Jagdeep famously asked the child sitting next to him, how much would he get if he could justify the lines. “Six rupees,” pat came the answer. Rest, as they say, is history. Those were the days when Urdu didn’t belong to a religion. In fact, Hindi cinema played an important role in keeping Urdu ticking in the heart of India without any credit in the Censor certificate. Recently, one came across a Facebook post that said how would Amitabh Bachchan’s famous dialogue, ‘Don Ko Pakadna Mushkil Hi Nahin, Namumkin hai’ would have sounded in Hindi: ‘Don Ko Pakadna Kathin Hi Nahin, Asambhav Hai’. As Javed Akhtar often says as long as we understand it, we think it is Hindi but the moment a difficult/Persian origin word comes, we shout, it is Urdu! But one doesn’t completely agree with him for one belongs to a generation which left no leaf unturned to understand the meaning of Gulzar’s ‘zihal-e-miskeen mukon-ba ranjish, bahaal-e-hijra bechara dil hai’ ( Ghulami, 1985 ), set to the music by Laxmikant Pyarelal. Go figure!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-name-changers/article32107962.ece
17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Jyotsna Bhatt: the high priestess of fire and clay||When Thomas Gray penned “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard”, he used the lines:  “Full many a gem of purest ray serene,   The dark unfathom’d caves of ocean bear …”  These words exemplify the life and work of ceramic artist and mentor Jyotsna Bhatt, who passed away in Vadodara on Saturday. In her more than 50-year career, Bhatt upgraded, refined and ennobled her art and created an original repertoire. Simplicity and vividness were the best attributes to describe her art and ceramics. Simplicity, for her, meant silent sophistication. Nature was her leitmotif. She framed forms through her own understanding of nature and human experience. She glazed her ceramics in such an inimitable way, giving them evocative rugged and rough surfaces. Jyotsnaben  , as she was popularly called, considered Ira Chaudhri as the Guru of the Indian ceramic movement. Her  intrinsic understanding of the relationship between form and the ferment became her signature. Her sculpted entities around nature, the spontaneity of clay and the marvels of expression speaking through her plant forms, owls and smiling cats. Born Jyotsna Shroff in 1940 at Mandvi in Kutch, she lost her father early but her uncle saw her aptitude in fine arts and encouraged her to pursue it. Her journey at the wheel began in the 1960s in Vadodara. A high priestess of the world of minerals and fire and clay, she looked around her garden at Vadodara for stimulus and inspiration. Her sensitivity and her distinct sensibility was born of a deep understanding of the arts and crafts heritage of Gujarat. Her journey saw the genesis of a silent yet robust modernist potter, who was at home in the contemporary world and comfortable in her own skin, sharing secrets as she went along. Jyotsnaben  had been a part of several group exhibitions, workshops, art camps, and solo shows. Her last shows at Kolkata and Vadodara showcased a deluge of delightful creations. In her agile hands, inert matter like stoneware, signature matte glazes and minerals seem to awaken, smoke, stretch and settle into a position of poise and reflective reverie. In Delhi, most of her shows were held at Art Heritage, Triveni. She was also particular about her prices; didn’t want to get into the elitist markets and kept her prices reasonable. Stoneware was her preferred medium. More than just a ceramic artist, she was a mentor, a pedagogue exemplifying humility, grace and wisdom.  India has lost a fine practitioner and doyenne in the world of ceramic art practices.  (The writer is a   senior art critic)   Simplicity and vividness were the best attributes to describe her art and ceramics. Simplicity, for her, meant silent sophistication.

17 July 2020||July 17 2020 00:00 IST,||A family’s bond with the bani||It was Trichur. The legendary M.L.Vasanthakumari was in concert. A huge crowd had gathered to hear her. Sitting among them was a 10-year-old boy. Suddenly the lights went off, engulfing the pandal in darkness. Undeterred, MLV sang, ‘Radha samedha Krishna,’ and the lights came back to a huge applause. The little boy enjoyed the whole experience, hardly realising that he would one day become a well-known Carnatic vocalist and a disciple of the inimitable G.N. Balasubramaniam. That boy is Trichur Ramachandran. Such wonderful memories surfaced in an online event organised recently to mark M L Vasanthakumari’s 92nd birth anniversary. It featured veteran musicians Trichur and Charumathi Ramachandran and their vocalist-daughter Subhashree. They were in conversation with Rohit Dhamankar, co-founder of Austin-based organisation, Antarnaada. Infectious energy Besides interesting anecdotes, Charumathi, one of MLV’s prime disciples, rendered her guru’s favourite compositions such as ‘Sri Viswanatham Bhajeham.’ MLV’s infectious creative energy and her sense of humour also came up during the conversation. Trichur Ramachandran, who opted music over a career in medicine, came under GNB's tutelage. After GNB passed away, he approached MLV and remained her student till her last years. “MLV’s bani was unique. Her wonderful extempore Revathi raga RTP at a concert still lingers in mind,” says Trichur Ramachandran. “A dynamic musician, her raga explorations were like lessons in understanding the nuances of Carnatic music. She could perform difficult pancha-nadai pallavis, and collaborated with greats like Mudicondan Venkatarama Iyer and Alathur Brothers. Charumathi recalled how she, at age 12, met her guru. “I was accompanied by my mother Alamelu Viswanathan. My mother requested MLV to accept me as her disciple." Two years later, Charumathi accompanied MLV on stage. Talking about singing kalpanaswaras at concerts with MLV, Charumathi said it was a challenge as it was mostly extempore. “She would often say, ‘Observe me closely and you will imbibe the style.’ She used to make me take turns in niraval for ‘Badari vanamula’ in the kriti ‘Akshayalinga Vibho’ (Sankarabharanam), and that interaction became popular.”Thus, she saw up-close the genesis of MLV’s manodharma. Charumathi sang snatches of Mohanam to explain spuritam (repeating notes in twos), and ravajati brigas (intricate speed phrases). She then rendered phrases of Abheri in true MLV style and said, “Her bhavam on the gandharam was incredible.” MLV’s mastery over tanam singing was unparalleled. Demonstrating a few beautiful phrases from MLV’s favourite Hindustani ragas such as Behag and Tilang, Charumathi also demonstrated how unforgettable was MLV’s unexpected manodharma in kalpanaswara for pieces like ‘Mokshamu Galada’ (Saramati). She also exhibited the MLV touch in rare ragas like Varamu. Joining in the conversation, Subhashree Ramachandran recalled her memorable interactions with MLV at concerts and at home, “In her bani, you have everything. She rendered ‘Kalyana Gopalam’ (Sindhu Bhairavi) to show how her music is soaked in the beauty of the bani.  MLV was not only an exemplary performer, she was always enthusiastic to share rare nuances of music with her disciples||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/a-familys-bond-with-the-bani/article32107976.ece

Venkatrama Ghanapatigal, the founder trustee of Sri Sankara Gurukula Veda Patashala, launched in 1984 at Veda Bhavan, Hyderabad, passed away last Friday in the city. He was 74. Belonging to Tirunelveli district, Sri Venkatrama Ghanapatigal was born in 1946 in Madras. He underwent gurukula vasam at the Patashalas in Tiruvidaimarudur and Kanchipuram. On successful completion of his studies (Yajur Veda), he was awarded the title ‘Ghanapati’. ‘Sri Ghanapatigal,’ as he was fondly referred to, also went on to complete the study of the Yajur Veda Bhashyam. He was awarded the title ‘Salakshana Ghanapati’ and ‘Veda Bhashya Ratna’ by the Kanchi Kamakoti Pitam and Sringeri Sharadambal Pitam. He was the recipient of the President’s Award. An upholder of Sanatana Dharma, a pioneer in ‘Veda Rakshana,’ a disciple of the Kanchi and Sringeri Mutts, Sri Venkatrama Ghanapatigal spearheaded the revival of Vedic tradition and education for more than five decades. He served the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) in various capacities, and was an EC member till his death. Hundreds of Veda Vidyarthis graduate every year from the Sankara Gurukula Veda Patasala after mastering their respective shakhas (branches) of the Rig, Yajur or Sama Vedas. Many students from other patasalas also used to come for training under his astute scholarship and several young scholars had completed their studies up to the “ghana” stage under Ghanapatigal’s tutelage. Sri Ghanapatigal was the epitome of benevolence, deeply invested in the spiritual growth of his students and community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/remembering-a-vedic-scholar/article32107986.ece

Subbaraj Urs, the president of The Academy of Music (that runs the Chowdiah Memorial Hall) is Chowdiah’s seven-stringed violin, part of its collection housed in the hall dedicated to Chowdiah. “Chowdiah’s family came personally to hand over the heritage instrument, as they felt it was worth sharing it with the public,” says Subbaraj. He is also delighted that this special birth anniversary of the violinist coincides with the 40th anniversary of Chowdiah Memorial Hall. It was businessman and politician K.K. Murthy who took upon himself the mantle of creating a memorial for the violinist along with music connoisseur K. Srikantiah. The building came up in 1980, helped by a Rs. 20 lakh government grant besides bank loans and public contributions. Says Prasanna Kumar K, secretary of The Academy of Music, “My father Murthy had a bank balance of Rs. 500 then. People laughed at his dream of making a 1000+ seat hall on the 60,000 sq. ft site. But he wanted it to be one of its kind and shaped like a violin. Even the strings have been designed impeccably by architect S.N. Murthy. Today Chowdiah Memorial Hall and the Awards instituted in the names of Murthy and Chowdiah are taking forward the legacy of music.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/bow-to-history/article32107965.ece

17 July 2020||NEW DELHI,||DMC committee report presented to L-G, CM||Delhi Minorities Commission’s fact-finding committee — constituted to look into the February riots in north-east Delhi — released its report on Thursday and presented its findings with a request for further action to the Lieutenant-Governor, Chief Minister, Speaker of the Assembly and all other Ministers in the Delhi government. The report recommended that the government should constitute an independent five-member committee chaired by a retired High Court Judge with a multi-fold mandate. It said the mandate must ensure proper and prompt registration of cases where complaints have not yet been converted into FIRs, ensure the recording of victims’ statements under Section 164 of CrPC, ensure witness and victim protection in accordance with the Delhi Witness Protection Scheme, review chargesheets filed by the police in light of left-out facts and probe the complicity and abdication of duty by Delhi Police in allowing the violence to take place.  It added that the committee should ensure that compensation is paid to all victims in a fair and time-bound manner and review the Delhi government’s assistance scheme for the riot victims. The report suggested that there is a serious disparity in the determination of compensation amounts in cases of deaths of public servants and ordinary citizens who lost their lives in the violence due to failure of authorities. “Even after four months of the violence, the verification process has not been completed in many cases. In lot of cases, after verification, no compensation or a very small amount of ‘interim compensation’ has been paid,” the report stated. Legal service to victims Other recommendations include establishing a team of 5-10 experienced trial court advocates, competent in the practice of the criminal law, in collaboration with the Delhi State Legal Services Authority, to render legal services to the victims; ensuring a gender balance in the team, and making sure that special measures are taken to assist women and child victims, including filing complaints of sexual violence against private persons and/or public officials. It also recommended seeking a legal opinion from a retired Supreme Court or High Court judge to assist the High Court in its determination on the direct and proximate nexus of the speeches and slogans raised by political leaders that led to the break-out of violence in the north-east district. Special measures It added that special measures must be taken to ensure that no person who has exhibited bias against any group is appointed as Public Prosecutor in these cases and that measures should be taken to ensure that Public Prosecutors act in a fair and impartial manner and in the interest of justice.  Even after four months of the violence, the verification process has not been completed in many cases. In many cases, after verification, no compensation or a very small amount of “interim compensation” has been paid DMC Report||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/dmc-committee-report-presented-to-l-g-cm/article32108283.ece
17 July 2020||GUWAHATI,||Five more die in Assam floods, toll reaches 71||Five more people lost their lives as the water level in the flood-affected districts of Assam remained more or less unchanged during the last 24 hours. With Thursday’s drowning of the five across four districts, the death toll in the two waves of floods since May 22 has reached 71. Landslides across the State during this period claimed 26 more lives. Landslides and floods have also killed at least 12 people in Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya. Officials of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said large swathes of the State did not experience rainfall but water from the hills in adjoining States saw the number of flood-affected districts rise to 27. “From 35.74 lakh, the number of affected people has increased to 39.8 lakh. The number of people who took shelter in relief camps also increased from 36,320 to 49,313 overnight,” an ASDMA spokesperson said. The flood-displaced people have taken refuge in 303 relief camps across 19 districts. The area of affected farmlands has also increased to 1.31 lakh hectares. Western Assam’s Dhubri district was the worst-affected for the second consecutive day with 8.72 lakh people living in makeshift camps of their own arrangement. Barpeta had 4.78 lakh affected people at the last count, followed by Goalpara (4.28 lakh), Morigaon (4.25 lakh) and Lakhimpur (3 lakh). Meanwhile, Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Thursday took a speedboat trip in the submerged areas of Kaziranga National Park (KNP) and took stock of condition of the marooned animals and measures taken by the park authorities to ensure their protection. He also went to the submerged anti-poaching forest camps and interacted with the forest guards. “Their surveillance of the park, braving all odds, to ensure the protection of the marooned animals has to be appreciated,” he said.  ‘90% of park flooded’ Officials said the water level in the 1,055 sq km KNP remained stagnant after falling a day ago. “About 90% of the park remains submerged with 99 of the 223 anti-poaching camps inundated,” the park’s director P. Sivakumar said. However, two one-horned rhinos drowned during the last 24 hours. The carcasses of three were found earlier, taking the rhino death count in the park to five. Another rhino died in Pobitora Sanctuary near Guwahati.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/five-more-die-in-assam-floods-toll-reaches-71/article32108312.ece
17 July 2020||New Delhi,||Sero survey result to take at least a week more, NCDC informs HC||The National Centre of Disease Control (NCDC) told the Delhi High Court on Thursday that the preliminary result of the sero surveillance sample testing across the Capital will take at least another one week to be ready. A Bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad asked NCDC’s Director Sujeet Kumar Singh, who was present during the videoconferencing hearing, to submit a copy of the result before the next hearing on July 27. The NCDC said the antibodies detection test was done to assess the prevalence of infection at the community level and primarily used for evidence-based public health response. It said the collected blood samples are additionally “collated based on epidemiological data and are then analysed for their stratification across different parameters which requires time and expertise”. It said that the sero surveillance analysis by NCDC is still under way and the preliminary report is likely to take at least one more week to be declared. The sero surveillance was carried out between June 27 and July 5, during which 21,387 blood samples were collected and tested for the presence of antibodies to assess prevalence of COVID-19 infections at community level. Accreditation, approval During the hearing, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said it has been granting approval to private labs and hospitals to conduct the rapid antigen detection test (RADT) and RT-PCR (real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) tests. In all, a total of 34 laboratories have been approved by the ICMR in Delhi for conducting the RADT and 26 applications are still pending on account of procedural formalities. ICMR said it has given one month time to the private labs and hospitals to apply for approval after getting accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories. “How is ICMR trying to promote ramping up of testing by giving such long windows to hospitals or laboratories to apply for accreditation?” the Bench remarked as it asked the ICMR to hasten the process of granting accreditation. “Considering that as on July 15 there are a total of 1,16,993 cases of COVID-19 infection in Delhi, out of which 17,807 are active cases and there are 653 containment zones, in our opinion the window of one month given by the ICMR for the applicants to complete the procedural formalities is too long,” the High Court said.  Not public friendly “The public is keen on getting themselves tested... how does it help if somebody has done RADT and has to undergo RT-PCR also? The person will have to go to another hospital to conduct the RT-PCR test,” the Bench remarked. “Surely, it is not helping the public as they have to run from pillar to post. The ultimate stakeholder is the public... you [the ICMR] have to tighten your range and give them [hospitals and labs] shorter time,” the court said. The High Court’s direction came while hearing a petition filed in public interest by one Rakesh Malhotra, highlighting various issues faced by individuals while undertaking tests for COVID-19. It will hear the case again on July 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sero-survey-result-to-take-at-least-a-week-more-ncdc-informs-hc/article32108301.ece
17 July 2020||GURUGRAM,||From drivers to vegetable vendors, it’s an auto switch||Driving down Major Sushil Aima Marg through Sector 22A towards Rezang La Chowk, it is hard to miss the autorickshaws dotting the road on the left in twos and threes. In fact, there is something unusual about these vehicles that makes their presence felt predominantly. Used for ferrying passengers before COVID-19 days, these autorickshaws have now been converted into makeshift mobile vegetable carts by removing their roofs. A little enquiry from these drivers-turned-vegetable vendors reveals that this trend has gained momentum in the Millennium City over the past fortnight or so. With metro rail and trains remaining suspended and schools and offices being shut, autorickshaw drivers, mostly migrants from Uttar Pradesh, have been rendered jobless and forced to sell vegetables to make both ends meet. Rent, EMIs and more Having left Gurugram for his home in Badaun, U.P., during the lockdown in a private vehicle, Siraj Hussain returned to the city a fortnight ago to start work again, but soon realised that not much had changed, at least for the autorickshaw drivers, despite the ‘unlock’ phase. “I was working with cab aggregators and made a decent Rs. 15,000-Rs. 20,000 per month. But on return, I could hardly earn Rs. 50-Rs. 100 despite the entire day’s hard work,” says Hussain. He then decided to convert his autorickshaw into a mobile cart and sell mangoes. And he is not alone. Abdul, also from Badaun, who is selling mangoes on his auto-turned-cart next to Siraj’s, has a similar story. He has not paid the instalments for his autorickshaw loan and his room rent since the lockdown. “Earlier, the financier and the landlord did not press for the money, but now they call often asking for the payment with interest. However, there is no work left and the situation is unlikely to improve anytime soon. The newspapers say that curfew could be imposed again in Gurugram,” says Abdul, sounding hopeless. Most of these drivers-turned-vendors make Rs. 200-Rs. 300 per day, which is not enough for them to even sustain themselves, let alone pay back the outstanding rent and the instalments. Shakir Raza, another auto driver now selling fruits, joins in saying that most of them didn’t have land holdings back home to earn their livelihood and were forced to come back to the city to make a living.   ‘No govt. help’ Raza claims that he, like others, did not receive “even a single rupee” help from the government and the ration supplied at the fair price shops back home was sipho-ned off by the middlemen. “We got ration only once in two months and that too only wheat and rice. We never got sugar, oil and other essentials,” says Nazib. They all stay on rent, sharing rooms, in the nearby Sat Guru Enclave and Om Vihar. Nazib says that earlier he ate at dhabas, but now he cooks on his own to save a few extra bucks. Kafiluddin, selling fruits in his auto near Ansal University roundabout on Golf Course Road, says he decided to convert his vehicle into a makeshift cart since buying a vegetable cart would mean an extra burden of Rs. 6,000-Rs. 7,000. “I removed the upper sheet and cut the iron grills to convert it into a cart for Rs. 1,500. It might cost me another Rs. 2,000 to restore it in its previous form,” says Kafiluddin. His relative Masroor Khan sells lemons next to him. ‘Only way out’ Though the transition from a driver to a vegetable vendor has not been smooth for many, it is not the case with Santosh Tripathi. Mostly stationed outside Rail Vihar in Sector 15 Part-II, Santosh had been selling vegetables for almost two decades before he bought an autorickshaw, four years ago, on loan. “When the COVID-19 pandemic hit my work, I decided to go back to my old job of selling vegetables. Many people in the group housing societies in this area know me and are regular customers. I also supply to their homes if they call me,” says Santosh, 45. “It’s difficult to say how long will we be able to survive like this, but for the time being this seems to be only way out. At least, we are earning enough to not to sleep on an empty stomach,” Siraj says, summing up the conversation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/from-drivers-to-vegetable-vendors-its-an-auto-switch/article32108304.ece
17 July 2020||New Delhi,||Delhi’s virus tally reaches 1,18,645 with 1,652 new cases||As many as 1,652 new COVID-19 cases were reported in Delhi in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 1,18,645, stated a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Thursday. Also, 58 more deaths have been reported, taking the total number of deaths to 3,545. Of the total cases, 97,693 people have recovered and there are 17,407 active cases currently. Since June 23, when the new cases almost touched 4,000 – the highest so far – the number of new cases has been dropping and it has been less than 3,000 for the past 20 days. The number of cases is less compared to the spike witnessed in June. But of the total 20,158 tests done in the past 24 hours, over 71.08% were rapid antigen tests, which have shown a low positivity rate compared to RT-PCR tests. The positivity rate, which is the percentage of people who test positive, has dropped from 12.2% on July 1 to 8.1% on Thursday. The active cases have been decreasing since July 1. The number of active cases was 27,007 on July 1 and saw a dip of 35.5% to reach 17,407 on Thursday. Also, the number of people admitted to COVID-19 hospitals has been steadily decreasing for the past 14 days. On July 1, a total of 5,892 beds in COVID-19 hospitals were occupied and it has decreased steadily to reach 3,819 on Thursday. The number of COVID-19 positive people in home isolation has also seen a dip from 16,703 on July 1 to 9,652. The number of containment zones in the Capital is 658. Meanwhile, the Delhi government has decided to operationalise 200 beds at under-construction Ambedkar Hospital. “All procurement/sourcing of logistics, supplies, structure and manpower for management of COVID-19 shall be done on nomination basis u/s 50 of Disaster Management Act. 2005,” an official order said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/capitals-virus-tally-reaches-118645-with-1652-new-cases/article32108310.ece
17 July 2020||New Delhi,||‘Multiple testimonies recount police inaction’||The report of the 10-member fact-finding committee of Delhi Minorities Commission headed by M.R. Shamshad says multiple testimonies collected by it recount reports of police inaction even as violence unfolded before them or of police not arriving despite repeated calls on the emergency call number. On the police investigation, the report says that multiple testimonies of victims of violence have reported that FIRs have either been delayed or not been acted upon. It added that in some cases, police refused to register an FIR unless the complainant omitted the names of the accused. According to the report, both the committee and the DMC sought information about FIRs and arrests etc. from Delhi Police but neither of them got any response. The report says that the committee would have been in a much better position to analyse the facts by looking into documents that it had requested for — such as the list of detainees since February 23, police station-wise copies of FIRs, complaints not converted into FIRs and copies of chargesheets — but those were not provided to them by the police despite several attempts. Mr. Shamshad in his foreword writes that partisanship and bias on the part of the police and government and a shoddy methodology adopted in the investigation process has led to the abject failure of duty and of the law and order machinery of the Capital. ‘Probe misdirected’ “Investigations have purposefully been misdirected to change the narrative of the cause of violence that erupted in the North East district. Instances of incitement of violence by politicians of national standing have been completely bypassed,” he says. Anil Mittal, Additional PRO of Delhi police, said they have not received the report officially and got to know of it through the media. He said the police have encouraged riot victims to come forward and report incidents in large numbers. “Each and every report was registered and investigated. We had given advertisements in newspapers and launched helpline numbers for riot victims to come forward and register complaints. All these efforts led to the registration of 752 FIRs in Delhi riots cases, the highest in any riots in the country,” said Mr. Mittal. The Additional PRO said Special Investigation Teams were formed for fair and detailed investigation and all the cases probed professionally. “Police have filed more than 200 chargesheets in the riots cases. Investigation has proceeded apace in 372 cases and 1,450 accused in all have been arrested so far,” he said. “For speedy trial in cases, Delhi Police requested special courts and a special prosecutor. A claims commissioner was also appointed to estimate the damage caused during the riots,” said Mr. Mittal. The DMC report also seeks to put the violence into the context of the Delhi Assembly election campaign from December 2019 to February 2020 in which a number of speeches by BJP leaders were allegedly made inciting people to violence against anti-CAA protesters. Mr. Shamshad in his foreword writes, “The protests (anti-CAA) were legitimate and peaceful. Seemingly to crush the protests, with the support of the administration and police, a retaliatory plan of pro-CAA protests was worked out to trigger violence at a large scale which led to loss of lives and damage to hundreds of properties owned mainly by the Muslim religious minority.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/multiple-testimonies-recount-police-inaction/article32108279.ece
17 July 2020||New Delhi,||Two arrested for murder at criminal’s parole release party||Two men were arrested on Thursday for allegedly killing two persons over personal enmity at a party organised for a criminal, who was recently released on parole, in South Delhi the police said. At 8.56 p.m. on Wednesday, Mehrauli police received information regarding a person with a bullet injury on his leg lying near Freedom Fighter Colony, they said. The victim was rushed to AIIMS hospital where he was declared brought dead. Cell phone found Police reached the spot and found a lot of blood on a slab near the jungle. They recovered a cell phone from there. Later, the police went inside the jungle and found blood, empty bottles of liquor, water and cigarette packets. On scanning the CCTV footage, it was found that six people, including the deceased, had come there in a white car. After parking the car near a vacant plot, they had proceeded to the jungle, a senior police officer said. On Thursday, the deceased was identified as Abdul Ali, a resident of Geeta Colony. “During investigation, the police traced the car and one of the suspects Vipin Balyan, a resident of Bhajanpura, was apprehended. On his instance, one Satender, a resident of Khajuri Khas, was also apprehended,” DCP (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said. The police inspected the jungle area again and with the help of a drone, one more body with gunshot injuries was recovered, the DCP said. Later, the deceased was identified as Sanjay, a resident of Geeta Colony. The deceased and the accused were part of a group of six people, who were identified earlier in the CCTV footage, the police said. Both the deceased were co-accused in an attempt to murder case registered at Geeta Colony police station, the police said. Investigations revealed that the accused were suspecting the deceased of passing information about them to the police. Efforts are being made to arrest the other two accused. One of them was identified as Banni, who had recently come out on parole, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/two-arrested-for-murder-at-criminals-parole-release-party/article32108287.ece
17 July 2020||Ghaziabad,||AMU student booked||The Aligarh police have registered an FIR against an Aligarh Muslim University student for making objectionable statements against a fellow student on social media. In her complaint addressed to the Senior Superintendent of Police, the female student of engineering had accused the student of architecture of threatening to put her behind a “brass hijab” when the university opened after the lockdown in a social media post. In her complaint, the girl claimed she was being harassed because of her pro-CAA and NRC stand in the past. A hosteller, she said had two more years to go and feared for her safety. Demanding strict action against the accused, she shared the screenshots of the abusive posts with the official and said the present posts came when she wrote about girls being forced to cover their heads in certain educational institutions on social media. Muniraj P, SSP Aligarh, said on the basis of the complaint an FIR has been registered against Rahbar Danish under Sections 504 and 506 of IPC and Section 67 of the IT Act. “After a preliminary inquiry, Section 153 A (promoting enmity on grounds of religion) of IPC has been added,” he said. As the accused is a resident of Aurangabad in Bihar, and is home because of the lockdown, the police officer said, policemen were being sent to Bihar to arrest the accused.  Varsity probe panel Shafey Kidwai, AMU spokesperson said, the university had constituted a three-member inquiry committee to look into the charges. Earlier, Meena Kumari, member of the Uttar Pradesh Women’s Commission, had asked the SSP to register an FIR against the accused. Condemning the incident, Faizul Hasan, former president of AMU Students’ Union, said: “There is zero tolerance for such an act on the campus.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/amu-student-booked/article32108313.ece

The petition also asked for direction to the government to continue operating the kiosks and helpdesk facilities for the benefit of those who are not covered under the regular PDS scheme. ‘One-time package’ Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, appearing for the Delhi government, said that the scheme was a “one-time” special relief package when there was a cessation of economic activities that ended after the lockdown was lifted. Mr. Jain said that the Delhi government had allocated certain amount of ration under the scheme that was in their resources. He said that the government is still distributing the left over ration to those in need. The High Court was hearing a petition by Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan (DRRAA) seeking to ensure effective and time-bound redress to complaints of non-supply of rations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the MMCSY, the Delhi government had in April set up the e-coupon system for giving rations to 10 lakh people that was subsequently revised to 30 lakh people who are not covered under the PDS, the plea said. The DRRAA stated that the Delhi government has discontinued the scheme of distribution of foodgrain to non-ration card holders (non-PDS) despite the national disaster declaration still being in force and despite no measure of normalcy having returned in the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-asks-govt-to-reply-to-plea-on-free-ration/article32108302.ece

Ms. Kalita’s counsel argued that the selective leaking of information relating to her case by the police was causing grave prejudice to her. She is currently facing four different FIRs connected with the anti-CAA protests in Jaffrabad, north-east Delhi riots and violence in Daryaganj. In her plea, Ms. Kalita has sought direction to Delhi Police to not leak any information pertaining to her to the media pending investigation.
