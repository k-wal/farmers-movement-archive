Being a member of the Communist Party, Bhattacharjee had his role clearly defined and was under no compulsion to splash his photographs on hoardings and banners beyond the borders of Bengal. Mamata Banerjee, on the other hand, is compelled to be seen outside Bengal since the chief minister is nursing national ambitions once again _ this time with political strategist Prashant Kishore guiding the party, the Trinamul seems to be taking more confident steps in its attempts to spread wide and not thin. Visibility is now demanding a price from the Trinamul which the party never thought it would have to pay. Local level politicians in Goa are apparently impressed with the huge hoardings and banners that have been put on the roads connecting Panaji with Mapusa in the north and Margao in the south. “The huge banners from the Trinamul Congress have given rise to the impression that the party is a cash-rich one. That has evoked a lot of interest. Heads (Panchas) of villages and former heads are making demands for money to work for the party,” said a source. Mamata has always claimed that proceeds from her painting sales and royalties from the 102 books that she has written in Bengali, English, Urdu and translated into Alchiki, help fund her party's activities. Income records provided by the Trinamul which were published by the Association for Democratic Reforms revealed between the years 2010 to 2015, Rs 646.90 lakh was earned from sale of paintings, which accounted for 14 per cent of the party’s income. In the 2019-20 fiscal,  the party had received Rs 8,08,35,000 crore in donations from 63 donors as per the income-expenditure statement for the year. The way politics works in Goa suits the Trinamul’s style. In the ten years that Trinamul has governed in Bengal, it has managed to win over politicians from the Congress, the Left and also the BJP.  Goa has seen similar switchovers that made a mockery of elections. In 2017, for example, the Congress bagged the highest number of seats winning 17 out of the 40. The government however was formed by the BJP which allied with other local parties and then worked to engineer defections within the Congress. The Congress now is left with only four legislators. It is quite likely that the murky waters of Goan politics will turn murkier with the arrival of the mercurial Mamata Banerjee. The Trinamul can teach a lesson or two in defections to most political parties in the country. Since her stupendous victory in the Bengal polls, Mamata has stepped up the ante in projecting herself as the only viable alternative to the BJP’s Narendra Modi and has been systematically targeting the Congress leadership, especially Rahul Gandhi. While Mamata’s foray into other states is not new, this time there is a marked difference that the party has shown in picking up individuals. Like Sushmita Dev, who has been nominated for the Rajya Sabha from Bengal, but is most likely going to be the party’s face in Tripura. Her father, the late Santosh Mohan Dev, was the only Congressman, apart from a member of the Gandhi family, to have represented two different states in Parliament, Assam and Tripura. In Goa, the Trinamul has bagged the two-term former chief minister Luizinho Faleiro. “Doubts will remain. As the Congress leader, Faleiro could not keep his flock together, how can he be expected to bring Trinamul to power in a state which is completely alien to us?” asked a south Calcutta Trinamul leader. Faleiro, however, dismissed all misgivings about his new party in the state. “All surveys indicate people of Goa want a change and the only party that can provide a credible change is the Trinamul. We are working very hard towards that,” said Faleiro.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-54

Varsity officials said that Ramgarh, in scenic Nainital district, was among Rabindranath Tagore’s favoured destinations. Records indicate at least one visit with his entire family in 1914. Many of his poems on natural beauty are believed to have been written in Ramgarh, 1,729m above sea level. It is also said several verses of Gitanjali, for which he was awarded the Nobel in 1913, were penned in Ramgarh. “The central government had passed the bill in Parliament and the Centre’s junior minister of defence and tourism Ajay Bhatt recently wrote to the Uttarakhand chief minister to hand over 300 acres of land to Visva-Bharati after approval in the cabinet. We are planning to set up the campus as soon as possible. However, we need to estimate the cost too,” said a senior varsity official. Varsity sources said that the executive council had on June 10, 2020, approved the proposal for setting up the new campus at Ramgarh in Nainital district which has associations with Tagore. “The project was initiated by the ministry of human resource development under the keen supervision of former education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal. It was earlier fixed that the Uttarakhand government will provide the land and the HRD ministry will fund the project,” said an official. Visva-Bharati officials could not confirm whether the varsity can start its academic sessions in its satellite campus from this year.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-55

Gurung had launched the Morcha in 2007 to press for a separate state of Gorkhaland. Even though he settled for an autonomous Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) in 2011 after a long agitation, he continued to demand for statehood by holding more than 30 days of general strike in 2013 and another 104-day general strike in 2017. Gurung on Thursday said: “You might be thinking that Bimal Gurung will talk about Gorkhaland again. I will not. I will not talk today.” He reasoned his talk on Gorkhaland would only help others. “When I talk (on Gorkhaland) another (group) will stay in their chairs. For their benefit they will use my talk, my courage,” said Gurung. He was perhaps alluding to 2017, when his then colleagues, Binay Tamang and Anit Thapa, formed a new faction when Gurung was on the run following the Gorkhaland agitation. The duo developed ties with the state government and got nominated to the GTA. Gurung, who shared a blow-hot, blow-cold relationship with Mamata Banerjee till 2017, and decided to ally with her party last year, leaving long-time ally BJP, also said he would no longer make enemies with the government or the Opposition. “My politics will be for developing the place,” he said, adding that he had changed but his critics had not. “In the coming days I want to work with Bengal, she (Mamata Banerjee) has promised a permanent political solution for the region,” Gurung said. The BJP promised a permanent political solution in its 2019 Lok Sabha poll manifesto. Before Assembly polls, Mamata, too, promised the same. Gurung repeated that for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, his party will support anyone who works for the aspiration of the hills. “I had announced this (while joining Trinamul in October 2020) earlier,” he said. Many believe that Gurung is also leaving some space to raise the statehood issue. This is largely because despite joining hands with Trinamul, Gurung’s party came third in all the three Assembly seats of Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong in the recent Assembly elections. The results seem to be weighing heavy on his mind. “I came third, maybe we could not spread our message (to the hill people) but despite coming third, we will do first-class work for the people,” said Gurung adding that his priority would be to get minimum wages fixed for the tea garden workers.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-55

Twenty-four hours later, she has not been found. Kalna police, searching for her, informally spoke to the woman and her husband. No formal complaint has been filed yet. The incident occurred at  8.30pm on Wednesday, a little after the private ferry left Kalna Ghat in East Burdwan, with Tapashi Ghosh, 27, her husband Amit Ghosh, 34, and their two children, Trisha (14 months) and Arpan, 4, on board with passengers bound for Nadia’s Santipur. The couple from Santipur were returning home after a visit to a paediatrician in Kalna. Amit said that during the ferry ride, his wife suddenly fell ill and collapsed. The baby slipped out of her arms. A few passengers claimed the baby was pushed off. “The woman was seated comfortably, holding the baby on her lap. There was little chance of the baby falling into the river unless pushed,” an eyewitness said. Amit refuted these allegations. “People are blaming (Tapashi) without basis. How can a mother push her child? There is no tension in our family. The kids had fever. So, we took them to a paediatrician in Kalna. A terrible incident occurred when we were coming home,” said Amit, a weaver. Sources said the incident had left Tapashi so shocked and shaken that the police had to take her to a doctor in Santipur. A Kalna police officer said river Hooghly was in spate right now.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-55
08-10-2021||West Bengal||Female leopard flees from zoological park in Jhargram||Panic spread in and around Jhargram town after a leopard fled from its enclosure of a zoological park on Thursday evening. The female leopard, Harshini, 5, weighs around 40kg and was brought to the Jungle Mahal Zoological Park in Jhargram town three years ago from north Bengal. Police, the local administration and foresters made public awareness announcements from Thursday evening asking people to be alert and inform police or foresters if the animal was spotted. “An important piece of information for the people.... A leopard has fled by breaking its cage at Deer Park (the popular name of the zoological park). We request you all to be alert and safe. If you see any such animal, please inform the forest department or Jhargram police station,” police announced on mics. Birbaha Hansda, minister of state of forest department and Trinamul MLA from Jhargram, said the department would hold a thorough probe to find out who were responsible for the incident. “Our forest officials are searching for the leopard and we have sought help from the police. We will certainly conduct a probe as negligence led the animal to flee from a zone which is under 24/7 surveillance,” said Hansda. A forest official said there were two leopards in the enclosure but only one of them escaped. The official added that the wire fencing of the enclosure had been damaged and repair was on when the leopard fled. “Forest officials informed us around 4.30pm about its disappearance from the zoological park. We alerted all concerned to avert any mishap,” the official added. Pradip Sengupta, the range officer of Jhargram, said the leopard was missing from its enclosure and might cover a greater distance if not caught. “We have involved several teams with search lights and have fielded them at various strategic locations to spot the animal,” said Sengupta. “The forest department said in their letter that they realized the leopard was missing at around 4.30 pm but are not sure when the animal left the zoo premises. It proves that the staff of the zoo was lackadaisical,” said a district official. Divisional Forest officer of Jhargram, Sheik Fareed J., did not take calls or reply to a text message from this newspaper till late evening.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-55

This is the first time in recent memory that the governor administered the oath to MLAs, including Mamata and two others from Trinamul, Jakir Hossain and Amirul Islam. “One can call it a historic day as the governor administered the oath.… After the ceremony, the governor, along with the chief minister went to Speaker Biman Banerjee’s room, which was a rare occurrence,” said a Trinamul MLA. As the Trinamul leader who led her party to a thumping victory in the Assembly polls, Mamata had taken oath as chief minister on May 5, but as she had lost the election from Nandigram, she had to win a bypoll to continue as CM beyond November 5. She emphatically won the September 30 bypoll to Bhowanipore to become an MLA. No one from the Opposition was present during the swearing-in.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-55

08-10-2021||West Bengal||Kamtapur state demand rears its head again in hills||The Narendra Modi government’s decision to hold a meeting on the hill issue has prompted outfits and political parties of the Rajbanshi community reassert their demand for the Kamtapur state. On October 12, Union home minister Amit Shah will attend the meeting at North Block in Delhi for “resolution” of issues related to Gorkhas.” In recent years, this is the first-of-its-kind meeting that the Centre has convened on the issue which has been time and again flagged by the residents of Darjeeling hills. “Our demand for Kamtapur state is no less important that the demand of the hill people. After festivities are over, we want the Centre to convene a tripartite meeting to discuss our demands. We have carried out a number of political activities on the issue to draw the attention of the state and central governments during past few months. If required, we will resume our movement again,” said Manabendranath Roy, general secretary, Kamtapur Progressive Party. In north Bengal, the demand for statehood has been raised time and again by different organisations of the Rajbanshis. Altogether, around 85 lakh Rajbanshis, including Nasya Sheikhs or Rajbanshi Muslims, dwell in the region. They are close to 40 per cent of north Bengal’s population. Nikhil Roy, president of Kamtapur Peoples’ Party (United), another political party that has ben vocal on the demand said they do not want any autonomous arrangement in north Bengal. “If any such arrangement is made for hills, only hill residents will benefit while the rest of north Bengal will be deprived. That is why we want a state and the Gorkhas will also be a part of it,” said Roy. He said that a few months back, the issue had again gained pace as BJP MP John Barla, who is the Union minister of state for minority affairs now, had spoken on statehood. “We believe central leaders of the BJP will take due cognisance of our demand. Otherwise, we will be forced to launch a movement,” the Rajbanshi leader added. Like the two factions of KPP, leaders of Greater Cooch Behar Peoples’ Association (GCPA), have also spoken out. Bangshibadan Barman, who heads one of the factions of the GCPA, said the Centre should break its silence. Barman, who is an office bearer in the Rajbanshi Development & Cultural Board and Rajbanshi Bhasa Academy constituted by Mamata Banerjee to address some demands of the community including recognition of their language, said the Centre should meet the clauses of Cooch Behar’s merger with India. “It is high time that the Centre convenes a meeting and confers the status of a state to us according to the agreement signed between the India government and the royals of the then princely state of Cooch Behar which led to the merger in 1949,” he said. Political analysts of the region have termed the renewal of the demand by Rajbanshis an “obvious move” ahead of the October 12 meeting. They have also said it has come as a fresh poser for the BJP as there are differences within the party on the issue. “A section of party leaders supports the demand but many others oppose it. As these organisations want the Centre to act, it will be interesting to see how the BJP handles the situation. Moreover, if there is any development on the hill issue, there is no doubt that Rajbanshis will intensify their demand,” said an observer. Trinamul leaders sounded unperturbed. Their party is principally against any further division of Bengal, they said. “Mamata Banerjee has done a lot for the Rajbanshis and for north Bengal as a whole. Development work is going on and in no way has the region been deprived. We will keep on underscoring the development work carried out here. The BJP, however, will have to clarify its stand as the party is responsible for inciting a section of residents here with false promises,” said a party leader based in Cooch Behar.

08-10-2021||West Bengal||Sunderbans street theatre speaks for the mangroves||A theatre troupe from Nadia’s Krishnagar has enlisted the help of local theatre groups for to create awareness among residents of the Sunderbans delta on the need to stop illegal felling of trees in the mangroves to halt erosion. In its first phase, which began on October 3, members of the Krishnagar Sinchan troupe organised interactive street plays across remote areas of the region to make people understand the ecological importance of mangroves. The series, titled ‘O Nodi rey! (O river!)’ was staged at Satjelia, Kumirmari, Kalidaspur, Canning and other villages in South 24-Parganas with the support of theatre groups Marichjhanpi Golpata, Fulmalancha Katha Natya Sanstha, and the Sunderbans Puppet Theatre. Krishnagar Sinchan director Susanta Halder said: “It’s a collective effort for a great cause. The mangrove is a shield for the people of the Sunderbans. But unfortunately, that shield is not in a healthy state, and needs to be sustained with care and protection. We have taken up an initiative to convey this message among people, as unless they come forward, nothing can work to save the mangroves.” “It is easier to reach people through theatre, as hard facts can be made clear in a palatable, even enjoyable way,” Halder added further. The Sunderbans are a cluster of islands in the Bay of Bengal, spanning the coastline of West Bengal and Bangladesh. The forest delta hosts the world’s largest mangrove, with an area of about 1,000 sq km of which 60 per cent is in Bangladesh. The mangrove functions as a shield during cyclones too. But the decaying mangrove owing to illegal felling and large-scale erosion are a serious worry for survival and safety of residents. “We never heard the importance of mangroves put forth so simply,” said Nimai Biswas, a resident of Satjelia, who watched a few street acts. A member of the Sinchan troupe said: “We are just trying to make people feel the need for mangroves, the river and nature around them. That’s their lifeline. We used street theatre to touch their hearts.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-56
08-10-2021||West Bengal||BJP central leadership retains losers’ team in Bengal||The BJP central leadership has retained its team Bengal, with party’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya as the minder for the state along with Arvind Menon and Amit Malviya as his deputies, despite the Assembly poll drubbing. The decision came as a shock for the majority in the party’s Bengal unit who were rooting for a change. On Thursday, the BJP released a list of its newly formed National Executive Committee, where Vijayvargiya, Menon and Malviya have been reinstated as the three people in charge of Bengal. “Does this mean our leaders in Delhi have no regard for our views at all?” asked a state BJP functionary. “We are the ones who fight on the streets. We don’t want Kailashji here any longer. Yet, he has been made our minder again,” he added. A majority in the state unit held Vijayvargiya, who had helmed the party's election strategy, responsible for the poor show in Bengal Assembly polls. The state BJP leaders think that Vijayvargiya’s strategy of allowing turncoats from all hues into the saffron camp cost the party dear. “Kailashji was in-charge of distributing tickets during the Assembly polls. Nothing could be worse than the choices he made. At least 50 workers died in the post-poll violence and he didn’t bother to come,” a source in the BJP said. On Thursday, Trinamul turncoat Sabyasachi Dutta left the BJP and re-joined Trinamul in the presence of state ministers Partha Chatterjee and Firhad Hakim at the Bengal legislative Assembly. Vijayvargiya  had played a key role in Dutta’s induction. Several leaders from Bengal like Swapan Dasgupta, Debasree Chaudhuri, Anirban Ganguly, Dilip Ghosh, Jayanta Roy, Bharati Ghosh, Ashok Lahiri and Roopa Ganguly were included in the BJP national executive committee. Rajib Banerjee, who had recently been vocal against BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari and the party, also found a berth. BJP also announced its candidates for the bypolls, Ashok Mandal for Dinhata, Niranjan Biswas for Santipur, Joy Saha for Khardaha and Palash Rana for Gosaba. Biswas’s nomination created a new controversy within BJP, with sources close to Ranaghat MP Jagannath Sarkar claiming that Biswas doesn't share a rapport with Sarkar. After the poll debacle, the BJP Bengal leadership, a state leader said, had conveyed to Delhi that they would be better off without Vijayvargiya and his deputies. “After election results, Kailash-ji stopped coming to Bengal, while Menon got busy in his family life and Malviya has been active only in social media. We heaved a sigh of relief... But they are back and it's very sad,” said a BJP MLA. Amid the despondency, a BJP source said that there was still some hope as the list of observers may be changed soon. “Our state chief Sukanta Majumdar has been retained as observer for Sikkim, but since he has been promoted as the president of the Bengal unit he would no longer be the minder for another state. So, there is scope for more changes and that’s the only hope for us," said the source. On the issue of Dutta's resignation from the party, Majumdar said it would not affect the BJP since the defector had “no connection with workers whatsoever”. “However Trinamul appears to have forgotten that the legislative Assembly is a constitutional body. To hand over a party flag to someone inside the Assembly is an insult to democracy,” he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-56
