Karimganj superintendent of police Mayank Kumar told The Telegraph on Sunday evening that five persons, two from Tripura’s North district and three from Karimganj district, have been arrested based on the complaint lodged by the two women in their thirties. “We have arrested five of the accused, the first one on Saturday, through coordinated operations with Tripura police. The victims said they were returning home in a hired Tata Indica along with another person after visiting the mother of one of the women in Silchar Medical College and Hospital. The women are not related. We are probing all angles,” Kumar said. Sources said the four occupants of the car had dinner at a dhaba at Cheragi around 11pm. The driver took a “short-cut” to Churaibari but instead took them to the building where the three other accused were present. Sources said the accused allegedly took away all the belongings of the victims after the crime.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-36
