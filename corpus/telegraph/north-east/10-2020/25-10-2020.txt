This development might prompt other states to revisit their move to reopen schools and colleges in November. Mizoram education minister Lalchhandama Ralte said the decision to close down schools to check the spread of Covid-19 was taken after a meeting of department officials and teachers’ representatives.  If everything remains normal, they will reopen schools again on November 9. However, online classes will continue for Class X and XII students. An education department official told The Telegraph that at least 18 students from four schools had tested positive since schools reopened on October 16 after the  lockdown. Mizoram has registered 2,359 positive cases till Friday but there have been no deaths.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-39
