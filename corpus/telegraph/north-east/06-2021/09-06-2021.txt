The decision was taken at a meeting of stakeholders with state education minister Ranoj Pegu  here on Tuesday. Pegu said both the state board exams will be held as the Covid-19 situation was showing signs of improvement. The exams, scheduled for May, had to be put off because of the alarming rise in Covid-19 cases since April. “Both the matric and higher secondary final examinations of the state will be held ...if necessary with reduced number of subjects or reduced total marks. The modalities of how to go about it will be announced soon after discussion with the chief minister,” Pegu said. Pegu said there would be a window in July-August to hold the examinations. Sources who attended the exam-related meeting chaired by the minister said the government was looking to wrap up the exams within August 10 and declare the results by September 5. Pegu assured that everyone associated with the  examinations, including students, teachers, school and college staff and drivers, would be vaccinated. “A detailed examination-related SOP will be released soon,” the first-time minister said. It is not clear how students appearing for the Class X exam will be vaccinated since they would be under 18. The vaccines available in the country now are only for adults. Till Monday, Assam reported 3,803 new Covid-19 cases and 37 fresh fatalities  with the caseload rising to 4,38,746,||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-3
