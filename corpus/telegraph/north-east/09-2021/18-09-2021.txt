Not in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan but in Assam. Jublee Tamuli faced this on Wednesday when she sat for the entrance exam of the state-run Assam Agricultural University. Jublee told The Telegraph on Friday evening that she had written to Assam education minister Ranoj Pegu about the “humiliation” she was subjected to at the Girijananda Chowdhury Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (GIPS) in Tezpur. “I was wearing shorts and a T-shirt. I was not allowed to enter the exam hall despite having all the documents by the invigilators, who said short dresses were not allowed. I was told to make alternative arrangements. When I told them that no dress code had been mentioned in the admit card, they said it was common sense,” Jublee said. “Two girls gave me a curtain so that I could cover my legs and sit for the exam. They too abused me for turning up the way I did,” she said. The two male invigilators were GIPS employees. AAU registrar Tapan Kumar Gohain said: “We have set up a three-member inquiry committee to get to the bottom of the matter and submit a report in 10 days.” He said there was no dress code.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-5
