Two senior government functionaries said the task has been given to the North Eastern Space Application Centre (NESAC), a joint initiative of the Department of Space (DoS) and the North Eastern Council (NEC). The NESAC helps augment the developmental process in the Northeast region by providing advanced space technology support. The inter-state border disputes have come under fresh focus recently after six Assam Police personnel were killed in clashes along the Assam-Mizoram border. The idea for demarcation of inter-state boundaries through satellite imaging was mooted by Union Home Minister Amit Shah a few months ago. Mr Shah had suggested roping in NESAC for mapping the inter-state borders and forests in the Northeastern region and coming up with a scientific demarcation of boundaries between states. The Shillong-based NESAC is already using space technology for flood management in the region. Since there will be scientific methods in the demarcation of borders, there will be no scope for any discrepancy and there shall be better acceptability of the boundary solutions by the states, the government functionaries said. Once the satellite mapping is done, the boundaries of Northeastern states could be drawn and the disputes could be resolved permanently, they said. The major objectives of the NESAC are: to provide an operational remote sensing and geographic information system-aided natural resource information base to support activities on development, management of natural resources and infrastructure planning in the region. It provides operational satellite communication applications services in the region in education, health care, disaster management support, and developmental communication. The other objectives include taking up research in the area of space and atmospheric science and establishing an instrumentation hub and networking with various academic institutions of the region. Also, to enable single window delivery of all possible space-based support for disaster management and to set up a regional level infrastructure for capacity building in the field of geospatial technology.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-14

The visit of Banerjee, nephew of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and defacto number two in the party, comes days after a controversy had erupted over "detention" of poll strategist Prashant Kishor's I-PAC team in an Agartala hotel room by the police, citing COVID-19 restrictions. The incident prompted back-to-back visits to Tripura by TMC leaders, including West Bengal ministers Bratya Basu and Malay Ghatak and TMC MP Derek O'Brien, who decried the "illegal detention of young boys and girls" of a professional firm. Banerjee will offer prayers at the Tripureswari temple in Agartala during the day, hold a meeting with party members and address the media in the afternoon, sources in the TMC said. Elections in the northeastern state are slated to be held in 2023. Deputy leader of TMC in Rajya Sabha, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, told PTI, "Abhishek will lead the party's journey in Tripura where Bengalis and other communities are rooting for us, our leader Mamata Banerjee. They are frustrated with the performance of the Biplab Deb-led BJP government. " The "landslide victory of the TMC in West Bengal on the face of BJP blitzkrieg" has encouraged a majority of Bengali voters in Tripura to pledge their support for Mamata Banerjee, the parliamentarian said. Abhishek Banerjee is immensely popular among Tripura electorate -- youth and women in particular. He will chalk out the road map of our Tripura journey, he added. Veteran TMC leader and Lok Sabha MP Sougata Roy claimed that "Abhishek's visit will be the precursor to the storm that will be raised by our supremo Mamata Banerjee in Tripura in the near future". Making light of the visit by TMC national general secretary, Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh pointed out that the Mamata Banerjee-led party has no base anywhere outside this state. "In the past, too, the TMC had made futile attempts to gain foothold in Tripura. They (TMC leaders) are still day dreaming people of Tripura, including Bengalis, stand solidly behind the BJP. The TMC should protect its flock in Bengal, where the BJP has increased its assembly tally to 77 from just three," he added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-14
01-08-2021||North East||Former Manipur Congress chief joins BJP||Former Manipur Congress president Govindas Konthoujam joined the BJP on Sunday, saying he was impressed with the Modi government's development work for the region. He joined the BJP in the presence of Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh, state BJP chief A Sharda Devi, Rajya Sabha MP Anil Baluni and the party's in-charge for the state Sambit Patra, among others. A six-time consecutively elected MLA from the Bishnupur seat, Konthoujam had quit the Congress a few days back and his decision to join the saffron party would be a boost to it ahead of the assembly elections in the state early next year. The chief minister, who was also in the Congress before joining the BJP, called Konthoujam a friend and asserted that more leaders will be joining the party. People of Manipur like the Modi government's agenda for the entire northeast's development, he said, noting that the presence of five ministers from the region in his dispensation showed the attention and care it had given to the place. Manipur was associated with frequent blockades, violence and strikes but since the BJP came to power in the state in 2017, progress and peace have prevailed, he added. Patra described Konthoujam as a well-known face from the northeast region and referred to his vast administrative and legislative experience.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-14

Assam Chief Minister Sarma, who has been charged with criminal conspiracy and attempt to murder in an FIR by Mizoram Police, also spoke of keeping alive the spirit of the North East in a twitter post. The tweet comes after Union Home Minister Amit Shah spoke to both Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and Mizoram CM Zoramthanga telephonically earlier in the day to defuse the border tension between the two Northeastern neighbours. "Our main focus is on keeping the spirit of North-East alive. What happened along the Assam-Mizoram border is unacceptable to the people of both states. "Honble CM @ZoramthangaCM had promised to call me post his quarantine. Border disputes can only be resolved through discussion," Sarma said in his tweet. Despite an attempt by Shah to resolve the long standing border disuptes between Assam and its neighbours earlier this month through a meeting he chaired, at least six Assam Police personnel and one civilian were killed while defending a disputed boundary with Mizoram and more than 50 people injured, including the police chief of the district of Cachar. The Mizoram police had lodged an FIR against Sarma and six Assam officials under various charges, including charges of attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy, at Vairengte police station. The Assam Police has also issued summons to six officials of Mizoram government, including the deputy commissioner and superintendent of police of Kolasib district, and ordered them to appear at Dholai police station on Monday.

Five Assam Police personnel and a civilian were killed and over 50 others including a superintendent of police were injured when the Mizoram Police opened fire on a team of the Assam officials on July 26 following clashes along the two states' border. While the Mizoram government claimed that a 509 square-mile stretch of the inner-line reserve forest notified in 1875 under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation of 1873 belongs to it, the Assam side insisted that the constitutional map and boundary, drawn by the Survey of India in 1993, was acceptable to it. After a massive tussle in 2018, the border row resurfaced in August last year and then in February this year. However, the escalating tensions were successfully defused after a series of parleys with the intervention of the Centre. On June 5, two abandoned houses along the Mizoram-Assam border were burnt down by unidentified persons, fuelling tension along the volatile inter-state border. Nearly a month after this incident, a fresh border standoff cropped up again with both trading charges of encroachment on each other lands.

The situation in and around Lailapur, which was rocked by deadly violence, along the interstate border remained calm with a large number of CRPF troops patrolling the National Highway-306, they said. An all-party delegation, led by Assam Chief Minister's Political Secretary Jayanta Malla Baruah, visited the house of one slain Assam Police personnel and praised the valour of the force in handling the situation on Monday. Officials in Assam's Barak Valley said the vehicular movement has totally been stopped even though there is no bar in travelling from one state to the other. Dozens of trucks with essential supplies, including Covid-19 materials, are waiting at the Kabuganj-Dholai stretch in Cachar district. “The organised blockade on roads leading to Mizoram were lifted and no group is now on the streets to stop trucks or other vehicles. But aggrieved civilians are now stopping vehicles. Also, trucks and other commercial vehicles are not taking any risk and they themselves are not trying to move,” an official said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-14

Even Chief Minister Zoramthanga did not approve the inclusion of Sarma's name in the FIR, he said. "In fact, our chief minister did not really approve of mentioning the name of the Assam chief minister in the FIR. He suggested to me that we should look into it," he told reporters. Chuango said that he will discuss the matter with police officials concerned and remove the name of the Assam chief minister if there is no legal validity to substantiate the allegations against him. "I will hold discussion with the police officer who filed the FIR, and if there is no legal fit, we would like to remove the name of Assam chief minister from the FIR," he said, adding that he was unaware of the development when the criminal case was filed against Sarma. The chief secretary, however, did not mention whether the cases filed against six Assam officials and 200 unidentified police personnel will be withdrawn. The Mizoram Police booked Sarma, four senior Assam Police officers and two officials on different charges, including 'attempt to murder', 'criminal conspiracy' and 'assault'. The FIR was registered at the Vairengte police station by its officer-in-charge Lalchawimawia on July 26 soon after the violent clash with the Assam Police. At least seven people from Assam, including six police personnel, were killed in the violence amid the border dispute between the two Northeastern states.

During the phone call, it was decided to resolve the border issue amicably through meaningful dialogue, Zoramthanga said. "As per telephonic discussion with Union Home Minister and Assam Chief Minister, we agreed to resolve the Mizoram-Assam border issue amicably through meaningful dialogue," he tweeted. Zoramthanga also urged the people of Mizoram to refrain from posting provocative messages and misuse of social media in order to de-escalate the ongoing tension. "In the meantime, in order to prevent any possible escalation of the situation, I request the people of Mizoram to avoid posting sensitive messages and make judicious use of social media platform," he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-15

A flare-up on the contested border between Assam and Mizoram that led to the death of six policemen on Monday prompted Assam and Nagaland to find ways to ease tensions, sources said. Assam has border disputes with four of the six states it shares its boundary with — Nagaland, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh. Flare-ups have become frequent of late, affecting life and traffic along the border. The police forces of Assam and Nagaland had been locked in an “eyeball-to-eyeball” confrontation since May-end, sources said. Under the pact, they will retreat from the disputed area simultaneously. The minutes of the meeting at which the pact was signed, accessed by The Telegraph, said the agreement was reached to de-escalate tensions in the disputed Dessoi Valley Reserved Forest/ Tsurangkong Valley. Both states claim this area as their own. While Assam calls the area Dessoi Valley, Nagaland identifies it as Tsurangkong Valley. The agreement was signed by Nagaland chief secretary Jan Alam and his Assam counterpart Jishnu Baruah at the Chumukedima Police House in Nagaland in the presence of Nagaland deputy chief minister Y. Patton and Assam education minister Ranuj Pegu. The key features of the agreement are: ⚫ As part of steps towards maintaining peace in areas around Ao Senden village and Vikuto village (as known in Nagaland) and Jankhona Nala and Nagajankha and Compartment No. 12 (as known in Assam), both states will withdraw their security personnel “simultaneously” from their present locations to their respective base camps “in the next 24 hours as far as possible”. ⚫ The police superintendents of Mokokchung (Nagaland) and Jorhat (Assam) shall ensure orderly withdrawal of the respective forces. ⚫ Both states will carry out surveillance of the area using unmanned aerial vehicles and satellite imagery to maintain status quo. The Assam-Nagaland border is 512km long. Border disputes started after the state of Nagaland was carved out of Assam in 1963. Assam’s Jorhat, Sivasagar, Charaideo, Golaghat and Karbi Anglong districts border Nagaland. Efforts have been made by the Centre and the states since 1971 to resolve the dispute. Assam moved the Supreme Court in 1988. The apex court has asked the two states to maintain status quo till a final solution is found. While Assam insists on going by the constitutional boundary decided in 1963, Nagaland wants to go by its “historical boundary” comprising Naga-inhabited areas till 1826, the year the British annexed Assam. The British India government created the Naga Hills district as part of its Assam province in 1866. According to Assam’s revenue department, people from Nagaland have encroached on 19,819.62 hectares. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma tweeted on Saturday that a “major breakthrough” had been achieved towards de-escalating tensions at the Assam-Nagaland border. Sarma thanked Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio for the “historic step”, adding that Assam was committed to ensuring peace along all its borders.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-15
01-08-2021||North East||Amit Shah launches afforestation drive to restore ecology of Sohra||Union home minister Amit Shah last week launched a mega afforestation drive to restore the ecology of Sohra, earlier known as Cherrapunjee, a tourist destination in Meghalaya which once had the distinction of being the wettest place on earth. The first-of-its-kind initiative of the National People’s Party (NPP)-led Meghalaya government is “aimed at bringing together” the Union ministry of home affairs (including defence officials), its own officials and village communities for a “novel and humanitarian” cause of natural resource management in what is considered a “very important and ecologically fragile landscape”. In addition to ecological restoration of the Sohra plateau, the project is expected to address the area’s water shortage during the dry season, boost tourism, provide livelihood to the local populace and enhance resilience to climate change. Launching the Green Sohra Afforestation Campaign to be run by the Meghalaya government with the help of Assam Rifles at Sohra, Shah said earlier Cherrapunjee, around 56km from Shillong, used to receive rainfall throughout the year, but the situation has changed because of indiscriminate harvesting in the name of development. Shah said an ambitious project to “make Cherrapunjee green again has started’ and the entire area is going to be adopted by Assam Rifles for the purpose of plantation. The Sohra plateau, spread over an area of about 39,000 hectares, receives average annual rainfall of 11,000-12,000mm. “Trees are cut for fuel and other uses. So 80 per cent of the total land will be planted with traditional and long lifespan trees. The remaining 20 per cent will be used for animal feed, ornamental plants and nursery which will meet all the requirements and help reduce the felling of long lifespan trees...,” Shah said. The project will greatly benefit eco-tourism in Meghalaya, Shah said while underlining the need to fight global warming and climate change. Officials said the project is an outcome of Shah’s interest in restoring Sohra’s ecosystem during a visit to Shillong in January. An official of the chief minister’s office said the trigger for launching the project are the ecological challenges which are evident from the large barren areas in the Sohra plateau, water crisis apart from the rainy season and severe soil erosion in barren areas during heavy rainfall causing sedimentation in streams and other waterbodies. The project will see block plantations in 3,000 hectares — fuelwood in 2,000 hectares and broom grass in 1,000 hectares — and 50,000 ornamental trees to enhance the tourism potential. The project will also see establishment of 14 nurseries, forest fire control measures and capacity building of local communities in natural resource management. “The plantations, which also include aromatic plants, would be completed within three years and maintenance support would be provided for up to five years. We plan to cover 1,000 hectares in the first year but the target is to cover 10,000 hectares,” the official said. Exbucklandia populnea (pipli in Hindi and Diengdoh in Khasi), betula alnoides (bhojpatra in Hindi and Dienglieng in Khasi), engelhardtia spicata (mauwa in Hindi and Dieng lyba in Khasi) and eugenia jambolana (jamun in Hindi and Diengsohum in Khasi) are some of the species that will be planted as part of the drive. Minister for development of north eastern region (DoNER) G. Kishan Reddy, minister of state for science and technology and department of space Jitendra Singh, minister of state (DoNER) B.L. Verma, Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma and senior central and state government officials were present during the launch. Shah met the chief ministers and senior officials of the northeastern states to review law and order, border disputes, use of space technology for development and mitigating disasters and drug trafficking. He urged the chief ministers to launch a coordinated effort for development and check law and order. Shah also laid the foundation stone of Tamulpur Medical College under the Bodoland Territorial Region in Assam through videoconference and also handed over cheques to the families of Covid-19 victims at a function in Guwahati.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-15
