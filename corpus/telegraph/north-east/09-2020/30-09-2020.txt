NPF legislature party leader and former chief minister T.R. Zeliang had “valuable discussion” in Guwahati on Monday on the Naga political issue and “appreciated” the central government’s “idea for roping” in Sarma to usher in peace in the region. “Sarma’s involvement in the peace process is a big boon to the Naga people and the Northeast region in general as he is someone who understands and knows the sentiments of the people in the region. A permanent peace is what the Naga people desire...,” the statement said. Zeliang is also the convener of the NPF Political Affairs Mission that is facilitating the peace process and apprised Sarma on its activities like the meetings with NSCN (I-M) and Naga National Political Groups and various apex civil organisations of Nagaland. An eight-member NPF team left for Delhi on Tuesday morning to meet central leaders in connection with the ongoing talks with NSCN (I-M), party sources said. The delegation will also meet the collective leadership of NSCN (I-M) to discuss the competency clauses of the Framework Agreement, the NPF said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-42
