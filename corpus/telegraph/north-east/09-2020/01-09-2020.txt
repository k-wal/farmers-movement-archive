Katakey, who heads the National Green Tribunal committee examining issues related to the gas well blowout, to ensure early release of the financial compensation to the affected people. Satyajit Moran and Hemanta Moran of Baghjan Gaon Milanjyoti Yuba Sangha, a local NGO which has been representing the affected people in talks with Oil India Limited and Tinsukia district administration, said they had no option but to undertake the eight-hour journey from Baghjan to Guwahati after their pleas and protests to secure financial compensation, among others, failed to make the desired headway.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-47
