Central banks should steer clear of politically-driven unlegislated areas such as "green" investments, as their mandates of providing financial and monetary stability are already quite wide, Rajan told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Wednesday. "Asking the central bank to say you should buy only green bonds, not brown bonds, etc., is asking the central bank to impose its own views on something which is primarily a fiscal matter," he said. Rajan, who earlier served as chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, said central banks should instead turn their focus to the financial stability of these green investments and other threats such as crypto currencies and cyber security. Crypto currencies have a "potential future," particularly well-regulated stablecoins, Rajan said, but it wasn't clear what fundamentals were backing their valuations other than a "heady environment," with easy monetary policy fuelling all asset prices. Cryptos won't be "your last resort" in a doomsday scenario, he said. "I would be much more confident about the value of these cryptos once they find proper use cases," such as an effective means of payment, especially in cross-border transactions. Rajan, who is professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, did not expect markets to react in a 2013-style "taper tantrum" as the U.S. Federal Reserve unveils its plan to withdraw stimulus, which he said was unlikely to happen at Jackson Hole on Friday. read more "Ideally, the Fed would like to observe as long as possible, (and) ... make sure that the economy is well on track towards growth, he said. "Of course, the problem is the Delta variant, plus whatever variants are lurking in the background." He expected inflationary pressures in the United States to be transitory, but said prices may remain elevated for longer than expected due to strong wages, unavailability of workers, and additional fiscal stimulus measures. "Firms are feeling confident enough to pass through price increase ... they don't do that until they think that these higher prices are to stay," Rajan said. Referring to India, Rajan said inflation there could rise in the short term as pent-up demand takes hold, resulting in supply-side bottlenecks, but demand will fall over the medium-term due to stressed households and economic scarring from the pandemic. Central banks in many emerging countries are being proactive and raising interest rates, Rajan said. "Now, obviously, the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) is watching the data and it will make the decision when it when it has to make it."

In the other hand, Bharti Airtel, Maruti, SBI, PowerGrid, NTPC and Tata Steel were among the laggards. "Indian market started flat to marginally negative following negative Asian market cues as South Korea's central bank hiked interest rates, making it the first developed economy to do so in the pandemic era," said Narendra Solanki, Head- Equity Research (Fundamental), Anand Rathi. During the afternoon session, markets attempted a comeback following buying in blue chip stocks from across various sectors, he said, adding that sentiments were positive amid reports that Indian economic growth will likely touch a record high in the June quarter.

"Additionally, minutes of the MPC meeting continue to show RBI's commitment to ensure policy support to sustain economic recovery despite select members showing some apprehensions about high inflation and pitching for gradual normalization in ultra-loose monetary policy.

At the close of trade, the market valuation of TCS stood at Rs 13,53,667.85 crore on the BSE.

A Reuters poll of analysts has shown that the stock market rally is expected to cool next year as global and domestic monetary policy starts to tighten. The poll has predicted the Sensex index would gain 2.4 per cent to 56875 by the end of 2021 from Monday’s close of 55555.79. This year’s estimated gain of just over 19 per cent would be the highest since 2017.

A board meeting was scheduled to put in place a crisis management team six days after MD and CEO Nitin Chugh resigned amid signs of a clash of culture between the old and new guard at the fledgling bank that started operations in 2017. After Chugh vacates office on September 30, 2021, Furtado will take charge as the interim CEO, subject to RBI approval. The board will continue to hunt for suitable candidates to the post in parallel and will submit two names to the RBI for its approval. With over 25 years of experience in microfinance and retail banking, Furtado was one of the key members of the leadership team that laid the foundation and built Ujjivan and  has been part of Ujjivan group since 2005. Ujjivan founder Samit Ghosh who was reappointed on the bank’s board as a non-executive, non independent director to address the concerns of deteriorating asset quality during Covid pandemic and top level attritions and to oversee the reverse merger process, said that the bank will conduct an independent portfolio quality and process audit. He also expressed confidence in Furtado being able to manage the challenges. “Carol has been our go-to person during any major crisis. I am sure she will lead us out of this Covid crisis with flying colours. We do not foresee any near term major issues in the portfolio quality of the bank. With the provision coverage ratio of 75 per cent, the highest in the industry, we are very well positioned. The bank is undertaking an independent portfolio quality and process audit. We look towards streamlining  the provisioning  policy. We are  confident of strengthening the organisation and emerge as  a stronger Ujjivan,” Ghosh said. The bank also informed the bourses that its board on Wednesday approved the appointment of Banavar Anantharamaiah Prabhakar, who is an additional director (independent), as the part-time chairman of the bank to fill the vacancy caused due to the  resignation of  Biswamohan Mahapatra, subject to the prior approval of the RBI. The bank’s board has also approved the recategorisation  of the directorship of Rajesh Kumar Jogi from additional director (non-executive, non-independent) to additional director (independent) effective from August 25, 2021. The bank will hold its fifth annual general meeting on September 27, 2021. Addressing the concerns of market analysts last week on the implications of the change of management and further attrition, Ghosh had clarified that the bank will not change its direction following the departure of Chugh. “Nitin has hired a lot of people who are there in the organisation still and we have to make sure that those who want to stay with us will stay on and we certainly will not change our direction in terms of building the mass-market bank based on technology  and digitization, etc., so  that will certainly continue and it is certainly not going to go back to the pre Nitin days because we have  moved  ahead  quite  a  bit  and  we  will  move  further  beyond  that  line  and  we  will  stay the course we are not going to change the course,” Ghosh had said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-94

McLeod Russel, which was represented by legal eagle Abhishek Manu Singhvi, argued that the NCLT had erred in admitting Techno Electric’s petition while contending that there had been no default in the repayment of a Rs 100 crore loan accessed in 2018 because it had been backed by adequate assets that had been stumped up as collateral. Singhvi argued before the NCLAT bench that a committee of creditors — the first step towards initiating a bankruptcy resolution process — ought not to be formed until its appeal against the recent NCLT order was disposed of. The NCLAT bench, which also heard Kapil Sibal who represented Techno Electric, said it was ready to pass an order in the dispute but it wasn’t uploaded until the time this newspaper went to press. Singhvi built part of his argument around a clause in the loan agreement between the two parties on September 28, 2018 which stated no recovery process could be initiated until Techno had exhausted its option of selling the two properties pledged with it against the loan. McLeod argued that Techno could not proceed against the tea producer until it had exercised its right to sell the mortgaged properties and came up short on loan recovery. Sibal countered by saying that the matter had become irrelevant after the loan default and reminded the tribunal that a mere contract could not override the provisions of the IBC statute. The appellate tribunal was informed that the value of the two properties that had been mortgaged against the loan were worth Rs 113 crore — which was greater than the loan amount. The mortgaged assets included the 4, Sunny Park plot in Calcutta which is valued at about Rs 87 crore. Singhvi said under the terms of the agreement,Techno could proceed against McLeod only if it came up short after enforcing its right to sell the mortgaged properties. Techno had not moved to enforce the securities, Singhvi contended. As a consequence, McLeod could not be construed to be in default. He also argued that Techno had assigned the debt to a third party and could not as a result claim to be a creditor under Section 7 of Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code -- the provision that Techno had relied on while buttressing its right to proceed against McLeod. Techno Electric and Engineering is promoted by P.P. Gupta. Sibal argued that McLeod had admitted that it had taken the loan and had failed to return the amount. The missing entry in Techno Electric's balance sheet — reflecting the loan assignment to a third party — did not alter McLeod's liability. He argued the debt repayment had been delayed by two years and McLeod was trying to defer it further.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-95

The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the FDI proposal specifically for the purpose of investment in infrastructure and the construction-development sectors. These may include transport and logistics, along with downstream investment in the airport sector and aviation-related businesses and services. Anchorage Infrastructure is the investment arm of billionaire Prem Watsa’s Fairfax India for airports and other infrastructure investments. Fairfax India has a 54 per cent stake in Bangalore International Airport Ltd. The investment includes transfer of share of Bangalore International Airport Limited to Anchorage. Besides, an arm of Canada pension fund giant Omers  is investing Rs 950 crore in Anchorage. The investment will also be a shot in the arm for the recently announced National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP). It will help fund lease of state-owned infrastructure assets, which involve handling assets such as roads, railways, airports, sports stadiums, power transmission lines and gas pipelines, to private operators. Anchorage Infrastructure Investment Holding is proposing to make a downstream investment in some of the sectors covered under the NMP. Sugarcane price The Centre on Wednesday increased the minimum price sugar mills pay to sugarcane growers by Rs 5 to Rs 290 per quintal for the marketing year starting October, but ruled out any immediate increase in the sale price of sugar. The decision to increase the fair and remunerative price of sugarcane  was taken in the cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The government had fixed sugarcane FRP at Rs 285 per quintal this year.

The spouse or a nominee of the deceased will get a monthly pension of Rs 30,000 per month to Rs 35,000 per month against a maximum of Rs 9,284 per month at present, financial services secretary Debasish Panda said in Mumbai on Wednesday. “The cap has been completely removed and a uniform slab of 30 per cent at the last-drawn salary will be entitled as family pension,” Panda told reporters here, admitting that the earlier levels were “paltry”. However, the sum refers to the highest pension slab. The revised pension amount will range from Rs 8000 per month to a sum which could be as much as Rs 40,000 per month, C.H Venkatachalam, general secretary of the AIBEA claimed. The union leader said there were about 75,000 family pensioners. Besides, bank contribution to employees’ pension under the new pension scheme (NPS) has been raised to 14 per cent of salary from 10 per cent, while employee contribution stays the same at 10 per cent of salary. NPS is for employees who have joined after April 2010, and will benefit 60 per cent of staff.

Even without awaiting indications, we have taken steps to ramp up credit,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters in Mumbai where she is reviewing the performance of PSU banks. A report by CARE Ratings shows credit growth slouching at 5-6 per cent rate since March last year, way below the smart double digit growth that prevailed till June 2019. While announcing the district-wise loan outreach programme by the PSU banks, the finance minister said there was a need to ramp up credit growth in the eastern pockets of the country in states such as Jharkhand, Bengal and Odisha. Banks have also been asked to create state-wise plans for northeastern states to help the logistics sector and exporters. “The government will have a bare minimum presence in the strategic sectors. Banks and financial services have been identified as strategic sectors. The government  will look at amalgamating or selling government stakes in insurance firms over and above a bare minimum presence,” Sitharaman said. Finance secretary T.V. Somanathansaid the government is considering insurance bonds as an alternative to bank guarantee. Guarantees are usually asked for extending a loan and typically require a collateral. An insurance bond is also a surety but does not require any collateral. The government may also introduce legislative amendments in the budget session of Parliament to enable Indian companies to directly list certain prescribed classes of securities abroad.  “There are certain issues which need to be sorted out for this to become a success,” revenue secretary Tarun Bajaj said on Wednesday.

Sources said he will meet All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary K C Venugopal.  The sources said some Congress MLAs are also heading to Delhi in an apparent show of support to the chief minister amid talks of a change in leadership.  The Congress which returned to power in the state after 15 years in 2018 is witnessing a tussle between Baghel and Health Minister T S Singh Deo who has staked his claim to the post of chief minister citing a post-poll agreement on rotating chief ministership.  Baghel and Deo had met Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday. They again held discussions with Venugopal on Wednesday.  When contacted, AICC in-charge for Chhattisgarh P L Punia told PTI, "Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel will be in the national capital tomorrow as he had sought time from the AICC general secretary."  Punia, however, clarified that no MLA has been called to Delhi and rejected media reports to this effect.  Baghel had left Delhi on Wednesday and was accorded a rousing welcome in Raipur, where a large number of Congress leaders and MLAs were present in an apparent show of support.  Baghel has said that Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have entrusted him with the responsibility of running the state government and he will quit the moment they ask him to do so.  On his return to Raipur, he also said that those seeking a rotating chief ministership are creating political instability in the state.

The Drone Rules, 2021, were issued on Wednesday and they supersede the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Rules, 2021, which had come into force on March 12. In the absence of a drone policy, these devices were not registered and also there were no demarcations on where they should be flown, Principal Scientific Advisor K Vijay Raghavan said. The new norms prescribe registration of all drones and there will be a specific tracking mechanism, he said during a press conference. Responding to a question on misuse of drones and security risk, Civil Aviation Secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola said, "We have the facility to identify a rogue drone and this is what these rules provide for." He explained that every car has a registration number and there is a mechanism to know who owns it. "Something similar will happen with drones. The rules have a provision that in the future, each drone will have an identification. The first challenge is to identify a good drone and a bad drone," Kharola said. "Once a bad drone is identified there are protocols in place. It is not only the civil aviation ministry, but other ministries and agencies are working together to ensure that once such an identification is done how to deal with that," he said. The civil aviation ministry has eased rules regarding drone operations in the country by reducing the number of forms that need to be filled to operate them from 25 to 5 and decreasing the types of fee charged from the operator from 72 to 4.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-272

"We will not compromise (on the investigation)," he said. Bommai also disapproved of the comments made by Karnataka Home Minister Araga Jnanendra that the girl and her male friend should not have gone to the deserted place and that the opposition Congress was trying to "rape" him by targeting him over the incident. "I just don't agree with the comments made by my Home Minister regarding the gang-rape incident. I have advised him to give clarification," the chief minister said, adding "I have directed the officials to pursue the matter seriously and update me on the developments." Talking to reporters earlier, Bommai said, "It's an unfortunate incident. My government has taken it seriously. The perpetrators will be caught soon and brought to justice."

The Left party in an editorial in its mouthpiece People's Democracy also claimed that there have been incidents in which people from the community have been victims of violence over the last few weeks. The stray voices of some fundamentalist Muslim clerics, who have praised the Taliban, have become the pretext for the "likes of (Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi) Adityanath to raise the bogey of Talibanism in India", the CPI(M) said. "The everyday violence against Muslims is showing a disturbing pattern. In the month of August, there have been at least four recorded cases of gratuitous violence against Muslims in the streets of some cities and small towns in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.The targets of such attacks were poor Muslims such as street vendors, auto rickshaw drivers and even beggars," it said. The CPI(M) alleged that in all the attacks, videos were made and circulated. The purpose seems to be to publicise these acts of violence and glorify the "valour" of the attackers, it said. "Such casual violence directed against poor Muslims going about earning their livelihood are pathological symptoms of the fascistic activities of Hindutva outfits on the ground at a time when the leadership of the government in BJP- ruled states and at the Centre are becoming more "aggressive about implementing the Hindutva agenda," the party said. "The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan is being utilised by the BJP and the Hindutva forces as a golden opportunity to whip up feelings against Muslims and spread Islamophobia... If only the Hindutva zealots would look at the mirror and see themselves, they would find a mirror image of the Taliban," the CPI(M) said. The Taliban swept across Afghanistan this month, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities in the backdrop of withdrawal of the US forces that began on May 1. On August 15, the capital city Kabul also fell to the Taliban, even as a large number of Afghans attempted in vain to flee the war-torn nation.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-272

Justice NK Chandravanshi delivered the judgement on August 23 in a criminal revision plea filed by the man and his two family members, seeking to quash rape charge (against him) and other offences framed against them, their lawyer YC Sharma said on Thursday. As per the order, the victim married the man, a native of Changorabhata in Raipur, in 2017. After a few days of marriage, the woman's husband and her two in-laws allegedly started harassing her for dowry. The woman later lodged a complaint at the Bemetara police station of Bemetara district against the three. After investigation, a charge-sheet under section 498-A (dowry harassment), 377 (unnatural offences), 376 (rape), 34 (common intention) of the IPC was filed against them. After providing opportunity of hearing to counsels of both the parties, a trial court had framed charges against the applicants under these sections, the order said. The trio, including woman's husband, approached the High Court seeking to set aside the order of the trial court and discharge them from the charges, including that of rape against him. Counsel for the applicants submits that the complainant and the applicant No. 1 (man) are legally wedded wife and husband, therefore, none of the ingredients to constitute the offence punishable under Sections 376 and 377 of the IPC are spelt out against him, because, in India, marital rape is not recognized and the same is not an offence in view of Exception II of Section 375 of the IPC, the HC said. The counsel had prayed that the impugned order be set aside and the applicants be discharged from charges brought against them, it said. After hearing, the HC had reserved its order on August 13 and it was delivered on Monday (August 23). The order said, "Exception II of Section 375 of the IPC, referred to above, makes it clear that sexual intercourse or sexual act by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under eighteen years of age, is not rape." The judge said charge under IPC section 376 (rape) against the man was erroneous and illegal." "In this case, the complainant is legally wedded wife of applicant No. 1, therefore, sexual intercourse or any sexual act with her by the husband would not constitute an offence of rape, even if it was by force or against her wish. Therefore, charge under Section 376 of the IPC framed against the husband is erroneous and illegal. Hence, he is entitled to be discharged from the charge under Section 376 of the IPC ," it said. "In the instant case, the complainant has reported that the husband has many times, without her consent, made unnatural physical relation with her. Therefore, I do not find any infirmity or illegality committed by learned trial court in framing the charge under Section 377 of the IPC against the husband," the HC said. The HC said no illegality has been committed in framing other charges against the accused. "Consequently, the instant revision is partly allowed. The applicant No. 1 (husband) is discharged from the charge framed against him under Section 376 of the I.P.C. This Court finds that trial Court has not committed any illegality in framing the charge under Section 377 and 498-A/34 of the IPC against all the applicants", it added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-273
26-08-2021||India||Kerala records over 30k Covid cases for second consecutive day||The surge in COVID-19 infections in Kerala continued with the daily cases soaring past 30,000 for the second consecutive day on Thursday, even as opposition and public health experts attacked the state government's alleged "carelessness" and "unwise" decisions for the spike. Kerala today clocked 30,007 fresh cases, which is slightly lower than yesterday's 31,445 virus infection. Kerala Health Minister Veena George, who reviewed the state's COVID-19 situation two days ago, today blamed the violation of home quarantine directives for the worsening situation and cautioned against the increased indoor transmission of coronavirus at homes. Taking a serious note of the situation in Kerala, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla on Thursday reviewed the situation and the steps taken to contain the alarming graph of the virus in the southern state. "The home secretary reviewed the COVID-19 situation and the steps taken to contain the spread of the virus in the southern state and gave a number of suggestions," a home ministry official said. The meeting in which Bhalla took stock of the situation in Kerala also discussed issues related to containment strategy and medical infrastructure, the official added. Several top officials of the Centre and the state government attended the meeting, which was held through a video-conference Amid concerns of rise in cases in Kerala, the central government said the southern state is the only one reporting over 1 lakh active COVID-19 cases, while four states have 10,000 to 1 lakh active cases and 31 states have less than 10,000 active cases. It noted that 58.4 per cent of the total COVID-19 cases last week were reported from Kerala. The central government said the months of September and October will be crucial in pandemic management and cautioned that festivals should be celebrated in accordance with COVID-19-appropriate behaviour. Addressing a media briefing in New Delhi today, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan reiterated that the country is still in the midst of the second wave. Quoting a recent study by the health department, Kerala Health Minister said 35 per cent of people in the state were found to have been infected with the disease from home. The present situation is that when one person in the house gets infected, the disease is transmitted to other members also, she said in a statement and urged people to strictly abide by the directives of the government to keep the disease at bay. The minister said only those who have the required facilities at houses should prefer home quarantine and others should shift to domiciliary COVID-care centres (DCCs). George advised those placed under home quarantine not to step out of their room and asked all members of the house to wear masks to avoid risk of indoor transmission. She also released a set of directives to be followed by the people to fight the disease Her statement came hours after the Kerala government faced flak from its political opponents and public health experts for its alleged "carelessness" and "unwise" decisions regarding COVID-19 management, which according to them has led to the rise in cases and TPR in the southern state. The TPR, which was 19.03 per cent on Wednesday, also showed a slight dip today at 18.03 per cent. The last time it had crossed the 19 per cent mark was three months back on May 26 when it was 19.95 per cent. Attacking the state's ruling CPI(M)-led LDF government, Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Parliamentary Affairs V Muraleedharan attributed this to the "carelessness" of the Left government, which according to him was more focused on celebrating the anniversary of the Moplah riots rather than managing COVID-19. "Carelessness of the state government was the reason for this," he said and added that the Left government was "more focused on celebrating the anniversary of the Moplah riots". "That is not the priority. Dealing with COVID-19 should be the priority," he said while addressing the media in New Delhi. A similar view was expressed by senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala, who on Thursday told reporters that the state government has failed to prevent spread of COVID-19 in the state and demanded that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan apologise to the people. The senior MLA in the state Assembly also alleged that the "carelessness" of the state was the reason behind the rise in COVID-19 cases in Kerala. Talking to PTI, well-known public health expert Dr S S Lal blamed the absence of a clear-cut COVID management strategy, the keeping of the scientific community away from decision making and the "unwise" decisions taken at the bureaucratic level for the present fast spreading of the disease. Lal, who unsuccessfully contested in the recent Assembly election on a Congress ticket, also urged the CPI(M)-led government to release the health data related to the virus infection to evaluate the actual situation prevailing in the state. "The government is hiding all data related to the COVID-19. We are unable to analyse the actual COVID situation in the state due to the unavailability of the data. If we are able to access it, we can figure out the basic facts like which age group is most affected and so on," he said. In their briefing in New Delhi, ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said vaccines are disease modifying and not disease preventing so it is very important to continue the use of masks even after vaccination. Bhushan said, "We are still in the midst of the second surge of COVID-19 in our country. The second surge has not yet concluded. It is not over and therefore, we have to maintain all necessary precautions, particularly in light of our experience that after every festival we see a spike." "The coming months of September and October are crucial for us because we would be celebrating a few festivals. Thus festivals have to be celebrated with Covid-appropriate behaviour," he added. The government said 41 districts in India were reporting a COVID-19 weekly positivity rate of more than 10 per cent.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-273
26-08-2021||India||Farmers' convention focuses on expanding protest movement across India||The first day of an all-India convention of farmers that began at the Singhu border here on Thursday focussed on expanding the protest against three agriculture laws of the Centre all over the country. The two-day convention that marks the completion of nine months of the farmers' agitation against the three contentious laws was inaugurated by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait. "It is sad that even after nine months, the government is still not ready for talks (with the farmers). But we should not feel demotivated. During this convention, we will reflect on what we have lost and what we have gained over the last nine months," Tikait said. Delegates from 22 states representing 300 farmer and agricultural workers' unions and associations, 18 all-India trade unions, nine women's organisations and 17 student and youth organisations are participating in the convention. According to a statement issued by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), three sessions were organised on the first day of the convention -- one on the three farm laws, one dedicated to industrial workers and another pertaining to agricultural workers, the rural poor and tribal issues. "In all the three sessions, the speakers emphatically gave their suggestions for widening and expanding the movement involving farmers, workers, agricultural workers, adivasis and common people, thus widening the scope of the 'kisan andolan' so that it becomes a pan-India movement. "Ashish Mittal, convenor of the organising committee of the convention, placed the draft resolutions before the delegates, which called upon people to intensify and expand the ongoing struggle across the country so that the (Narendra) Modi government be forced to repeal the three anti-farm laws and give a legal guarantee on MSP," the statement said. Each session saw 15 speakers deliberating on a range of issues emphasising on the "deep transformations" that the farmers' movement has brought about and the "many positive outcomes" already being experienced due to the prolonged protest, it added. The convention also paid homage to the farmers who lost their lives while participating in the agitation. The event comes after nine months of persistent protests by farmers from across the country, who have been camping at Delhi's borders since November last year and agitating against the three farm laws that they claim will do away with the MSP system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations. Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws as major agriculture reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two sides.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-273

On March 13, 2019, all Boeing 737 Max planes were grounded in India by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) after the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max plane on March 10 near Addis Ababa which had left 157 people, including four Indians, dead. Aircraft manufacturer Boeing has been modifying the 737 Max plane since March 2019 so that various countries' regulators, including the DGCA, permit its passenger flight operations again. In its order dated August 26, 2021, the DGCA stated that the operation of Boeing 737 Max planes are permitted "only upon satisfaction of applicable requirements for return to service". A senior DGCA official confirmed that the ban on 737 Max planes' commercial flight operations has been lifted. Currently, only SpiceJet airline in India has Boeing 737 Max aircraft in its fleet. No other airline in India uses Max plane. On March 13, 2019, SpiceJet had to ground 12 Max planes, forcing it to cancel a significant number of flights on that day as well as on the next day. Jet Airways also had five Max planes in its fleet but they were already grounded as on March 13, 2019 due to non-payment of dues to the lessors. A month later, the full-service carrier had shut down its operations due to lack of funds. In March 2019 itself, several countries grounded 737 Max planes. The March 10, 2019 accident near Addis Ababa was the second in a period of five months. In October 2018, a 737 Max plane operated by Lion Air had crashed in Indonesia, killing 180 people.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-273

"Air taxis are being researched and invented globally and many startups are coming up," the minister said during a press conference here. "That time is not far when taxis, like the ones of Uber etc that you see on roads, you will see in the air under the drone policy. I believe this is very much possible," he added. The minister said that the Defence Ministry, the Home Ministry and BCAS (Bureau of Civil Aviation Security) have been working together so that "counter rogue drone technology" can be developed and adopted quickly. In a notification dated August 25, the Ministry of Civil Aviation eased the rules regarding drone operations in the country by reducing the number of forms that need to be filled to operate them from 25 to 5 and decreasing the types of fees charged from the operator from 72 to 4.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-273

ED, which has been investigating money laundering charges against the Chandras' and Unitech Ltd, said that both Sanjay and Ajay have rendered the entire judicial custody otiose as they have been freely communicating, instructing their officials and disposing of their properties from inside the jail. A bench of Justice D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah was told by Additional Solicitor General Madhavi Divan, appearing for the ED, that Chandras' have deputed their officials outside the jail to communicate their instructions to outside world. During one of our search and seizure operations, we have unearthed a secret underground office, which is being used by Ramesh Chandra and visited by his sons when they are out on parole or bail. "We have recovered hundreds of original sale deeds from that office, hundreds of digital signatures and several computers which contain sensitive data with regard to their properties in India and abroad, Divan told the bench. She said the probe agency has submitted two status reports in sealed cover to the court and have provisionally attached Unitech Ltd properties worth Rs 600 crore both in India and abroad. Divan pointed out that the agency has found a very intricate web of money trail through shell companies and the properties are being disposed of in real time, which is creating problem in the probe. They (Chandras') have been operating from inside the jail premises. They have rendered the entire judicial custody otiose. They are freely communicating and passing on instructions with the help of people deputed outside the jail premises. ED has found that they have even tried to influence a dummy director" when he was being interrogated by the agency, Divan said. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the Chandras, said that nothing is done against the jail manual. The top court said it is not hearing the Chandras at present and would first hear the ED's submission. On June 4, the top court had granted 15-day interim bail to Sanjay Chandra to attend the last rites of his father-in-law after which he had surrendered. On August 14 last year, the top court had dismissed the bail plea of Chandra, who was a month earlier granted interim bail for 30 days on "humanitarian grounds" as both his parents had tested positive for Covid-19, and asked him to surrender within three days. The apex court had also dismissed the bail application of Chandra's brother Ajay Chandra, who is in jail since August 2017. Both Sanjay and Ajay are accused of allegedly siphoning home buyers' money. The top court in its October 2017 order had asked them to deposit Rs 750 crore with the apex court registry by December 31, 2017. The Chandras have claimed that they complied with the court's conditions and they have deposited an amount in excess of Rs 750 crore and therefore they are granted regular bail. The top court had noted that since the October 2017 order, significant events have taken place and the apex court had directed a forensic audit to be conducted by Grant Thornton. It said that the court had earlier directed the Centre to ensure that all aspects, which were adverted to in the forensic report, should be investigated by the competent agencies, including with regard to the aspect of money laundering. The matter pertains to a criminal case which started initially by one complaint lodged in 2015 and later joined by 173 other home buyers of Unitech projects' -- 'Wild Flower Country' and 'Anthea Project' -- situated in Gurugram. On January 20 last year, in a respite to over 11,000 hassled home buyers of Unitech, the top court had allowed the Centre to take total management control of the realty firm and appoint a new board of nominee directors. The apex court had approved the name of retired Haryana cadre IAS officer Yudvir Singh Malik as chairman and managing director (CMD) of the new board and directed that the existing board of directors of the company would stand superseded. In 2018, the top court had directed a forensic audit of Unitech Ltd and its sister concerns and subsidiaries by Samir Paranjpe, Partner, Forensic and Investigation Services in Grant Thornton India. The forensic auditors had submitted their report which said that Unitech Ltd received around Rs 14,270 crore from 29,800 home buyers from 2006-2014 and around Rs 1,805 crore from six financial institutions for the construction of 74 projects.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-273

Addressing a press conference, the newly-appointed AICC election observer for Goa also expressed confidence that the Congress would form the next government in the state after the polls, but any decision on aligning with the like-minded parties would be taken at an appropriate time. "Congress party is getting battle-ready for the Goa Legislative Assembly election scheduled next year. Initial assessment is that the political atmosphere is extremely favourable for Congress in all the constituencies. There are indications that there will be change in government and the new government will be led by Congress party," he said. The people of Goa expect that there should be a change in the government and the Congress party will not disappoint them, he added. Chidambaram said the party will field such candidates, who are "loyal and faithful to the ideology of the party, hardworking and ready to serve the interest of the people of Goa". He also said that the party will find many aspirants in each constituency, but the decision about giving candidature will be taken only after consulting the active members of each block in the constituency, including those belonging to the Youth Congress, Mahila Congress, Seva Dal and other wings. When asked about the change in party leadership in the state and whether Goa Pradesh Congress Committee President Girish Chodankar would be replaced, the party veteran said, "I am not here to replace anyone. Such organisational matters are discussed and decided at the appropriate time." As per speculation, Chodankar is likely to be replaced with another senior leader in the run-up to the Assembly polls. Chidambaram also maintained silence on whether the party's chief ministerial candidate would be announced in advance. "The battle of Congress would be fought by 40 commanders in all the 40 constituencies," he said. He added that the candidates will not be announced "months in advance", but they would get enough time to campaign in their respective constituencies. The Congress had won the highest 17 seats in the 40-member House in the 2017 Goa Assembly elections, restricting the main opponent BJP to 13. But the saffron party moved swiftly to ally with regional parties and came to power under the leadership of senior leader Manohar Parrikar, now deceased. Over the years, Congress's strength in the Legislative Assembly dwindled to five after many of its MLAs switched sides and joined the ruling BJP.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-273
26-08-2021||India||India evacuates 35 people from Kabul ||India on Thursday evacuated 24 of its citizens and 11 Nepalese nationals in a military aircraft from Kabul in the backdrop of further deterioration in the security situation in the Afghan capital. People familiar with the evacuation mission said a plan was firmed up to bring back over 180 people but only 35 could be airlifted as the rest of them could not reach the Kabul airport to board the C-17 aircraft of the Indian Air Force in view of multiple check posts and other restrictions imposed by the Taliban in the city. "Op Devi Shakti in action! @IAF_MC flight with 24 Indian and 11 Nepalese evacuees from Kabul is on its way to Delhi. #DeviShakti," External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi tweeted in the morning. The people cited above said the security situation around the Kabul airport deteriorated further in the last couple of days due to which the Afghans and other people could not reach it. There has been a scramble by various countries to evacuate their citizens from Kabul before the August 31 deadline for the withdrawal of American troops from the war-ravaged country. American forces have been handling the security at the Hamid Karzai international airport in Kabul. Under its mission "Operation Devi Shakti", India has already evacuated over 800 people after Kabul was captured by the Taliban on August 15. Thousands of Afghans have been crowding around the Kabul airport for over a week, in a desperate attempt to flee the country fearing the Taliban's brutality. Several G-7 leaders requested US President Joe Biden to extend the August 31 deadline for the withdrawal of American troops. However, Biden said the US is trying to stick to the timetable. In the last few days, India has stepped up efforts to evacuate its citizens as well as its Afghan partners from Kabul in view of the deteriorating security situation in the Afghan capital and other parts of the country. On Tuesday, 78 people, including 25 Indian nationals and a number of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, were airlifted to Delhi from Dushanbe, a day after they were evacuated from Kabul to the Tajik city. India evacuated 392 people including two Afghan lawmakers in three different flights on Sunday. The Taliban seized control of Kabul on August 15. Within two days of the Taliban's capture of Kabul, India evacuated 200 people, including the Indian envoy and other staffers of its embassy in the Afghan capital. The first evacuation flight brought back over 40 people, mostly staffers at the Indian embassy on August 16. The second aircraft evacuated around 150 people including Indian diplomats, officials, security personnel and some stranded Indians from Kabul on August 17.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-273
26-08-2021||India||Amid concerns for imminent third wave, parents divided on Delhi schools reopening||Amid concerns of a possible third wave of Covid-19 in coming months, parents are divided over the plan to reopen schools in the national capital. An expert committee set up by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has recommended a phase-wise reopening of schools in the national capital beginning September. While few believe its high time the schools are reopened as the learning loss is huge, others feel there is no harm in waiting for few more weeks or a month as experts have been warning of a possible third wave. "The risk is not over yet. Reopening schools right before October-November during which the third wave has been predicted by experts, is not a wise decision. A system for online learning is already in place and extending it for few weeks or a month more will not cause any major harm when schools have been closed for so long already," said Aparajita Gautam, President, Delhi Parents' Association. Deeksha Verma, mother of a nine-year-old, said, "A flexible plan is a better option. If schools have to be reopened, they should not resume full time classes. There can be blended learning in beginning. We all know several countries are seeing resurgence in cases and we could be next". The All India Parents' Association (AIPA), however, has been demanding reopening of schools. "What is the justification in indefinitely delaying reopening of schools in Delhi? Like 2020-21, 2021-22 is also becoming zero academic year," AIPA President Ashok Agarwal said. Echoing his views, Nishant Bhardwaj, father of twins studying in class 8 said, "The government has already indicated that parental consent will be necessary for children to attend school and those who do not want will be able to attend online classes. What is the issue then? If some parents are not in favour, they can choose not to send their wards." Several school principals and education experts, however, are in favour of reopening schools. "School plays a requisite role in the holistic development of a child and it has been over 16 months since these institutions have been shut due to the Covid pandemic. The schools should reopen and physical classes should start in a graded manner keeping in mind the wellbeing of each and every stakeholder," said Anshu Mittal, Principal, MRG School, Rohini. "It's high time we should welcome students back to school to break the monotonous cycle of remote learning. This will help schools to traverse the learning gaps and students to cope with the learning outcomes," Mittal said. Anirudh Khaitan, Treasurer, FICCI ARISE, a collegium of stakeholders aimed at promoting quality education, said Covid-19 has had a dire impact on students across the country. "Apart from learning loss, they are suffering from a lack of social skills. There is also an increase in the impact on their academic skill set, mental health and emotional well-being too," he said. "However, there are critics who are concerned about the imminent third wave coming in and the reopening of schools. Therefore, to ensure utmost safety of the students, schools need to take bold decisions about reopening with strict protocols in place," he added. In its report submitted on Wednesday, the DDMA panel recommended that students from senior classes be called in the first phase followed by the middle-grade students and ultimately the primary classes. The committee has also said that willing parents should have the option of sending their child to school and others can opt for online classes. Schools in the national capital were ordered shut last year in March ahead of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus. While several states started partial reopening of schools in October last year, the Delhi government allowed physical classes only for grades 9-12 in January this year, which were again suspended following the exponential rise in Covid-19 cases during the aggressive second wave. Currently, students of classes 10, 11 and 12 can visit schools with the consent of parents for admission and board exam-related activities.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-273

Addressing a media briefing, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan reiterated that the country is still in the midst of the second wave. ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said vaccines are disease modifying and not disease preventing so it is very important to continue the use of masks even after vaccination. Bhushan said, "We are still in the midst of the second surge of Covid-19 in our country. The second surge has not yet concluded.

"The coming months of September and October are crucial for us because we would be celebrating a few festivals. Thus festivals have to be celebrated with Covid-appropriate behaviour," he added. The government said 41 districts in India were reporting a Covid-19 weekly positivity rate of more than 10 per cent. According to the government, 58.4 per cent of the total Covid-19 cases last week were reported from Kerala. "Kerala is the only state reporting over 1 lakh active Covid-19 cases, while four states have 10,000 to 1 lakh active cases and 31 states have less than 10,000 active cases," it said. Kerala alone on Wednesday recorded 31,445 fresh cases, which is 68.11 per cent of the national total of new infections in the last 24 hours. In this regard, the government faced flak from its political opponents and public health experts for its alleged "carelessness" and "foolish" decisions regarding Covid-19 management, which according to them has led to the rise in cases and TPR in the southern state which is presently accounting for nearly 70 per cent of the national total of daily infections. The government said over 400 evacuees were brought back from Afghanistan so far and that some of them have tested positive for Covid-19. The infected people have been isolated and are being treated. With 46,164 people testing positive for coronavirus infection in a day, India's total tally of Covid-19 cases has increased to 3,25,58,530, while the active cases rose to 3,33,725, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Thursday. The death toll climbed to 4,36,365 with 607 fresh fatalities, according to the data updated at 8 am. The active cases comprise 1.03 per cent of the total infections, while the national Covid-19 recovery rate was recorded at 97.63 per cent, the ministry said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-274

26-08-2021||India||Kerala government faces flak for 'foolish', 'careless' Covid-19 management||The Kerala government on Thursday faced flak from its political opponents and public health experts for its alleged "carelessness" and "foolish" decisions regarding COVID-19 management, which according to them has led to the rise in cases and TPR in the southern state which is presently accounting for nearly 70 per cent of the national total of daily infections. Kerala on Wednesday recorded 31,445 fresh cases, which is 68.11 per cent of the national total -- 46,164 -- of new infections in the last 24 hours. The TPR was 19.03 per cent on Wednesday. The last time it had crossed the 19 per cent mark was three months back on May 26 when it was 19.95 per cent. Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Parliamentary Affairs V Muraleedharan attributed this to the "carelessness" of the Kerala government, which according to him was more focused on celebrating the anniversary of the Moplah riots rather than managing COVID-19. "Carelessness of the state government was the reason for this," he said and added that the Left government was "more focused on celebrating the anniversary of the Moplah riots". "That is not the priority. Dealing with COVID-19 should be the priority," he said while addressing the media in New Delhi. A similar view was expressed by Congress MLA Ramesh Chennithala who on Thursday told the media that the state government has failed to prevent spread of COVID-19 in the state and demanded that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan apologise to the people. He also alleged that the "carelessness" of the state was the reason behind the rise in COVID-19 cases in Kerala. The senior Congress leader said that presently the state was accounting for around 70 per cent of the daily national total of fresh infections. Well-known public health expert Dr S S Lal blamed the absence of a clear-cut COVID management strategy, the keeping of the scientific community away from decision making and the "foolish" decisions taken at the bureaucratic level for the present fast spreading of the disease. Lal, who unsuccessfully contested in the recent Assembly election on a Congress ticket, also urged the Left government to release the health data related to the virus infection to evaluate the actual situation prevailing in the state. "The government is hiding all data related to the COVID-19. We are unable to analyse the actual COVID situation in the state due to the unavailability of the data. If we are able to access it, we can figure out the basic facts like which age group is most affected and so on," Lal told PTI. A similar accusation was levelled, on Wednesday, by Leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly V D Satheesan, who had alleged that the COVID control system in the state had failed and wanted the government to revive its existing strategies and methodology for disease management. "Though the total number of COVID patients has crossed the 38 lakh mark in the state, the government is still hiding the health data related to it. This will prevent evolving strategies to fight the third wave of the disease," he had said at a press meet here. The lack of data analysis has seriously affected even the research activities in the southern state, the leader had added. Speaking to PTI, Lal said that the state government has to increase the pace of vaccination to cover the maximum number of people possible and further expand the testing process to prepare people to fight the impending third wave of COVID-19. The state is witnessing a "high level of fast severe spreading" of the virus infection now-a-days and the high test positivity rate indicates this, he said. Though the death rate and severity of the disease is low due to vaccination, the disease is spreading fast in the southern state, Lal said. To fight the impending third wave, vaccination should be further increased and urgent steps should be taken to avoid crowds in public places and vehicles like state-run KSRTC buses, he added. He further said that the number of RT-PCR tests should be increased as the state still relies more on antigen. "We are missing several infected persons as we are not focusing on RT-PCR," the expert said, adding that the testing and vaccination should be expanded in private hospitals to reach out to the maximum number of people. Recently, some other public health experts, including Dr Amar Fettle, had said that relaxations during the festival season coupled with people not following COVID guidelines are behind Kerala's rising TPR and the state accounting for more than half of the country's virus caseload. "You cannot hold a gun to the people's head and make them follow the guidelines. They need to modify their behaviour on their own," Dr Fettle, the state nodal officer for COVID-19, said. The experts had predicted that the TPR would go beyond 20 per cent and the number of infections would rise further in the weeks after the Onam festivities. Since July 27, after the Bakrid celebrations when restrictions were relaxed for a few days, Kerala has been logging more than or close to 20,000 cases almost every day. The numbers rose to more than 24,000 on August 24 and then crossed 30,000 on August 25. Back in July, after the state government eased restrictions in the days running upto Bakrid, the Supreme Court had severely criticised the move and had called it "wholly uncalled for". It had warned that it will take action if the easing of curbs leads to further spread of the virus. Subsequently, close to the Onam festival, even as the state was recording close to or more than 20,000 cases almost daily, the Kerala government further eased restrictions on opening of shops, markets, banks, public and private offices, etc. It also said that instead of the two-day lockdown during the weekend, the restriction on movement will be applicable only on Sundays except on August 15 and August 22 when there will be no such bar. In an effort to reduce overcrowding, the government issued guidelines which said that people who have received at least one dose of vaccine or had a negative RT-PCR report not older than 72 hours or having a COVID-19 positive result more than a month old, would be allowed in shops, markets, banks, public and private offices, etc. However, as the cases and TPR rose post Onam, the state government responded by announcing that testing would be maximised in areas where vaccination rate was low. It also said that it aims to inoculate with the first dose as many people above 18 years of age as possible by the end of September.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-274

Birla is on a week-long trip to Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh as part of the 'parliamentary outreach programme for the empowerment of panchayati raj institutions'. Birla said he is visiting the region to strengthen the panchayati raj system and democratic institutions. Asked about recent political crisis in Afghanistan, Birla said India favours democratic system flourishing in all countries.

On the recent tensions on the LAC, Birla said, "India is capable of safeguarding its borders and people. And the country is against expansionism and cross-border terrorism." He further said border tensions arise due to the expansionist approach of few countries. Birla is scheduled to visit far-flung areas of Ladakh region including Pangaong Lake and Nubra Valley.

26-08-2021||India||Yogi makes slew of pro-farmer announcements ahead of UP polls||In an apparent bid to woo farmers ahead of the assembly polls early next year, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has made several pro-farmers announcements including withdrawing cases against them for stubble burning and launching a one-time settlement (OTS) scheme for interest waiver on their electricity dues. According to a senior official, the chief minister while interacting with a delegation of progressive farmers the previous day said, All the cases of stubble burning against the farmers will be withdrawn and decision will also be taken to revoke the fine imposed on them. The government will also ensure that because of power dues, no electricity connection of the farmers will be snapped and OTS scheme will be brought to waive interest on the power dues," he said. The chief minister also said cane price will be increased and a decision in this regard will be taken after talks with all the stakeholders. He said sugar mills of western region will start functioning from October 20 while mills of Eastern region will begin operation from October 25. The chief minister said dues of cane to the tune of Rs 1.42 lakh crore pending since 2010 were paid by the government and before the start of the next crushing season, all pending payments will be cleared. The state had done a record 56 lakh MT purchase of wheat from farmers on the minimum support price despite the adverse conditions due to the pandemic. For the last few years, the Supreme Court has been prodding the Centre and the state governments to stamp out stubble burning, especially in Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and western Uttar Pradesh, which aggravates air pollution in Delhi every year in October-November. The government move to revoke stubble burning cases is seen as an attempt to woo farmers to counter their agitation against the new farm laws. Farmers particularly from western Uttar Pradesh along with those from other states are on the warpath with the BJP-led government at the Centre over three agri legislations. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, which is spearheading the stir at the borders of Delhi, has declared that it will mobilise support against the saffron party in the upcoming state polls in Uttar Pradesh. The announcements made by the chief minister are being seen as part of efforts to pacify the agitating farmers, who are a key factor on many seats particularly in the western part of the state.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-274
26-08-2021||India||Yahoo shuts down news websites in India due to FDI rules||Yahoo has shut down its news websites in India due to the new foreign direct investment (FDI) rules that limit foreign ownership of media companies that operate and publish digital content in India. This includes Yahoo News, Yahoo Cricket, Finance, Entertainment and MAKERS India. This, however, will not affect users' Yahoo e-mail, and search experiences in India. "As of August 26th, 2021 Yahoo India will no longer be publishing content. Your Yahoo Account, Mail and Search experiences will not be affected in any way and will operate as usual. We thank you for your support and readership," a notice on the Yahoo website said. US tech major Verizon had acquired Yahoo in 2017. In the FAQ section, Yahoo said effective August 26, 2021, the company has ceased publication of content in India and has shut down Yahoo's content operations in the country. "We did not come to this decision lightly. However, Yahoo India has been impacted by changes to regulatory laws in India that now limit the foreign ownership of media companies that operate and publish digital content in India. Yahoo has had a long association with India and we're really proud of the premium, local content we have provided our users here for the last 20 years," it said. It added that given that Yahoo Cricket has a 'news' component, "it was impacted under the new FDI regulations that limit foreign ownership of media companies that operate and publish digital content in India in the 'News and Current Affairs' space". Thanking all its users in India for the "support and trust" over the past two decades, it noted that it remains "open to opportunities that connect us to users here". As per the new FDI regulations that will come into effect in October, digital media companies in India can accept up to 26 per cent investment in the form of foreign investment, subject to approval from the central government. "In case you are a Yahoo Mail user, this change does not affect you in any way. This development does not impact our products Yahoo Mail and Yahoo Search, where we will continue to serve users in India as before, without any change," it said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-274

The two-day event that will see participation from 1,500 delegates across organisations of farmers, women, youth, and labourers, is aimed at intensification and expansion of the ongoing movement against the Centre's farm laws. As part of the convention, three sessions will be organised on Thursday, including the inaugural session, and one each on industrial workers;agriculture labour, rural, poor and tribal people. Among the topics that the convention is expected to discuss are repeal of all three pro-corporate farm laws, legal guarantee for MSP of all crops, repeal of Electricity Bill, 2021, and no prosecution of farmers under the Commission of Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas Bill 2021. Farmers have been agitating at the Delhi borders demanding the repeal of the three laws since November last year. They have repeatedly expressed fear over the laws doing away with the minimum support price (MSP), leaving them at the mercy of big corporations. Over 10 rounds of talks with the government that has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties. It is sad that it's been nine months but the government is still not ready to talk. But we should not feel demotivated. During this convention we will reflect on what we have lost and what we have gained over the last nine months, said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait while addressing the protesters at the Singhu border.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-274

During the meeting, which lasted for about three and a half hours, Jaishankar said the government has adopted a "wait and watch" approach in dealing with the Taliban, depending on the evolving situation, and later told reporters in an answer to a similar question that let the situation settle down there. "Let the situation settle...You will have to keep patience on the question of our future policy," he said when asked about the government's approach towards the Taliban. Later in a tweet, Jaishankar said,"our immediate concern and task is evacuation and long term interest is the friendship for the Afghan people". Besides Jaishankar, Union minister and Leader of the House in Rajya Sabha Piyush Goyal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi were also present during the briefing on the latest situation in Afghanistan after the Taliban captured power there last week. Senior officials of the external affairs ministry, including Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla also participated in the meeting. As per the evacuation data shared among the participants at the meet, the government has evacuated --175 Embassy Personnel, 263 other Indian Nationals, 112 Afghan Nationals including Hindus and Sikhs, 15 third country nationals and the total figure stood at 565. The document further said the government also facilitated the evacuation of Indians by other agencies. NCP leader Sharad Pawar, Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, Leader of Congress party in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, DMK's T R Baalu, former prime minister H D Deve Gowda, Apna Dal's Anupriya Patel were among those who attended the meet. "We have a strong national position on Afghanistan. The friendship with the Afghan people is something which matters to all of us. So we (all parties) approached this situation very much in a spirit of national unity," he told reporters. Under Operation 'Devi Shakti', the government has undertaken six flights and brought back most of the Indians but not all of them, he said, noting that a few Indians are still there. "Some of them could not make the flight yesterday. But definitely we will try and bring everybody. We have also brought out some Afghan citizens who wanted to come to india at this point of time. We have tried to address many of the other issues by instituting an E-visa policy. So the overall sense was that the government is very very strongly committed to ensuring the full evacuation as soon as possible," he said. With the situation in Afghanistan fluid, he said there will be a lot of activity on this front but at the moment India's "focus is on evacuation and the government is doing every thing to ensure that we bring back our people". On the all-party meet, he tweeted "Briefed the floor leaders of all political parties today on Afghanistan and 37 leaders from 31 parties attended. Thank them all." He said India's strong friendship with the people of Afghanistan is reflected in the more than 500 projects it has there and that the friendship will continue to guide New Delhi. Jaishankar said India's footprint and activities naturally keep in mind the ongoing change. "We have undertaken evacuation operations in extremely difficult conditions especially at the airport. Our immediate concern and task is evacuation and long term interest is the friendship for the Afghan people," he said. Sources said Jaishankar apprised the floor leaders about the pre-emptive measures taken by India including the temporary withdrawal of Indian personnel from its consulates in Herat and Jalalabad in April last year, scaling down of the strength of the embassy in Kabul in June this year. Last year in February, Taliban leaders and the US inked a pact in Doha in February 2020 which envisaged religious freedom and democracy, with a government in Kabul that represented all sections of Afghan society after the withdrawal of American troops. Jaishankar also cited the evacuation of Indian staff from the Indian consulates in Kandahar on July 10-11 and from Mazar-e-Sharif on August 10-11, besides mentioning series of security advisories issued between June 29 and August 12, urging Indian nationals to leave the country immediately. The external affairs minister said India's priorities following the recent developments included the evacuation of Indian nationals, ensuring the safety of its diplomatic staff, extending assistance to Afghan nationals in distress and providing some leadership as part of the 'Neighbourhood-First' policy, the sources said. He said India's other priorities in view of the situation in Afghanistan included international coordination and humanitarian efforts. India's diplomacy and interests are recognised by other countries and the government is in touch with many partners, Jaishankar told reporters. The external affairs minister referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and said there will be many more communication in the coming days. He also referred to India chairing the UN Security Council special Session on Afghanistan and the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva. Referring to challenges faced while evacuating people from Kabul, Jaishankar cited frequent incidents of firing near the airport and inside Kabul, putting up multiple checkpoints by various groups and certain issues at the airport, sources said. Delays in landing permissions for aircraft, overflight clearances from relevant countries and coordination on the ground were some other challenges flagged by the external affairs minister, they said. Listing immediate measures, Jaishankar said a 24X7 special Afghanistan Cell was established in the Ministry of External Affairs to coordinate repatriation and other requests from that country in a streamlined manner, the sources said. According to sources, manned by more than 20 MEA officials, the Afghanistan evacuation cell has received 3,014 phone calls, responded to 7,826 Whatsapp messages and answered 3,101 Emails.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-274

26-08-2021||India||Fresh spell of rain expected in Delhi from August 29||A fresh spell of rain is expected in the national capital and adjoining areas in northwest India from August 29 as the monsoon trough is expected to shift towards the plains from the foothills of the Himalayas, according to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). Delhi and other areas in northwest India are currently witnessing a partial "break monsoon" phase, weather experts said. "The entire monsoon trough lies close to the foothills of the Himalayas. It is likely to remain there till tomorrow (August 26)," the IMD had said in a statement on Wednesday. R K Jenamani, a senior scientist at the IMD, said the region is experiencing a "weak monsoon" at present. "If the monsoon trough shifts close to the foothills of the Himalayas and remains there for two to three consecutive days, we call it a break monsoon phase," he said. During the monsoon season, there are spells when the trough shifts closer to the foothills of the Himalayas, leading to a sharp decline in rainfall over most parts of the country. This is called a "break monsoon" phase. However, rainfall increases along the foothills of the Himalayas, northeast India and parts of the southern peninsula. In July, the monsoon had entered the first break phase even before reaching most parts of northwest India, including Delhi. The national capital and adjoining areas in northwest India entered a "break monsoon" phase again on August 10 that continued up to August 19. The IMD said a cyclonic circulation is expected over northwest and adjoining the west-central Bay of Bengal on August 27. It is likely to pull down the western end of the monsoon trough from August 29, leading to rains in northwest India, including Delhi. Light rain is predicted in the capital, starting August 29. The city has gauged 214.5mm rainfall against the normal of 221.8 mm this month so far. Normally, Delhi records 247.7mm precipitation in August. Of the 214.5 mm rainfall this month, 138.8mm came in 24 hours ending 8:30 am on Saturday, which was the highest on a day in August in 14 years. The capital had gauged an unusual 507.1 mm rainfall this July, which was nearly 141 per cent above normal. It was also the maximum rainfall in the month since July 2003, and the second-highest ever. Owing to the intense bursts of rains in July, the capital has gauged 756.4 mm rainfall since June 1, when the monsoon season starts, against the normal of 497.9 mm -- 52 per cent more precipitation than normal.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-275
26-08-2021||India||Law while changing with social needs must recognise technological advancements, says Kerala HC||Law must not only change with changing social needs, it must recognise technological advancements, the Kerala High Court has said while referring to a larger bench the question -- whether a wedding under the Special Marriage Act (SMA) can be solemnised online via video conferencing. Justice P B Suresh Kumar said that the Supreme Court in National Textile Workers' Union vs. P R Ramakrishnan case had observed that "if the law fails to respond to the needs of changing society, then either it will stifle the growth of the society and choke its progress, or if the society is vigorous enough, it will cast away the law, which stands in the way of its growth." The high court said it was constrained to quote the apex court's observation as there were large number of cases before it involving situations where one or both the parties to an intended marriage had to leave the country, after giving notice of the wedding as required under the SMA, on account of inevitable social requirements and could not, consequently, solemnise the marriage. "Cases involving situations where parties to the marriage who have left India after giving notice of the intended marriage, could not come back to India due to reasons beyond their control and could not consequently solemnise the marriage, have also come to the notice of this court," Justice Kumar said. The high court said a "pragmatic interpretation" of the provisions of the SMA "would redress the grievances of many such people". It also termed as incorrect the views expressed by two other single judge benches of the high court that solemnisation of marriages under SMA via videoconferencing would dilute the provisions of the Act and that physical presence of both parties is mandatory. "The law must not only change with the changing social needs, it must also acknowledge and recognise technological advancements," it added. The high court also referred to the provisions of the Information Technology Act and said that proposal and acceptance made by parties to marriage through videoconferencing cannot be said to be invalid. "If it is valid and permissible, there is absolutely no reason why the parties to a marriage under the Act (SMA) shall not be permitted to solemnise the marriage by exchange of words through video conferencing," it said. The high court also said that the SMA does not prescribe the formal act to be performed by the parties for solemnisation of the marriage and the parties are given the freedom to choose the act. "In other words, the act to be performed for solemnizing the marriage need not be a physical act. The marriage can be solemnised by exchange of words as well," the high court said. Justice Kumar also said,"... if a witness in a criminal case can be permitted to depose before the court under oath through video conferencing, according to me, the parties to an intended marriage can certainly be permitted to solemnise the marriage by exchange of words through video conferencing. "The order came on the pleas by several petitioners who have contended that personal physical presence of the bride and groom is not necessary for solemnisation of nuptials under the law. The state government, on the other hand, is not in favour of online solemnisation of marriages under the Act. It has contended that solemnization of marriage was mandatory prior to registering it under the SMA and therefore, presence of the two sides and the witnesses is required before the Marriage Officer. It has further contended that another requirement for solemnisation of the marriage was that at least one of the two parties has to be a resident of the area within the territorial limits of the Marriage Officer for minimum 30 days prior to issuing the notice of the intended nuptials. Therefore, two persons living abroad cannot have their marriage solemnised online if they do not satisfy the residence requirement. The petitioners, represented by advocates A Ahzar, Jawahar Jose and V Ajith Narayanan have contended that when marriages under SMA can be registered online, therefore, solemnisation too does not need physical presence of the parties involved. They have claimed that there are various judgments which say that appearing via video conferencing is akin to being present in person with the sole difference that parties cannot be touched. They said that under SMA the marriage can be solemnised by any means, like exchange of garlands or shaking of hands, as long as both parties make the declaration that they take each other as the lawfully wedded husband and wife. They also said that signatures can be submitted via digital format and the same was recognised under the Information Technology Act.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-275
26-08-2021||India||Face of anti-Taliban resistance cut her teeth in activism at DU||A week ago when Gifty Sehrawat from Delhi University saw a video shot in Afghanistan, she gasped: “Oh my God! That’s my classmate!” On the screen was Crystal Bayat, who, at 24, has emerged as the face of the peaceful resistance to the new Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Bayat had cut her teeth in activism at Delhi University — a testimony to the vibrancy of Indian campuses that has fallen prey to vicious attacks after the Narendra Modi government came to power. A human rights activist, entrepreneur and aspiring diplomat, Bayat had studied political science at the DU-affiliated Daulat Ram College (DRC) between 2016 and 2019, during which she had taken part in multiple movements although the causes did not have a direct bearing on her. Bayat was filmed by The New York Times leading a march with the Afghan national flag on August 19, the country’s Independence Day. Taliban militants prevented their attempt to fly the flag atop a hill with threats, assault and finally gunfire that injured at least three people, she told The Telegraph on Wednesday. Currently at an undisclosed location outside Kabul, Bayat fondly remembered her time at DRC where friends encouraged her not to give up studies or her dreams even when the going got tough. She told this newspaper over an Internet call: “My teachers supported me. My friends Deeksha Gulia and Kalpana Rawat showed me a new face of life. They were most helpful and gave me the strength to stay on to complete my studies in India even when I faced difficulties…. My friends continue to ask about me now.” Bayat added: “I expect India to show friendship at this time of crisis. I don’t think they are helping very much right now. Refugees must be given good facilities and avenues for employment.” Bayat said she had opportunities to move to India, the United Arab Emirates or Turkey, but chose to stay back in her country for now. “I want to resist this violence. I want to show that we women will not give up so easily the rights that we fought for.” One of Bayat’s teachers at DRC, Deepak Bhaskar, said she often attended Delhi University Teachers’ Association protests to show solidarity, as well as agitations on campus. “I once saw her at a demonstration of students from the Northeast near the Vivekananda statue (on the DU campus). I asked what she was doing there, and she replied that she was standing with people fighting for a good cause. She chose her causes, and did not go to every protest,” Bhaskar said. He said some of the things Bayat had said stuck with him. “People can realise their goals when there is order in society. Human beings are not trained to be in chaos rather than order. Therefore, we need order, not chaos,” Bhaskar recalled Bayat as telling him as a student. Bayat had gifted Bhaskar a yellow hand-woven Afghan stole. DRC, a women’s college, attracts several Afghan students. The political science class has at least two students from that country every year. Bayat was on a scholarship from the Indian Council for Cultural Relations — the route of choice to India for most Afghan students. “She spoke little, but was vocal when something happened and would participate as well as organise, like she did during the protests against the sexual harassment of a student by a bank employee (in 2017). The political science department is a vibrant space and she is trying to practise what she learnt here,” Bhaskar said. After returning to Afghanistan in 2020, Bayat started a number of initiatives like the Justice and Equality Trend — a civil rights group — the Crystal Charity Foundation and a logistics firm. She also began studying to join diplomatic service and obtained a master’s degree from an Iranian university. “The last 19 years, I am studying to achieve my goals, but today unfortunately all my dreams have died,” Bayat told the Times, choking. Bayat’s faith in democracy was strengthened by early victories in her career as an activist. She was part of a movement for the recognition of the Bayat ethnic minority of Turkic Shias by the previous Afghan government last year. Seeing her gynaecologist mother and bureaucrat father unable to work after the Taliban takeover, Bayat organised friends and associates of the Justice and Equality Trend for a march to the Wazi Akbar Khan hill, which overlooks the capital Kabul, to hoist the national flag on August 19. “The Talib flag is illegal, so I asked many to come with me to hoist our national flag on Independence Day. My family was supportive but neighbours said it was wrong and unsafe for me to take a stand against terrorists…. When we were shouting ‘Zindabad Afghanistan’, the Talib opened fire. They argued with me, saying I was a woman and I should be indoors, and that we had just 20 days of freedom. They beat up the men with us,” she said. Bayat added: “I want to tell the world that ‘look, the Taliban haven’t changed. They don’t want us women in politics or the economy. They don’t allow the arts. They have declared music as haram. They will be resisted’.” Bayat’s classmate Sehrawat told this newspaper: “We have sat together in protest in college.… After things went bad in Afghanistan, I knew she wanted to leave as she also knew it was risky. But when I saw her in a video, I was shocked. I said, ‘Oh my God! That’s my classmate.’ We are proud of her.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-275
26-08-2021||India||DU to drop Mahasweta Devi's short story 'Draupadi'  from BA syllabus||The academic council of Delhi University has decided to drop Maheswata Devi’s short story Draupadi and the autobiographical works of two Dalit writers from the BA English Honours syllabus. A section of teachers has called the decision “arbitrary”. The oversight  committee head, M.K. Pandit, said parts of the syllabus were continuing for years and the changes were routine The academic council on Tuesday took up the recommendations of the oversight committee on syllabus change. Fifteen elected members of the council, which has 130 members, gave a dissent note against the move to drop Draupadi, which deals with the struggle of a tribal woman against oppression. The autobiographical works of Dalit Tamil writer Bama and Dalit Telugu writer Sukartharini were replaced by the works of Ramabai, a writer from a dominant caste. The decision of the academic council will have to be passed by the executive council. The authorities propose to implement the new syllabus from the current academic session. Biswajit Mohanty, a faculty member of Deshbandhu College and an elected academic member, said the decision to drop the works showed an anti-tribal, anti-Dalit and patriarchal mindset. Rudrashish Chakraborty, a faculty member of English from Kirori Mal College under DU, said the oversight committee was guilty of not only undermining the laid-down academic processes of the university, they had also abdicated their responsibility towards the students by delaying the notification of the syllabus in every semester. “It is unbecoming of a university having stature like DU to notify the syllabus five weeks after the commencement of the semester. The fact that students/teachers don’t know which texts to study/teach speaks volumes about the academic apathy and the irresponsibility of the Oversight Committee towards the teaching-learning process. Coupled with this is the overreach of the arbitrary addition/deletion of texts without the consent of the Committee of Courses -- the only statutory body to frame the syllabus," Chakraborty said. Pandit said that the committee had gone by academic merit and taken the decision.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-275
26-08-2021||India||PMO clears list of nine names for elevation as Supreme Court judges||The Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday evening cleared the names of all the nine judges recommended by the Supreme Court collegium for elevation as judges of the apex court. Sources said the government wanted some names to be reconsidered but Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana declined to concede the request. All the recommended names should be cleared, the CJI is learnt to have insisted, following which the PMO did so, the sources added. With Wednesday’s approval, the number of apex court judges has gone up to 33, including the CJI, against the sanctioned strength of 34. The recommendations made by the collegium were cleared within a week by the Narendra Modi government despite its constant friction with sections of the judiciary. The sources said the swift approval of all the recommended names was expected to help usher in a thaw between the executive and the judiciary. What is perceived to have been a key irritant had already been removed as the recommended names did not include that of Justice Akil Kureshi, one of the most senior high court chief justices. Justice Kureshi, now heading Tripura High Court, had sent Amit Shah, the current Union home minister, to CBI custody in 2010. This is the first time that the names of nine judges were recommended for elevation at one go by the collegium, now headed by CJI Ramana. The sources said the PMO, after approving the names, forwarded the list to the Union law ministry for its onward transit to the President for issuing the necessary warrant of appointment. The nine names cleared include those of three women judges.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-275
26-08-2021||India||Pegasus: Bengal government puts state-appointed probe on hold||The Bengal government on Wednesday suggested it would keep on hold a state-appointed commission’s probe into the Pegasus snooping allegations, heeding the Supreme Court’s call for “restraint” and advice to “wait” as it was already hearing the matter. Announced by chief minister Mamata Banerjee on July 26, the country’s first commission to probe the Pegasus controversy was scheduled to submit its findings and recommendations within six months. The panel is made up of former Supreme Court judge Justice Madan B. Lokur and former Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court Justice Jyotirmay Bhattacharya. During Wednesday’s hearing, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the Bengal government, assured the Supreme Court that the commission’s investigation would be kept in abeyance for now. The bench of Chief Justice N.V. Ramana and Justice Surya Kant had expressed its reservations about a parallel inquiry. The state, however, said the NGO Global Village Foundation Public Charitable Trust, which has approached the apex court seeking the cancellation of the commission, was associated with the RSS and that its petition was politically motivated and aimed at scuttling an independent inquiry. CJI Ramana told Singhvi that the bench was already hearing petitions seeking a court-monitored investigation into the Pegasus allegations and that it would tag the Bengal government’s plea against the NGO’s appeal with them. “If we are hearing other matters (related to Pegasus), we expect some restraint…. The present issue is connected to other issues (associated with Pegasus). In all fairness, we expect you to show restraint. You can wait. We will hear it with the other matters sometime next week,” Chief Justice Ramana told Singhvi. Singhvi initially said “heavens would not fall” if the committee was allowed to proceed with the inquiry. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for the NGO, contended: “You can’t have two parallel inquiries. Please see nothing is done in the proceedings there while the court is hearing the matter.” Justice Surya Kant agreed, saying if a parallel inquiry was allowed to proceed, it would have pan-India implications. “These matters are likely to have pan-India implications. We will have advantage of your (the Bengal government’s) assistance in those matters also,” the judge said. Singhvi urged the court not to pass any order or make observations. “Between now and next week, nothing earth shattering is happening. Your Lordship’s word will create a splash,” he submitted. CJI Ramana replied: “Mr Singhvi, you are not listening to us. All we were saying was we will list this with other matters. You’re forcing us to pass order.” The senior counsel said: “Please say nothing, I will convey it (to the Bengal government).” The comment implies that the committee’s probe will be kept on hold for now. The bench issued a formal notice to the Bengal government on the NGO’s petition and tagged it with the batch of pleas filed by journalists and civil liberties activists seeking a court-monitored SIT probe into the allegation that the Israeli spyware Pegasus had been used to snoop on judges, journalists, activists, politicians and others. ‘RSS link’ In a counter-affidavit on the NGO’s public interest litigation petition, the Bengal government linked it with the RSS. “It is submitted that the motive behind the filing of the instant Writ Petition is nebulous to say the least. The answering respondent believes that the Petitioner’s intent behind filing this writ petition is to divert this Hon’ble Court’s attention away from the seminal issues it is being confronted with in the main batch of writ petitions filed by reputed journalists, members of civil society and persons allegedly affected by the ‘Pegasus’ software, by drawing the State of West Bengal into the centre of the controversy,” the affidavit stated. “The said apprehension is neither remote nor unfounded. It is necessary to mention that the Trustee and Chairman of the Petitioner, one Mr Balram Nandwani, has close associations with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, an affiliate of the RSS,” the affidavit, filed through additional chief secretary B.P. Gopalika, alleged. According to the Mamata government, the intent behind the state’s decision to appoint a commission of inquiry was neither to have a parallel probe nor to overreach the proceedings pending before the apex court. “It cannot be disputed that the RSS and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch and the ruling party at the Centre, the BJP, are affiliates and have often vilified the State Government for political gains,” the Bengal government added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-275
26-08-2021||India||World Health Organisation revises blood pressure control guidelines ||New guidelines for blood pressure control released by the World Health Organisation on Wednesday recommend 130 as the upper number threshold for starting medicines for anyone with risk factors or a history of cardiovascular disease and 140/90 for others. The guidelines on when to start treatment, which medicines to use and the frequency of doctor-patient follow-ups also recommend that adults with high blood pressure should preferably start with a combination of two drugs instead of a single drug. The new guidelines deviate in subtle yet significant ways from the standard treatment protocol for hypertension released by India’s health ministry in February 2016. The protocol required people with blood pressure readings 130-139/80-89 to be advised a recheck after a year and sooner if they have other cardiovascular risk factors. The WHO’s hypertension  guidelines — the first from the organisation in 21 years — come amid concerns that over 1.4 billion people worldwide have high blood pressure but only 14 per cent have it under control despite available cost-effective treatment options. Several studies in India have suggested that a vast majority of people with high blood pressure either receive inappropriate therapy or fail to adhere to prescribed therapy and thus have poor control. One nationwide review had estimated that only a third of patients have successful control. “Through the guidelines, we want to maximise the number of patients who benefit from proven pharmacological treatment,” K. Srinath Reddy, a senior Indian cardiologist and chair of WHO’s hypertension guidelines development group, told The Telegraph. WHO recommends pharmacological treatment at any level of systolic blood pressure (the upper number) above a threshold of 130 for people who have existing cardiovascular disease, or are at high risk through diabetes or chronic kidney disease. “The upper number (130) alone may be used for the treatment decision,” Reddy said. For other individuals without such underlying risk factors, the new guidelines recommend treatment for confirmed blood pressure readings above 140/90, in line with India’s existing protocol. But while India’s protocol recommends treatment initiation with a single drug for patients with blood pressure readings lower than 180/110, WHO recommends a two-drug combination therapy for adults requiring pharmacological therapy for hypertension. The guidelines development group has said one major reason for poor blood pressure control is that most patients receive only monotherapy (single-drug treatment), while evidence suggests that most patients require two drugs to “achieve optimal and sustained control”. The rationale for combination therapy is also based on evidence that a combination of two drugs with complementary actions yields greater blood pressure reduction efficacy and that lower doses of each drug also reduces the potential side effects. “Combination therapy is preferable to achieve good results with less side effects compared to those from high doses of a single drug,” Reddy said. However, in patients who have not been adequately tested for other health parameters, a single drug is advised. The target of treatment should be to achieve an upper number less than 130 in high-risk patients and below 140/90 in others. The guidelines recommend a monthly follow-up after start of therapy until the target is achieved and a follow-up in three to six months for blood pressure under control. Some cardiologists in India have over the past three years argued for a reduction in the diagnostic thresholds for blood pressure from 140/90 to 130/80. However, others believe that while 130/80 is an ideal target, people with levels between 130-39/80-89 need not be prescribed drugs immediately, but first asked to reduce salt intake, lose weight and stop smoking.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-275
26-08-2021||India||Delay in IIT Bhubaneswar director appointment exposes opacity||The delay in the appointment of a director for IIT Bhubaneswar more than a year after the conduct of the interview has exposed the opacity associated with key appointments in elite educational institutions and rampant ad-hocism in their functioning. The education ministry had advertised the posts of directors for IIT Bhubaneswar, IIT Patna and IIT Ropar in November 2019. A panel headed by then education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal had conducted the interviews on July 14 last year through video-conferencing. The IIT council headed by the Union education minister appointed the director of IIT Ropar in January after approval by the President — the Visitor of central universities and the IITs. On Tuesday, the council appointed Prof T.N. Singh, a faculty member from IIT Bombay, as director of IIT Patna. But IIT Bhubaneswar’s wait continues for a regular director since April 25, 2020, when the incumbent Prof R.V. ended his five-year tenure. Rajakumar has been continuing as in-charge director for the last 16 months. “This kind of delay in appointment of directors in IITs has never happened in the past. Here, the case is even intriguing. The interviews were held together for the three IITs. One IIT waited for six months, another waited for 13 months and the third one is still waiting for its director. This process is completely opaque,” said a senior faculty of IIT Bombay. It usually takes one to two weeks for the recruitment after the interviews are held. The ministry is supposed to send the panel of selected candidates to the President for approval. According to an education ministry official, in the current NDA regime, the files are unofficially sent to the Prime Minister’s Office. After green signal from the PMO, the files are forwarded to the President. “If no suitable candidate was found, the process should have been cancelled and fresh advertisement should have come. But in this case, it is unclear as what the reasons are for the delay. Lack of transparency in appointment will discourage talented persons from applying for IIT directors,” the faculty member said. Apart from delay, ad-hocism has become a new normal in the functioning of these elite institutions. The absence of a regular director is affecting recruitment of faculty and planning of academic and developmental activities, an IIT Bhubaneswar faculty member said. The absence of a regular director helps the Centre to push its agenda, too. Last year, the education ministry asked each IIT to prepare a presentation on their research activities related to Covid, which Pokhriyal would tweet. The ministry unofficially wanted all faculty members in the respective IITs to retweet the minister’s tweet. The unofficial expectation was officially communicated by the IIT Bhubaneswar PRO to its staff and was withdrawn after sometime. “The MHRD (ministry of human resource development) wants maximum momentum to HRD minister’s tweets and has asked that from our institute end, all the deans, heads of schools including all the faculty members and all students to retweet the same tweet from their individual Twitter handles,” said the email from PRO Shalin Sasidharan Nair. In another email, the PRO stated that the matter was wrongly sent to all while he intended to discuss the issue with the dean of students’ affairs and the dean of faculty planning. This newspaper had sent an email to the education ministry to understand its perspectives on the delay and opacity associated with the appointment of IIT directors. No response could be obtained. In November 2020, the education ministry had cancelled the appointment process for the directors of IIT Mandi and IIT Indore after holding interviews on December 26, 2019.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-275
26-08-2021||India||Bihar lifts Covid curbs, reopens businesses, schools and colleges ||Bihar on Wednesday lifted most Covid restrictions, and announced the reopening of educational institutions and business establishments, as the state prepares for panchayat polls to be held over three months. Although Bihar has been reporting a negligible number of Covid cases of late, health experts expressed dismay at the government appearing to throw all caution to the wind at a time the highly infectious Delta variant has kept the country on tenterhooks and a third wave seems imminent. The 11-phase panchayat elections are to be held from September 24 to December 12. The schedule was announced on Tuesday. Elections will be held to 2.55 lakh posts in the three-tier panchayati raj system. There are 6.39 crore voters in the state. The polls were expected to be held in April but were postponed due to the pandemic. Covid cases had gone up exponentially in Bengal, Kerala and other states and fuelled the devastating second wave of the pandemic earlier this year after Assembly elections. The decision to lift most restrictions came after Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar chaired a meeting of the crisis management group consisting of several ministers and officials to review the Covid-19 situation. All business and educational institutions can now function normally. Social, political, cultural and sports events can be organised without any curbs. Religious places, closed since April 10, have also been allowed to reopen. “We reviewed the Covid situation. All shops, establishments, shopping malls, parks, gardens and religious places can now open in a normal manner due to improvement in the spread of the coronavirus infection,” Nitish tweeted after the meeting. “All kinds of social, political, entertainment, sports, cultural and religious events can be organised with necessary precautions and the permission of the district administration concerned. All universities, colleges, technical education institutions, schools and coaching centres can open in a normal manner and examinations can also be held,” Nitish added. However, cinemas, clubs, gyms, swimming pools, restaurants and other eateries will be able to operate with 50 per cent occupancy. “We the people of Bihar need to practise Covid-appropriate behaviour and precautions in the light of the expected third wave,” Nitish tweeted. Later in the day, chief secretary Tripurari Sharan issued detailed instructions on the lifting of restrictions. Bihar had imposed most of them in April, but was forced to go for complete lockdown on May 5 after the second wave of the pandemic wreaked havoc in the state. The government guidelines mention that only those who have taken at least one dose of Covid vaccine will be allowed to work in business establishments, restaurants and coaching centres, and avail themselves of the facilities at clubs, swimming pools and gyms. Only those inoculated with at least one dose will be permitted to enter government offices. The Bihar government will conduct rapid antigen tests on people coming from states that are reporting a large number of Covid cases or Delta variant cases. People with RT-PCR negative reports not older than 72 hours will not need to get tested while entering Bihar. Medical experts expressed shock at the removal of most restrictions. Indian Medical Association Bihar unit secretary Dr Sunil Kumar told The Telegraph: “Bihar is bhagwan bharose (at the mercy of God)…. Everybody knows that only the first lockdown that was imposed towards the end of March 2020 and continued till April-end was effective in the state. Thereafter none of the lockdowns were successful.” “We rarely see Covid-appropriate behaviour in the state. Enforcement is dismal. More precautions are needed at a time when the third wave of the pandemic is expected.” Men and women died like animals during the second wave here. There was no oxygen and beds in hospitals, people had to wait for hours in queues outside cremation grounds to perform the last rites of their relatives,” he added. IMA national president-elect Dr Sahajanand Singh, however, said unlocking was “needed to ensure that people do not die of hunger and the economy improves. Even otherwise, Covid cases across the country are low right now”.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-275
26-08-2021||India||Supreme Court keeps stated salary and agriculture out of creamy layer||The Supreme Court has held as sacrosanct a central government order of 1993 that stated salary and agriculture cannot be considered as part of gross income for determining the creamy layer. Lawyers and experts said Tuesday’s judgment would have significant bearing on a case pending in the apex court related to the consideration of salary income to decide who would fall under the creamy layer. The creamy layer is a term used to refer to those among the backward classes who are socially, economically and educationally advanced and are not eligible for reservation benefits. A division bench of Justices L. Nageswar Rao and Anuradha Bose on Tuesday struck down a 2016 Haryana government notification that stated that children of persons having a gross annual income less than Rs 3 lakh shall be the first to receive benefits of reservation in government jobs and education. Those with family incomes between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 6 lakh will be considered next, according to the Haryana government notification, while those with annual incomes above Rs 6 lakh will come under the creamy layer. This distinction on the basis of income led the Supreme Court to strike down the order. The state government had passed another order in 2018, including salary and all other incomes in gross annual earnings. Earlier in 1995, the Haryana government had issued a notification following central government criteria laid down in 1993, considering those holding constitutional posts and working as Class A employees as creamy layer. The Haryana notification of 1995 and the central order of 1993 had laid down that salary income and earnings from agriculture would not be considered while deciding the creamy layer, while stating that those with annual income over Rs 1 lakh would come under the creamy layer. However, in 2004, the central government’s department of personnel and training (DoPT) issued a clarification that said salary may be included in creamy layer considerations. Madras High Court and Delhi High Court ruled against this. The DoPT has challenged the Madras High Court judgment in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court’s ruling upholding the 1993 criteria, while hearing a petition from students, could have a bearing on the pending case. “The notification dated 17.08.2016 (of the Haryana government) is in flagrant violation of the directions issued by this Court in Indra Sawhney-I and is at variance with the memorandum dated 08.09.1993 issued by the Union of India,” the Supreme Court said. The court struck down the notification of August 2016 and held that the second notification of the Haryana government, issued in 2018, stood automatically nullified. Advocate Vikram Hegde said the court had considered the 1993 order of the central government to be sacrosanct. “The judgment in the Haryana creamy layer case paves the way to resolve many ongoing unnecessary litigations. This judgment clearly states that as per the 1993 order, income alone cannot be the criteria to adjudge creamy layer, if that income does not necessarily bring in social advancement. It’s only the business income which is the criteria to define creamy layer, while incomes from salary and agriculture are excluded for the purposes of creamy layer,” Hegde said. Advocate Shashank Ratnoo, an expert on OBC reservations, said Tuesday’s judgment further accentuated that the creamy layer concept was to exclude socially advanced persons and it was not based on poverty or income alone.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-275
26-08-2021||India||SC directs Delhi HC to dispose the Asthana plea in two weeks||The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed Delhi High Court to dispose of within two weeks a plea challenging the appointment of IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as the Delhi police commissioner. The non-profit Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) has argued in the Supreme Court that Asthana was given the new assignment just four days before his retirement in violation of previous apex court directives. The CPIL has sought quashing of the appointment. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana and Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and Surya Kant permitted the CPIL to move Delhi High Court to intervene in the pending plea against Asthana’s appointment. “We request Delhi High Court to consider the matter as early as possible in two weeks for us to have the benefit of the high court’s judgment. The petitioner (CPIL) is at liberty to file an intervention application (before Delhi High Court),” the Supreme Court said. Justice Ramana offered to recuse on the ground that he had been part of the high-powered committee that had examinedthe possibility of Asthana’s appointment as CBI director. However, advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the CPIL, said he had no objection to the CJI hearing the matter. Solicitor-general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that the high court should be allowed to deal with the issue since a similar petition seeking the quashing of Asthana’s appointment was pending before it. Bhushan, however, alleged foul play, pointing out that sometimes “ambush petitions” were filed, by simply resorting to “cut-paste”, in collusion with the government. “Today we find ambush petitions being filed, filed in collusion with the government to get a dismissal of the genuine petition,” Bhushan said. The top court then gave Bhushan the liberty to intervene in the petition pending in Delhi High Court or file a fresh one. Justice Chandrachud told Bhushan: “To obviate your apprehension, we can give you liberty to not just intervene but file an appeal. So you won’t have to depend on that petitioner (in the high court) as you may or may not trust them.” Mehta countered Bhushan, saying: “So far as ambush petitions are concerned, the less said the better. We have professional PIL litigants who file surrogate pleas at the behest of people who have lost out in the race.” Assailing Asthana’s appointment, Bhushan said: “It’s an egregious case. I’ve never seen a case where the government shows such brazen violation of the rule of law. He is given an extension in violation of each and every rule and just four days before retirement he is appointed a police chief.” The advocate added: “Every rule is thrown to the vents just to accommodate him.” Asthana was appointed Delhi police commissioner on July 27, four days ahead of his retirement on July 31, and was given a year’s extension. The Supreme Court had earlier ruled that no officer who has less than six months’ service left will be appointed as a director-general of police (DGP). The commissioner of Delhi police, which report to the Union home ministry, has a rank equivalent to that of DGP. Asthana’s cadre was changed from Gujarat to AGMUT (Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram, Union Territories), from which Delhi police commissioners are usually selected. Advocate M.L. Sharma had filed another petition in the Supreme Court seeking the cancellation of Asthana’s appointment and contempt proceedings against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who headed the appointments committee of the cabinet that recommended the officer’s selection, and Union home minister Amit Shah. The CPIL has also sought a direction to the Centre to initiate fresh steps for appointing a new police commissioner for Delhi, strictly in accordance with the directions of the apex court in the Prakash Singh case (2006) under which no officer who has less than six months of service left can be appointed to a DGP-rank post. The CPIL argued that the July 27 orders of the central government and the appointments committee were illegal on the following grounds: ⚫ Violation of the directions issued by the apex court in the Prakash Singh case. ⚫ Violation of Fundamental Rule 56(d), which stipulates that “no government servant shall be granted extension in service beyond the age of retirement of sixty years”. ⚫ The Centre does not have the power under Rule 3 of the All India Services (Conditions of Service — Residuary Matters) Rules, 1960, to relax Rule 16(1) of the All India Services (Death-Cum-Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958, in order to give extension of service to Asthana. ⚫ Violation of the policy regarding inter-cadre deputation of all-India service officers as prescribed under the department of personnel and training’s office memorandum dated November 8, 2004. ⚫ No UPSC panel was formed for the appointment of the Delhi police commissioner, and the criterion of having a minimum tenure of two years had been ignored. Bhushan pointed out that the high-powered committee of the Chief Justice of India, Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition had in a meeting on May 24 rejected the central government’s attempt to appoint Asthana as CBI director on the ground that he did not have six months of service left.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-276
26-08-2021||India||Muzaffarnagar riots: Adityanath government withdraws 77 cases ||As many as 77 cases related to the Muzaffarnagar riots have been withdrawn by the Yogi Adityanath government, the Supreme Court was informed on Wednesday. The figure emerged during a hearing into a petition seeking the setting up of special courts to try criminal cases against current and former lawmakers. As many as 510 cases relating to the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, in which over 50 people were killed and 50,000 affected, had been registered in five districts of the Meerut zone against 6,869 people. Of these, chargesheets have been filed in 175 cases, final reports have been submitted in 165 cases and 170 cases have been expunged. Around 77 cases have been withdrawn by the Uttar Pradesh government under CrPC Section 321, according to a report filed by senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, who has been appointed amicus curiae. Sources in Lucknow said many of the 77 cases were lodged against politicians and their associates. Earlier, the names of at least two Uttar Pradesh ministers and an MLA figured among those who stand to benefit from the withdrawals. “The government orders do not give any reason for withdrawal of the cases under Section 321 of CrPC. It merely states that the administration, after full consideration, has taken the decision to withdraw the particular cases. Many of such cases relate to offence of dacoity under Section 397 IPC, punishable with imprisonment for life,” the report said. The figures are based on information provided by the standing counsel of the Uttar Pradesh government to the amicus curiae. Section 321 of the CrPC enables the public prosecutor or the assistant public prosecutor to withdraw the prosecution of any person. The Supreme Court bench clarified that the court’s earlier observation that governments cannot withdraw criminal cases against the lawmakers did not mean that there was a blanket ban on such an option. The court said withdrawal was permissible, provided it was approved by the high court concerned. “We aren’t against withdrawal of cases but it must be examined. If the high court (concerned) is satisfied, they can allow the government to withdraw,” Chief Justice N.V. Ramana said during the hearing. The Enforcement Directorate informed the court that trials relating to 51 MPs and former parliamentarians accused in money-laundering cases involving over Rs 485 crore were pending adjudication for periods between two and 10 years. The ED report also said that 71 MLAs and former lawmakers were currently accused in cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. Of these, 48 cases are still being investigated. In a separate status report, the CBI stated that out of the 151 criminal cases pending trial before the agency’s special courts, 58 involved charges punishable with life imprisonment. The oldest of these 58 cases dates back to 2012. In 45 cases, charges have not been framed although the offences are alleged to have been committed several years ago, the CBI said. “Don’t keep things hanging like this. Do something. If a case has to be closed, then take a decision and if a case has to be continued, please do that,” Chief Justice Ramana told solicitor-general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre. The bench also has Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and Surya Kant. The PIL has been filed by advocate Ashwini Upadhyaya. Justice Chandrachud clarified that the orders being passed by the bench for expediting the criminal cases against politicians does not mean that their cases should be heard out of turn. “High courts shouldn’t treat our order as a mandate that cases of MPs and MLAs have to be heard out of turn,” Justice Chandrachud said. The bench made the observation after advocate Kamini Jaiswal complained that some current and former MPs facing criminal cases were asking for out-of-turn hearing of their appeals against their conviction.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-276
26-08-2021||India||Amarinder Singh to lead Congress in Punjab Assembly elections ||Amarinder Singh will lead the Congress in the Punjab Assembly elections, the party said on Wednesday, a day after several MLAs had demanded his replacement. “We will fight the elections in 2022 under the leadership of Amarinder Singh,” said Harish Rawat, the AICC general secretary in charge of the state. This came as a jolt to the dissident group — seven of whom had driven to Dehradun to meet Rawat — but the central leadership’s hand appears to have been strengthened by the clamour inside and outside the party against the allegedly “pro-Pakistan” remarks made by Malwinder Mali and Pyarelal Garg, who are advisers to state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. Given the speed with which the BJP latched on to Mali’s and Garg’s remarks, Sidhu’s failure to publicly reprimand them has upset many in the Congress who see this as gifting the Opposition a stick to beat the party with. Rawat’s statement came ahead of his meeting with the dissident group representatives. After the three-hour meeting with four Punjab ministers and three MLAs, the general secretary said they were not against anyone and were only concerned about the party’s election prospects. “They want to go to the polls with a clear road map so that we can win,” he said. Possibly reassured that seven of the 20-plus MLAs who had held a meeting on Tuesday in the presence of Sidhu later distanced themselves from claims of a revolt and a couple of others backtracked on Wednesday, Rawat further said: “There’s no threat to the party or government. There’s no threat to chances of our victory either.’’ At the same time, Rawat admitted that a section in the Punjab Congress had serious concerns about the functioning of the state government. Known detractors of Amarinder, some of the rebel leaders fear the district administration might work against them during the elections, sources said. This is their case for pushing for a leadership change. The next stop of the dissident group of seven could be Delhi, to attempt to meet the party high command. Rawat is also expected to come to Delhi. On Wednesday, PTI quoted Rawat as saying: “Navjot Singh Sidhu comes from a different background. We made him the Punjab Congress president with an eye on the future. But that doesn’t mean the entire party has been left to him.” “Sidhu ji is there, Amarinder Singh is there, Rajinder Singh Bajwa is there, Sukhjindher Randhava is there and, above all, a stalwart like Ambika Soni is there. They will all be taken into confidence to resolve the issue,” he added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-276

The incident occurred at Chaksinghar village under Jurawanpur police station located in the Raghopur diara (riverine) area. Incidentally, Raghopur is the legislative Assembly constituency of RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. “Altogether three persons have died in the incident while four others are undergoing medical treatment in the hooch tragedy,” Hajipur sub-divisional officer (SDO) Arun Kumar told The Telegraph. The deceased have been identified as Jitendra Ram, Ramji Ram and Uday Ram — all belonging to the Dalit community. The toll could go up, as the condition of those admitted to hospital was critical. Villagers said that around 10 people organised a fish and liquor party at the premises of a government primary school at Chaksingar on Tuesday night. The condition of several of those who participated in it deteriorated in a couple of hours with complains of vomiting, diarrhoea disorientation, and vision loss. Three of them succumbed on Wednesday morning. Angry over the incident, the people of the area shouted slogans against the government and the local administration. They alleged that illicit liquor trade was thriving under the patronage of the police. “We lost three of our people. They had consumed liquor and died after vomiting a few times. Everybody here knows that liquor is sold all around and police turn a blind eye to it,” villager Lalita Devi said. Hajipur Sadar SDPO Raghav Dayal told this newspaper: “Nobody has been arrested so far.” Around 16 people had died while four others had lost their vision after consuming illicit liquor in West Champaran district in July. At least 38 people have lost their lives in hooch tragedies in Kaimur, Nawada, Muzaffarpur and West Champaran districts this year. There have been a series of such incidents since Nitish imposed prohibition in the state, claiming that it will help cut down on crime, road accidents, and domestic violence, and at the same time will boost expenditure on health, food, clothes, education and lifestyle accessories. However, majority of the people believe that none of the objectives of the liquor ban were achieved. Sources in the government assert that lacklustre policing and a nexus between liquor mafia and law enforcement agencies have been the main reasons behind the failure of prohibition in Bihar. Senior police officers have confided that the focus of the police has shifted to liquor ban instead of controlling crime, due to which law and order situation in the state has deteriorated sharply. Notwithstanding raids and seizure of illicit liquor in raids by the police and excise department, the mafia has opened supply lines from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bengal and Nepal. It has also established a liquor distribution network for the people. Nitish had expected to gain politically from prohibition, especially the votes of women. But the jury is still out on the issue as he just managed to scrape through and retain the chief minister’s post in the 2020 Assembly elections. Economically, the state has been losing over Rs 5,000 crore annual revenue it used to get from the sale of liquor during the pre-prohibition era. It has also led to a loss of a large number of small jobs and businesses that thrived around liquor shops, bars and restaurants.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-276
26-08-2021||India||Elderly  man jumps into wife’s pyre, dies in Odisha’s Kalahandi district||An elderly man in Odisha’s Kalahandi district died by suicide by jumping into the funeral pyre of his wife. The incident took place on Tuesday night at Sialajodi under Golamunda block of the tribal-dominated district, about 490km from here. Police have registered a case of unnatural death on Wednesday. Sources said that Nilamani Sabar, a 68-year-old farmer, could not bear the loss of his wife, Raibati, 62, who died on Tuesday after having fever for a few days. Unable to come to terms with this personal tragedy Nilamani, jumped into the funeral pyre of Raibati even before those present could realise what was happening. The couple had four sons and a daughter, all married. While their three sons lived in the same village, the fourth son was settled in the neighbouring village. But Nilamani and Raibati lived in a separate house and earned their livelihood independently. While Raibati worked as a ward member of Sialajodi village, Nilamani grew crops on his land and also dabbled in astrology. Local Chahaka gram panchayat sarpanch Danara Bag told The Telegraph: “Raibati was suffering from fever for two days. Later, she was admitted to the hospital. After she recovered she came back home but suddenly her health deteriorated on Tuesday and she died.” “The cremation rituals began around 8pm. As per the rituals, after the pyre was lit all those taking part in the cremation went to the village pond for a bath leaving the body under the care of just one of the relatives to collect the bones. Nilamani, who was sitting all alone in a corner on the cremation ground, suddenly got up, ran and jumped into the burning pyre,” said Bag. The sarpanch said: “The couple used to get an old age allowance of Rs 500 each. They were also getting 10kg of rice under subsidised rice schemes. Besides, they used to sell chicken and goats. They never depended on their children. But Nilamani was distraught after his wife’s death and was also worried about his future. He might not have wanted to depend on his children.” Some local journalists visited the cremation site and confirmed the incident. “None of the sons of the couple are ready to comment on the issue. They have switched off their phones. Police today visited the site and registered a case,” said Sudhir Sahu. Dr Seema Parija, assistant professor, department of psychiatry, SCB Medical College and Hospital Cuttack, told The Telegraph: “Nuclear family structure has destroyed the social support system which existed for the elderly. Often the elderly land up in old age homes or are victims of abuse and neglect in their homes. When a spouse dies, the living partner often feels helpless and considers life a burden. Loneliness and isolation often lead to depression, anxiety and stress and may at times lead to suicide which they perceive as their only way of escape from misery.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-276
26-08-2021||West Bengal||Elocutionist Gouri Ghosh dies at 83||Eminent Bengali elocutionist Gouri Ghosh died on Thursday at a private hospital in the city due to severe neurological problem after suffering a brain stroke, family sources said. She was 83. Ghosh, wife of another critically acclaimed elocutionist Partha Ghosh, died at 9 am after being in ventilation for several days since her admission to the hospital on August 1, they said. She is survived by her husband and son Ayan Ghosh. Ayan told reporters his mother suffered a brain stroke in March but recovered well after being treated at a hospital and returned home. However she had convulsions on August 1 and got admitted to hospital again. Condoling Ghosh's demise, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said: her unique recitals will always be remembered by the countless listeners, poetry enthusiasts." Banerjee recalled the long stints of Gouri Ghosh with All India Radio Kolkata as announcer-presenter of programmes, her recitals aired and the bestowing of Kaji Sabyasachi Samman on her by the West Bengal government in 2018. Another popular elocutionist Bratati Bandyopadhyay said "she was like my mother. I recall how she had repeatedly cautioned me about maintaining safety protocols when COVID-19 first struck. We used to talk over the phone regularly." She added Ghosh's pronunciation of words and the way she expressed the spirit of a poem was motivational for elocutionists of next generations. Gouri Ghosh's recital of Tagore's timeless Karna Kunti Sangbad with husband Partha Ghosh had been one of the hugely popular albums of the couple for over a decade.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-119
26-08-2021||West Bengal||CBI registers nine cases related to post-poll violence in Bengal||The CBI has registered nine cases related to post-poll violence in Bengal, sources said on Thursday. All the four special units of the investigating agency tasked to probe the cases of violence have moved their units from Calcutta to crime scenes across the state, they said. More cases are under the process of registration with some of them being handed over by the state government, sources said. The CBI has taken over the cases on the instruction of a five-judge bench of the Calcutta High Court that had entrusted the agency with the task of investigating the alleged murder and rape incidents reported during post-poll violence in West Bengal. The High Court directives came after a committee of the National Human Rights Commission submitted a report on the violence in the state after Assembly poll results on May 2. The Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress achieved an astounding victory humbling the BJP in a bitterly fought eight-phase electoral battle. Passing a unanimous judgement on a batch of PILs seeking an independent probe, the High Court Bench also ordered the constitution of an SIT of state police officers to probe all other cases. The SIT will include Suman Bala Sahoo, Soumen Mitra and Ranveer Kumar, all IPS officers of the West Bengal cadre. The bench will monitor the investigations by both the CBI and the SIT and asked the two agencies to submit status reports to the court within six weeks. The bench said there are allegations that the complainants are being threatened to withdraw the cases and a number of cases of murder being claimed as natural death without recording FIRs and conducting probes according to the procedure established by law. Noting that the West Bengal police have not properly responded to the allegations of inaction and tried to downplay them, the bench said, "It certainly needs investigation by an independent agency." It said three months have lapsed since the matter was taken up by the court, but "no concrete action has been taken by the state, which could inspire confidence except filing affidavits and placing on record thousands of papers." A couple of days after Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamul Congress had emerged winner for the third consecutive time, the BJP and other parties, including the CPM and the Congress, complained of their workers being attacked and properties destroyed at various places in the state. When the case came up for hearing before a larger bench of the high court, the state government had argued that the incidents of violence had taken place between May 2 and 5 when the administration was under the control of the Election Commission. It further argued that after Mamata had taken over as chief minister on May 5, things were brought under control. The petitioners, however, continued to claim that post-poll clashes were still on and thousands of workers of Opposition parties had been rendered homeless and properties looted. Following the prayer, the five-judge bench ordered the NHRC to constitute a committee and probe into the cases of violence. Accordingly, an eight-member committee was formed and it filed its report before the court on July 13.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-119
26-08-2021||West Bengal||BJP attacks state govt on contractual teachers consuming poison ||Bengal BJP on Wednesday went to town against the Mamata Banerjee government over five contractual teachers consuming poison in front of Bikash Bhavan in Bidhannagar on Tuesday to protest their transfer orders. While two of these teachers are being treated at the NRS Medical College and Hospital, three are in RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. All the five are in critical care and intensive care units of the respective hospitals. BJP state general-secretary Sayantan Basu led local leaders to the NRS. Later, Union minister of state for education Subhas Sarkar also went there. “Education minister Bratya Basu must take care of his department… Nowhere under the BJP did teachers have to consume poison for their rights,” he said, demanding the minister’s resignation. He said since the teachers were in CCU, he couldn’t meet them, but said he was satisfied at the treatment the teachers were receiving in the hospital. Sarkar later claimed police prevented him from meeting the patients. “The police blocked the road... I’m a Union minister of state, I have a hospital of my own and know the protocols one must follow to enter the CCU, yet I was stopped,” he said. State Congress chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury in a social media post said: “... The incident of teachers trying to commit suicide... has shamed Bengal before the nation. I demand your (Mamata’s) direct intervention...” CPM’s Sujan Chakraborty and Citu’s Anadi Sahu visited NRS on Wednesday and spoke to doctors and police there. Bratya on social media dubbed the protesters as “BJP cadres”. He said the Mamata government had hiked the stipend of these teachers and brought them under the Swasthya Sathi health scheme. He added that a one-time pension of Rs 3 lakh had been started for those who have decided to retire at the age of 60. “Yet, those who are still protesting aren’t teachers. They are BJP cadres,” posted the state education minister.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-119
26-08-2021||West Bengal||‘Sand smuggler’ arrested in West Burdwan||The enforcement branch (EB) of the Asansol-Durgapur police commissionerate on Tuesday night arrested Sujoy Pal, a businessman with alleged links to sand smuggling in West Burdwan. Police seized over two dozen trucks with sand illegally mined from the Ajay and the Damodar rivers, from various locations across the district. Sources said the move came in the wake of a directive by the additional director-general of police (law and order) last week, asking all district police chiefs and commissioners to carry out daily raids against illegal mining, storage and transport of sand, stone chips and coal. The directive also asked the police to submit daily reports, with case details and action-taken reports to Nabanna and the DGP. Raids to catch sand smugglers are also on in Birbhum, Bankura, Hooghly and East Burdwan. “We are conducting raids to take on the illegal sand business,” said Nagendra Nath Tripathi, Birbhum police chief. As excavation of sand is halted for the monsoons till mid-October, district-magistrates in sand-rich areas have been asked to draw up a list of genuine leaseholders. “Besides police records, a daily report will be kept with the district as well, stating how much stockpiled sand was legally sold, so we can identify illegal sand stockpiled by smugglers,” said a senior police official in Birbhum. Birbhum police are also commissioning drones to keep a vigil on embankments more prone to such illegal activities. “We have registered two specific cases of sand smuggling and have arrested three persons from Goghat and Arambagh over the past few days,” said Amandeep, the police chief of Hooghly (rural). Police sources said Pal, in West Burdwan, was forcing sand-dealers to purchase coupons against a payment of Rs 4,000, in addition to Rs 3,000 per truck for ensuring the smooth transportation of illegally-mined sand. “Acting on a tip-off, we have arrested Sujay Pal from the New Township police station area in Durgapur on Tuesday night. Several cases of sand smuggling were lodged against him at Kanksa and Andal police stations. We will seek his custody for further interrogation,” said an EB official. Pal was produced before the additional chief judicial magistrate’s court in Durgapur on Wednesday. He denied all allegations. “I am a businessman and have no such links. I stand falsely accused,” he said. The BJP and the CPM had accused the ruling party of patronising illegal sand smuggling. Ruling Trinamul, however, said the chief minister had taken a strong stand against sand and coal smuggling. The Bengal government has recently changed its policy, approved by the cabinet, for sand mining, and has decided to install a centralised system for the auction of sand quarries, after allegations emerged that local political leaders were controlling the auction system and hurting the state’s financial interests. According to the new system, the auction of sand quarries will be done by the West Bengal Mineral Development and Trading Corporation, under the industry department, instead of district magistrates. The CBI has been carrying on separate probes into coal smuggling in the region since November last year.

26-08-2021||West Bengal||Alarm over Covid curb flout in Digha hotels ||District authorities in East Midnapore’s Digha are reportedly set to resume raids on hotels in the wake of reports that Covid-19 safety protocols were being flouted by some in exchange for inflated room tariff. Following partial ease on statewide Covid curbs from August 16, Digha this weekend recorded over 25,000 tourists, well over the average weekend footfall in a regular year. However, sources said that many tourists were neither fully vaccinated nor carried with them a negative Covid test, but were still being allowed into a few hotels in violation of rules by brokers. “Brokers have always been there in Digha. Now, they have turned their trade into a seedy one where they are leading unvaccinated guests into hotel rooms,” said a district official. In mid-July, a strict Covid protocol was started when the Contai SDO issued an order mandating outstation residents entering Digha to show proof of full vaccination (both doses) or a negative test report. Strict police vigilance, including raids on hotels, followed, but the trend is petering out in the last couple of weeks, said sources. “We heard some brokers are flouting norms again, so we will resume raids and fine hotels accordingly,” said Ramnagar-I BDO Bishnupada Ray. On Tuesday, managers of three hotels were arrested in this connection. “We estimate at least half of the tourists this weekend violated norms. But we will not allow this to happen again,” said a New Digha hotelier. “We think some hoteliers caved in to the sheer financial duress from the past year (to violate Covid rules),” he added. Bipradas Chakraborty, joint secretary of the local hoteliers' association, concurred. “There is a certain kind of hotel owner who we suspect does this, but by and large, most reputed Digha hotel owners won’t,” he said, adding the spectre of a possible third wave was “on everyone's mind”. “The financial toll on our industry has been immense. But we cannot cut corners on public health,” he added. Police sources said on Wednesday that guests from Calcutta and suburbs could also have driven in on nights this past weekend, hoping to evade strict police checkpoints that had made the news until late last month.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-119

BSF officers said the market value of the seized ornaments was around Rs 23.06 lakh. The BSF team, attached to 112 Battalion, nabbed the tricycle-van peddler allegedly carrying the silver inside the frame of its wooden carrier. The accused, Suban Dalal, 31,  is from Hakimpur-Uttarpara village of Swarupnagar. He handed over to Customs authorities along with the seized ornaments for further legal action. A BSF spokesperson from the South Bengal Frontier said that the team had been acting on a tip-off by its intelligence wing and had intercepted the tricycle van as it was approaching the border fencing in Bithari village around dawn on Wednesday. Narayan Chand, commanding officer of 112 Battalion, said: “Our personnel became suspicious after observing the movement of the tricycle van. They halted it and began checking the van when they noticed a hollow channel inside the frame of the wooden carrier. They unscrewed it and found the silver ornaments, which were hidden in 47 packets and wrapped in brown paper." BSF sources said that during their interrogations, the accused confessed that he had received the packets from one Hamal Seikh of Bithari, and had been instructed to hand over the same to Bablu Mollah, a smuggling racket operator who would send the items on to Bangladesh. “He confessed to having received Rs. 5,000 to operate as the carrier (of the silver),” a BSF spokesperson said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-120
26-08-2021||West Bengal||Ambulance delay costs Covid patient’s life in Jalpaiguri||An 18-year-old detected with Covid-19 died at the superspecialty hospital here on Wednesday as the ambulance supposed to take him to the Covid hospital at Biswa Bangla Krirangan took four hours to reach, by which the teenager had breathed his last. The distance between the two hospitals is a mere 2km and should have taken 15 minutes to cover. But scarcity of ambulances led to the delay, service providers admitted. Patient Samir Munda’s death prompted around 100 people to demonstrate at the superspecialty hospital, alleging gross neglect. Police brought the situation under control. Samir’s family filed a complaint with Kotwali police and with the office of the chief medical officer of health. Sources said on Tuesday night, the youth of Joypur tea estate on the outskirts of Jalpaiguri town got fever. As his illness got worse, his family members brought him to the superspecialty hospital around 5am on Wednesday. Doctors at the emergency wing did his rapid antigen test and found him Covid positive. They referred him to the Covid hospital and asked the family to dial 102 for an ambulance. The ambulance reached at 9am, but Samir had died, his uncle Joseph said. “We approached the doctors at this hospital but they said that as he was Covid positive, he could not be admitted. He died in front of the emergency wing. It is complete negligence on the part of the district health authorities that we lost him,” said Joseph. As the news spread, hundreds of angry residents from the tea estate reached the hospital and demonstrated for around five hours. They also confined a number of hospital officials. Arghya Sarkar, the inspector-in-charge of Kotwali police station, among other cops, spoke to demonstrators and persuaded them to withdraw. Pradhan Hembram, chief of the Trinamul-run Patkata panchayat of Jalpaiguri Sadar block, had also joined the protest. Joypur is under this panchayat. “The state government is spending crores for free treatment of Covid patients. Only because of irregular ambulance service, a youth lost his life. The district health department is responsible for his death,” said Hembram. “If no corrective steps are taken within two days, we will launch a movement on the issue along with workers of Joypur tea estate and their families,” he said. Protesters also demanded removal of Sushanta Roy, the officer-on-special-duty deputed by the state health department in north Bengal. Contacted, Roy said he has sought a report of the incident. “An inquiry has been ordered and if any negligence is found, appropriate steps would be taken,” he said. Sources in the district health department said as the number of Covid cases have declined during past few weeks, the number of ambulances engaged earlier were slashed. “As of now, there is only one ambulance in Jalpaiguri town and the Sadar block for Covid 19 patients. This ambulance, too, has not been working for the past 10 days because of mechanical problems. We are somehow managing with two other ambulances designated for Rajganj and Maynaguri blocks. Today, we asked for the ambulance for Rajganj but by the time it reached the hospital, the patient had died,” said Bablu Mohammad, the coordinator of Covid ambulance service in the district. Amid the demonstration, ward master of the superspecialty hospital Pulin Singha fell ill and was admitted to the hospital.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-120

26-08-2021||West Bengal||UN’s Darjeeling rail stamp highlights heritage tag||The United Nations (UN) on Wednesday issued a commemorative postage stamp on the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR) simultaneously from the UN offices in New York, Geneva and Vienna, underlining the importance of preserving world heritage sites at a time the Narendra Modi government is looking at monetising it. This is the first time that the DHR has been featured since the UN first issued a stamp in 1951. “The DHR had the rare distinction of being featured as one of the six stamps,” said Udaya Mani Pradhan, a philatelist from Darjeeling nominated by India Post as an honorary member of Calcutta Philatelic Club. Along with the DHR, the UN has recognised the Rideau Canal (Canada), the Grand Canal (China), the Rhaetian Railway in the Albula/ Bernina Landscapes (Switzerland/ Italy), the Forth Bridge (Scotland) and the Old Bridge Area of the Old City of Mostar (Bosnia and Herzegovina). “The DHR stamp is valued at 1.50 Swiss Franc with the words Chemins de fer, French for railways and literally means iron path,” said Pradhan. The UN has said the Mountain Railways of India has three units; the DHR and the railways of Nilgiri and Kalka-Shimla. “They are still fully operational as living examples of the engineering enterprise of the late 19th and early 20th centuries,” the UN said. In 1999, DHR was inscribed in the world heritage list by Unesco. The hill railway system has also been the subject of stamps of three countries. “The DHR has been the subject of stamps issued by Gambia, Tuvalu and by the neighbouring country of Bhutan,” said Pradhan, adding that the Indian government had also featured the DHR on postage stamps on two occasions, in 1982 and again in 1993. “In 1976, the Batasia Loop featured on the first day cover on assets of the Indian Railway,” said Pradhan. Given the DHR’s international recognition and importance, the Centre’s suggestion that mountain railways in the hills “may be” monetised has come as a major surprise as heritage structures have to maintain most of its original characters or else may lose that status. Railway enthusiasts argue maintaining heritage status would be difficult if the mountain railway is leased out to a private group. “Everything concerning the DHR, from railway stations to workshops, is part of heritage. Private players obviously will go after profits instead of investing in maintaining the heritage structures. Many changes (for modernisation) cannot be brought in world heritage sites,” said a DHR enthusiast. “One has to bear in mind that the status might be removed if Unesco feels the site has lost its originality.” In another development, the regular toy train service resumed from New Jalpaiguri to Darjeeling on Wednesday after a gap of one-and-a-half years. A diesel loco ascended to hills from New Jalpaiguri with passengers in a vistadome coach, a first class coach and a parcel van. Senior railway officials, who flagged off the train from New Jalpaiguri, said a number of initiatives have been taken to increase passengers and popularity of the heritage train. “We will introduce the Jungle-Tea-Safari by toy train from August 30. Apart from that, the parcel carriage was also added in toy trains for the first time in the past 30 years,” said Subhendu Kumar Choudhary, the divisional railway manager of the Katihar division of Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR). NFR sources said the safari is a two-hour journey. A steam loco will haul a vistadome coach from Siliguri Junction to Rongtong every day at 4pm and return. Passengers can enjoy refreshments at the dining car of the train. “During lean seasons (January-February and July to September), passengers can enjoy a 20 per cent discount in ticket prices of all rides, including joy rides, in toy trains,” said a source.

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted on Wednesday: “It gives me immense joy to announce that as of 24th August '21, more than 1 Crore people across the state have visited the #DuareSarkar camps. This year we have included more schemes & initiatives like #LakshmiBhandar, #StudentCreditCard, #KrishakBandhu (New) among others.” “I assure all that we will continue working tirelessly to ensure doorstep delivery of government services and benefits. The Government of West Bengal remains committed to the welfare of the people of Bengal,” she added. Bengal chief secretary H.K. Dwivedi also congratulated the district magistrates on Tuesday for helping the state achieve this milestone. “We have hit one crore registrations in Duare Sarkar around 10.52am today (Tuesday)... In the first edition it had taken 18 days to achieve this number. This time it is nine days. But if we count that one day was totally off this time (on Muharram), then we have done this in 8 days,”he wrote on WhatsApp to the DMs. Sources said the huge registration in the Duare Sarkar camps was primarily because the government launched the Lakshmir Bhandar scheme to offer women aged between 25 and 60 years a minimum of Rs 500 a month. While women from the general caste will get Rs 500 a month, those from SC/ST sections Rs 1,000. Beneficiaries during the first Duare Sarkar initiative were a mixed bag. This time, women turned up in droves and estimates suggest that 65 to 70 per cent of the visitors at the camps across the state registered for the Lakshmir Bhandar scheme. Sources in the government said record footfall in the camps clearly captures the distress in rural economy and the need for cash to survive amid the pandemic. Economists like Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee have repeatedly said that providing cash to common people during the pandemic should be the only way to help the flailing economy of the country. It is clearly visible from the government data that the scheme is most sought after in the districts with high migrant labour concentration, most of whom had to come back after losing their jobs, and downtrodden people. Districts such as South 24-Parganas, which always sent a large number of workers to other states as migrant labour, recorded a registration of 12,76,500 people out of its total population of 81,61,961. “If 15.64 per cent population of a district register themselves primarily for cash benefit schemes within just eight days, it has to be accepted that the scheme is a hit. The central government should take a cue from this (the Bengal government’s initiative) and focus on cash transfer schemes,” said an official. The picture is no different for districts such as Cooch Behar and Murshidabad, which also have high migrant labour population, where more than 15 per cent of their total population have registered for the scheme.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-120
26-08-2021||West Bengal||Funds set aside for Siliguri elevated road ||The Centre has allocated Rs 1,150 crore to build a 13.4km-long elevated four-lane corridor between Balason and Sevoke to ease traffic congestion in Siliguri and another Rs 800 crore for the protection of landslide-prone NH10 that links Sikkim with the rest of the country, Darjeeling BJP MP Raju Bista has said. Bista made the announcement after a meeting with Nitin Gadkari who heads the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH). The allocation of funds for the improvement of connectivity in north Bengal follows a meeting between Gadkari and chief minister Mamata Banerjee during her Delhi trip last month. Mamata had urged Gadkari to release funds for several pending projects for the state, especially in north Bengal. Even as the central grant followed Mamata’s meeting with thoe Union minister, Bista sought to claim credit for the central assistance. Bista said he had stressed during the meeting with Gadkari the need to expedite the development of Darjeeling More, the principal entry point to Siliguri and the junction of NH31 and NH55. “The minister has told me that the project has been included in the annual programme of his ministry for the 2021-22 fiscal. He said the ministry would build a 13.4km-long elevated four-lane corridor (along NH31) between Balason (located at the northwest end of Siliguri) and Sevoke and will spend around Rs 1,150 crore on the project,” the MP said. There has been a long-standing demand to decongest Darjeeling More and the elevated highway will be a step in that direction. During the meeting with Bista, Gadkari said the MoRTH had planned the expansion, redevelopment and construction of protection walls at around 20 locations though which NH10 passes with an estimated cost of around Rs 800 crore, claimed Bista. The NH10 is the principal highway that connects Sikkim and the hill district of Kalimpong with the rest of the country. During monsoons every year, traffic gets affected along the highway – especially in the Bengal part – because of recurring landslides. “We also discussed the proposal for an alternative bridge at Sevoke that is parallel to the Coronation Bridge. The minister said the 1.34km-long bridge would be built over the Teesta and the group of ministers has already granted the lease of a small parcel of railway land needed for the project,” said the MP. The Coronation Bridge that was built in 1941 is on the principal route that connects the Dooars with the hills and Siliguri. As the bridge has grown old, residents of the Dooars have time and again demanded a parallel bridge downstream the Teesta. Gadkari’s ministry, the MP said, is also working on two other projects. One of these is the construction of a 60km-long NH717A that would connect Kalimpong with Siliguri via Gorubathan. The National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) is building the alternative highway to Kalimpong and the work is expected to end by April 2023, he said. “Also, the ministry has issued a tender for conducting a feasibility study of building a ring road in Siliguri. It has received 18 bids and is examining the same,” added Bista.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-120
26-08-2021||West Bengal||Covid: 708 new cases, 10 deaths in Bengal||Bengal on Wednesday logged 708 new infections, 730 recoveries and 10 deaths. The state’s active Covid-19 cases fell by 32 to touch 9,185, making Wednesday the 66th uninterrupted day of a slide. Bengal currently has 2.8 per cent of India's active cases and occupies sixth spot among states with most such cases. With Calcutta and North 24-Parganas logging 89 new infections each, Wednesday was the 20th consecutive day again when no Bengal district reported a three-digit figure of new infections in a day. Six of the 23 Bengal districts reported single-digit figures. Fifteen districts, including Calcutta, reported zero deaths. The state’s recovery rate is 98.21 per cent, its highest yet, still fairly ahead of the national rate of 97.61. Its daily positive confirmation rate, nearly 33 per cent at the peak of the second wave, was 1.66 per cent on Wednesday. Its mortality rate is 1.19, while that of the nation is 1.34 per cent. Bengal remains 24th on the list of states with the highest mortality rates. The state currently has nearly 15.45 lakh Covid-19 cases, since the first was reported in March last year. The total includes more than 15.17 lakh recoveries and 18,393 deaths.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-120
26-08-2021||West Bengal||Assets Centre seeks to monetise are owned by country, not PM: Mamata||Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said the assets that the central government was seeking to monetise were owned by the country and not the Prime Minister or the BJP, her comments making it clear that Trinamul would amplify its criticism in the coming days. “We condemn this shocking and unfortunate decision. These assets belong to the country. It is neither the property of (Narendra) Modi nor the BJP. They (central government) can’t just sell a country's assets as per their whims and fancies,” the chief minister said at Nabanna. “The BJP should be ashamed. No one has given them the right to sell our nation’s assets,” she said. Her comments came while she was replying to questions on central teams visiting the state to inquire about state government schemes. The chief minister’s comment is significant as this is the first time she commented on the Centre’s plan of putting infrastructure assets on the block to generate revenue from private players under the National Monetisation Pipeline scheme. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had already upped the ante against the Centre for its alleged attempt to hand over the national assets to a select few industrialists. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday had announced the Rs 6 lakh crore NMP scheme that seeks to unlock value in infrastructure assets across sectors ranging from power to roads and railways. Trinamul’s Rajya Sabha chief whip Sukhendu Sekhar Ray issued a statement on Tuesday claiming the Centre was surrendering helplessly to corporate entities. On Wednesday, Mamata started from where Ray had ended and said the entire country would stand together to oppose this “anti-people” decision. She also explained why she considered the decision anti-people. “It is not a BJP affair... It is important for the entire country...nobody can do whatever they wish,” she said. Mamata juxtaposed the issue with the visit of the central teams, which are in the state to check whether the National Rural Livelihood Mission and several other rural development schemes are being properly run in Bengal. Sources in Trinamul said her comments on the monetisation of public assets were important as they hinted that she would use the NMP as an issue to attack the BJP ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. “The chief minister is eyeing the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and this particular issue could be a strong weapon for her to launch an attack on the BJP as people also have reservations against the privatisation of public assets,” said a Trinamul leader.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-120
26-08-2021||West Bengal||Nodal officers to keep tab on Covid surge in Bengal||The Mamata Banerjee government has asked district magistrates to deploy area-wise and hospital-wise nodal officers to prevent abnormal rise in Covid-19 cases amid apprehensions of the third wave of the pandemic. In an instruction sent to all the district magistrates in Bengal, chief secretary H.K. Dwivedi made it clear that they should deploy area and facility-wise nodal officers soon. “This will help the state government get real time figures in case any area is showing abnormal rise in positive cases. The area would be defined by the district authorities while deploying the nodal officers,” said a senior state government official. Another official said facility-wise deployment of nodal officers was important because that would help know whether people with Covid-19 symptoms were visiting the hospitals. “All these would help in keeping a tab on the positive cases daily. The idea is that in case any area reports higher positive cases for a few days, immediate steps could be initiated,” said a source. According to sources, the state government has plans that if any nodal officer reports unusual rise in positive cases, the first step would be to isolate the area. Then, testing and contract tracing would be done in the area. The state may also lay stress on vaccination in the area and it’s surrounding areas to prevent further spread of the virus. The sources also said the state government had also laid stress on installing equipment at hospitals on time. “At some hospitals, oxygen supply facilities are being installed and the work has to be completed on time. Certain facilities for children at some hospitals are also being installed considering the warning that children could be affected more if the third wave comes,” said a source. The state government has recently asked the district magistrates to set up micro-containment zones in case any area reports a number of positive cases. “All these steps are being initiated to ensure that the state can fight the possible third wave in an effective manner,” said a bureaucrat.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-120
26-08-2021||North East||Assam-Mizoram villagers meet to bring normalcy along border||At a time when Assam and Mizoram governments are trying to find solutions to a vexed border dispute, common people from both states have come forward to try normalise the situation. A team from Mizoram's Vairengte Village Council, visited Lailapur in Cachar to hold people-to-people discussions. Vairengte is a border village in Mizoram's Kolasib district. The village council is equivalent to the village panchayat on the Assam side and the local village bodies of both sides were engaged in the talks, officials said. The Vairengte team had taken this step keeping Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga, informed, Vairengte Joint Village Council leader Lalfangkima said. After a deadly gun battle between police forces of the two states exactly a month ago despite a peace brokered by the Union home ministry, the situation had remained tense with truckers refusing to travel from one state to another creating artificial shortages. The meeting decided that people from both sides would be able to go to villages on the other side of the state border on business or to visit friends and relatives without any hindrance. "If anybody wants to enter Mizoram for any business or any other genuine needs, he or she may go. The entire responsibility will be borne by the Mizo villagers. However, the visitor should return within the day," Lalfangkima said. For entering Mizoram, one needs an Inner-Line-Permit (ILP). The village Council is allowed to give permission to enter without ILP for a day only. Both the village parties have formed a committee to oversee movement on a regular basis and have exchanged their personal phone numbers, to facilitate coordination. Lalfangkima said that both the states depend on each other in many areas, especially in business and labour exchange. "So, we have decided to run the business in our own way till a permanent solution comes. We would like to run our life as we used to have," he added. When contacted, Cachar Superintendent of Police Ramandeep Kaur said it was an initiative at the local level and the administration was aware of the development. "It was not a formal official meeting, but an initiative by common people. This is a positive development to build a good long-lasting relationship between the two neighbours," she told. At least six Assam Police personnel and one civilian were killed and more than 50 people injured as the festering border dispute between the two Northeastern states erupted into a bloody conflict on July 26. Assam's Barak Valley districts of Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi share a 164.6 km long border with Mizoram's three districts of Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit. Both states have differing interpretations of their territorial border. While Mizoram believes that its border lies along an inner line' drawn up in 1875 to protect tribals from outside influence, Assam goes by a district demarcation done in 1933.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-8
26-08-2021||North East||Section of Cong, AIUDF in Assam hand in glove with BJP, says Sushmita Dev||Accusing a section of the Congress and AIUDF of being in cahoots with the BJP in Assam, TMC leader Sushmita Dev has said there is a "vacuum" in the opposition space in the state and the Northeast which her new party can fill. Dev, who was one of the national spokespersons of the Congress and its women's wing chief, switched over to the TMC last week. She feels her joining the TMC will not come in the way of an alliance between the two parties at the national level as "politics is not about charity". She said the Congress, too, is inducting people from other parties. "It is indeed a big change and step in my thirty-year-old political career. Politics is also about being relevant and serving the people. Certain decisions that the Congress took in the greater interest of the party had a negative impact in the area from where I come. I had felt that if we lose the 2021 election, we won't have the face to ask the electorate to vote for us again," Dev told PTI in an interview. The former Congress MP from Assam's Silchar questioned the "intent" of the Congress and opposition parties like the AIUDF of fighting against the BJP in Assam and the Northeast. "We allied in Assam to defeat the BJP. But what was demoralising was that after we lost the elections, several leaders of Congress, AIUDF and some other opposition parties started praising the chief minister. A section of leaders of these opposition parties is hand in gloves with Himanta Biswa Sarma (Assam CM). "My question is if the mainstream opposition parties have joined hands with the BJP, then where is the opposition in Assam. Who will oppose the anti-people policies of the BJP?" she asked. Noting that revival of the Congress in Assam and the Northeast is a tough task, Dev said, "There are some defeats from which you can recover and stand on your feet, and there are some defeats after which it is tough to make a turnaround." When asked what prompted her to join the TMC, she said her former party was not in a position to take on the BJP in the region. "Changing my ideology was out of the question. I am anti-BJP and will continue to oppose their divisive politics. After the assembly elections in five states, Congress lost in Assam, Puducherry, Kerala....but Mamata didi managed to sail through and stop the BJP juggernaut. She is a national leader after her spectacular victory," she said, explaining the reason for her quitting the Congress. She said the Congress, which ruled Assam for decades, is "confused". "There is an opposition vacuum in Assam and the TMC will fill this gap. they are serious about it," she said. Dev said the TMC, Mamata Banerjee and party general secretary Abhishek Banerjee are serious about fighting the BJP in Assam and other states of the Northeast but currently the main focus is on the 2023 Tripura assembly polls. When asked whether her switchover to the TMC would impact the Congress-TMC unity at the national level, Dev replied in the negative. "The TMC has made it clear that it is not poaching leaders from other parties, but if anyone is inspired by Mamata Banerjee, then they are welcome. Congress too inducts leaders from other parties such as BJP, Shiv Sena, TRS. They also induct people from diametrically opposite parties," she said. Dev, however, refrained from commenting on the accusations of a "drift in the Congress" and said the party has an able leadership. he said it was too early to comment on who will be the leader of the opposition alliance if it takes shape ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. "It is a pertinent question and it has to be answered. But the Lok Sabha polls are still three years away. It's still too early. First, we have to tell the nation that we can work together and then prove that we are a formidable force. We have to walk the talk on issues against the government and take it to task. Then at an appropriate time we can answer this question," she said. Speaking on the issue of the CAA and NRC in Assam as her new party TMC has opposed both, Dev said CAA is a half-baked solution by the BJP but maintained that the issue of the stateless people under the NRC in Assam has to be addressed. "I am neither in favour nor in opposition to CAA. The CAA evoked emotions in Assam which is what BJP wanted. Now that the election is over, they have gone silent. It is a half-baked solution. What I said was that those who were left out of the National Register of Citizens in Assam cannot remain stateless. There has to be a solution within the constitutional framework. But BJP twisted and misinterpreted my statement," she said. PTI||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-8
26-08-2021||Opinion||Letters to the editor: Demand for a national caste census||Numbers game Sir — The chief minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, recently led an all-party delegation to meet the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to press for a caste enumeration (“Caste count”, Aug 25). Although the prime minister is said to have patiently heard the concerns of the delegation, it must be remembered that it was only last month that the Union home ministry had informed Parliament that it had decided against conducting a caste-based census. Every census in independent India has, so far, only collated data on Dalits and adivasis, leaving the Other Backward Classes, the largest constituency of castes in the country, outside its purview. As of now, no political party has publicly opposed the demand of the Bihar delegation, but it is clear to all that the Bharatiya Janata Party-government is reluctant to undertake this exercise. The salience of caste as a fundamental marker of identity in India has only grown since Independence and can be one of the primary factors determining the outcome of an election. A caste-based census will have far-reaching implications for politics in the country. In recent years, questions have been raised regarding the effective implementation of affirmative action with many caste groups claiming that some have disproportionately gained while others continue to suffer. With a decrease in government jobs, there has also been a clamour for implementing quotas in the private sector. These concerns are being debated without adequate and reliable data, leading to conflicting and often misleading claims. There is an urgent need to conduct a complete caste-based census so that the government can thoroughly evaluate the needs of the people and legislate accordingly. S.S. Paul,Nadia Sir — The reason why the Narendra Modi government is non-committal about the demand for a nation-wide caste-based census is obvious. It fears that the exercise will be inimical to the interests of its core support base — the upper castes — but at the same time wants to be able to appeal to the other caste groups. If the BJP government truly wants the betterment of the people, it must not be blind to the continued ill-effects of caste divisions and the necessity for a fresh enumeration. It is a shame that even 74 years after Independence, caste continues to determine the lives of people in India. G. David Milton,Maruthancode, Tamil Nadu Wasted lessons Sir — The directive of the Bihar government ordering school teachers to sell gunny sacks to make up for the loss in revenue for the period between 2014 to 2016 under the mid-day meal scheme is deplorable (“Sold off”, Aug 19). Teachers were instructed to sell the sacks used to distribute the food grains at half the price and return the money to the government. Failure to do so would attract a charge of embezzlement. Even if the government has incurred massive losses in the mid-day meal schemes, it is not up to the teachers to compensate for that loss. The teachers’ associations in Bihar are right to protest against that directive and the suspension of Muhammad Tamizuddin — the primary school principal was accused of ‘tarnishing’ the image of the state government by hawking jute bags in the marketplace. We must all stand in solidarity with the teachers in Bihar. Shyamal Thakur,Ramnagar, East Burdwan Sir — It is unfortunate that teachers in government schools are often made to perform duties which have nothing to do with teaching. Besides classroom instruction, teachers are responsible for a plethora of administrative duties. On top of that, a Central government rule mandates that teachers can be deployed for non-educational activities such as census, disaster relief and election duties. But the Bihar government has taken it a step too far by asking teachers to sell gunny sacks to make up for the loss in revenue under the mid-day meal scheme. The Central government must intervene and put an end to such unfair practices. Anthony Henriques, Mumbai Sir — We are quick to complain that the public education system in India is lacking but how many of us have spoken up about the injustice faced by teachers in Bihar? It is time we took a stand against such draconian orders. Mohana Ganguly,Calcutta  Miraculous birth Sir — In a baffling development, a baby shark was born in an aquarium in Sardinia, Italy, where only two female sharks have lived for over a decade. Experts believe that the baby could be the result of parthenogenesis — a process where the egg can develop into an embryo without fertilization by sperm — and could be a genetic clone of its mother. If confirmed, this would be the fourth shark species to have given birth in this manner. This shows that not only do we have a lot to learn about other species, but also nature’s ability to evolve in order to regenerate life.

26-08-2021||Opinion||Nurturing freedom||As a child growing up in the Calcutta of the late 1960s and early 1970s, August 15 was the day to listen to tales of derring-do on part of sundry elderly relatives — some dead, some then still alive — who had played their part in what seemed to my untutored ears to have been an almost unending struggle for independence from British rule. Stories of how my father’s older cousin had smuggled armaments to armed revolutionaries when still a schoolboy; of my maternal grandmother learning to drive a car, ride a horse, and fire a revolver as a teenager; of how one of my father’s uncles, the redoubtable Pulin Behari Das (1877-1949), had waged a ceaseless battle against the colonial rulers, armed with little more than a lathi; of how one of my mother’s maternal uncles had so developed his physique that he could lie on his back with two wooden planks laid on his chest and have a jeep drive over him; and many more that combined the factual with the fantastical. My cousins and I would look on goggle-eyed and flappy-eared as aunts, uncles, grand-aunts, grand-uncles, and the occasional friend of one or more of them told us these stories, which often became impossibly heroic with each retelling. (For example, that Pulin Das could deflect bullets with his twirling lathi, or that our mother’s uncle of robust physique could hold back a steam locomotive using his bare hands, and so on — you get the idea.) Such reminiscences would be garnished with expressions of sorrow and lamentation at the mysterious ‘disappearance’ of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose — in the early 1970s, it was still possible to believe that the great leader would magically reappear and lead Indians in a new freedom struggle to rid society of divers ills — and the often twinned suspicion of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi’s championing of non-violence. One aunt, in particular, was fond of saying that the only reason Gandhiji was successful was because “the British allowed him to be so”, for the alternative to the Mahatma’s ahimsa was the way of the gun and the sword, which — the said aunt would emphasize — “would have won us a better freedom, you mark my words”. Of course, there were Gandhian freedom fighters in the family too, most notably on my mother’s side, including some who had abandoned the path of violence to set up ashrams and schools in rural parts — but, somehow, these pacific individuals never quite found pride of place in these storytelling sessions. Curiously enough — or so it seemed to the young me then — such valorization of heroic freedom fighters (of both the violent and non-violent kind) was accompanied by a peculiar kind of respect for what I mentally labelled as ‘English’ values, chief among them being system, discipline, and fair play. In a strange way, the family heroes who were invoked in these meandering adda sessions were those who seemed to have best internalized such values — a distant cousin of my paternal grandfather was compared unfavourably to others because he had apparently attacked (without success) an English official and his family ‘sneakily’, from the rear, in the dead of night. Serves him right to have failed and been jailed to boot, seemed to be the consensus among those aged relatives. On the rare occasion the Mahatma was praised, it was inevitably for his immaculate punctuality — yet another ‘English’ virtue held up as an example, especially for the youngest members of the gathering. As I grew older, one thing became gradually clear to me when I looked back on these cherished memories — the freedom we took for granted was not so simple a thing as our history books made it appear. Take, for example, an exchange I had with one of my uncles when I was about fifteen or so, who had made his home in the West for decades but steadfastly refused to part with his Indian passport, even though he’d had to face problems at the border checkpoints of various countries he had visited, or tried to, unsuccessfully. When I asked him why he hadn’t taken on the nationality of the country that was now his home, he said, “My father had a passport that said ‘Indian Empire’ on it. I’m no slave of Empire, I’m a free Indian citizen.” I didn’t dare point out to him that none of his children seemed to have inherited his sense of patriotism and loyalty to India since they were all citizens of the country in which my uncle lived. According to some estimates, the number of Indians who were born before Independence makes up less than 3 per cent of our population now, but when I was young practically all the adults in the family had memories of British rule; memories they were happy to regale us young ’uns with. Almost all of them are dead now, but I sometimes wonder what they would have made of today’s free India that they, or their parents’ generation, had so ardently dreamt of and fought for. Would they be satisfied with the path we have traversed in these last three-quarters of a century? Would they be disappointed at the ways in which, to quote a beloved grand-uncle, India is free but so many Indians are still in shackles? Would they be happy with our present leaders and the directions in which they are taking the country? What would they make of what our generation (rapidly approaching senior-citizen status) has done with the freedom that can, without much exaggeration, be considered their gift to us? As I was musing on such matters this Independence Day, I was reminded of a poem by the great African-American poet, Langston Hughes (1901-1967) called “Freedom” which goes like this: “Freedom will not come/ Today, this year/ Nor ever/ Through compromise and fear.// I have as much right/ As the other fellow has/ To stand/ On my two feet/ And own the land.// I tire so of hearing people say,/ Let things take their course./ Tomorrow is another day./ I do not need my freedom when I’m dead./ I cannot live on tomorrow’s bread./ Freedom/ Is a strong seed/ Planted/ In a great need./ I live here, too./ I want my freedom/ Just as you.” How have we watered and tended that strong seed of freedom that was bequeathed to us by those who came before and — perhaps more pertinently — how will those who come after us care for the tree that has sprung from that seed? Will its branches be sturdy, its leaves bright, and its fruit nourishing a quarter-century hence when the tree completes a hundred years of existence? Will all Indians be able to reap the harvest of freedom by then?

26-08-2021||Opinion||Editorial: Wrong model||It seems to be the season of epiphanies in Bengal. First, the comrades realized, all of a sudden, why the state had turned its face away from the Left during the recent assembly elections. Now, it is the turn of the Bharatiya Janata Party to pay a visit to the proverbial confession box. In a closed-door interaction, Shivprakash, a key strategist, reportedly admitted that the central leadership had committed an error by putting its trust in the replication of the ‘Uttar Pradesh model’ to wrest Bengal from the Trinamul Congress. The ‘Uttar Pradesh model’, evidently, refers to sowing the seeds of communal discord in order to mobilize the majority community. This is a time-tested strategy employed by the BJP to reap electoral dividends not just in UP but also in other states. Bengal’s long history of pluralism — the state has a sizeable representation from the Muslim community — its pride in its own cultural exceptionalism, a strategic outreach by the TMC to rectify its errors were some of the factors that kept the BJP out — for now. Is it possible that the admission would encourage the BJP to pursue an inclusive, non-partisan politics in the future? This is unlikely. The senior leader’s tone is inconsistent with the line that the BJP has taken even after its decimation in the elections. The word is that the party’s internal assessment has indicated that the blatantly polarizing campaign — it was unprecedented in the electoral history of the state — had reaped riches and that there is a case for widening the chasms between the communities in the future to secure a footing in governance. Indeed, the BJP has kept the pot boiling, with its periodic and baseless allegations of appeasement of minorities and corresponding discriminations against Hindus. The challenge for Bengal’s polity and society is to stop this poison from spreading further. For this to happen, the ruling dispensation must rise above narrow political interests when it comes to dispensing welfare. Civil society must complement this by remaining vigilant against any transgression that impairs — contaminates — the body politic.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-45
26-08-2021||Opinion||Editorial: Sweating assets||Privatization of State-owned assets has always been a hot-button issue steeped in controversy because no one appears to have worked out a way to hive them off in a sensible and transparent manner. About 30 years ago, the P.V. Narasimha Rao regime took the first fumbling steps down an uncharted road when it created arbitrary bundles of the shares that the Centre owned in about 30 public sector companies and sold them to financial institutions. Every single government since then has tried its hand at parcelling out the government’s stakes in public sector entities. Yet, the attitude towards disinvestment has always been ambivalent: political parties have backed the idea when in power and opposed it when in the Opposition. The finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, has unveiled the most ambitious programme to farm out government-owned assets to the private sector from which she hopes to raise at least Rs 6 trillion over the next four years. The National Monetisation Pipeline aims to unlock investments in public sector assets spread across 13 sectors, from roads and railways to sports stadia and urban real estate. Political rivals have accused the government of selling the family silverware — a charge that Ms Sitharaman has tried to deflect by arguing that the Centre will not be ceding ownership of the projects or the land. The NMP creates an elaborate schema for the transfer of assets and lease rights through a myriad contractual arrangements. Most of the brownfield assets will either be farmed out under toll-operate-transfer contracts or be covered by a re-imagined public-private-partnership model. But since these concessions will extend over 50 to 60 years, no one is convinced that the ownership of these assets will not change into perpetuity. The government’s estimates of the realizable value of these assets are based on some crude yardsticks. For instance, the 26,700 km of roads that will be offered through tolling contracts is valued at Rs 1.6 trillion, calculated at a factor cost of Rs 60 million per km. The NMP says that most TOT contracts have been offered between Rs 90 and 140 million per km in the past. It may be harder to justify the monetized value of the four heritage toy train railways, including the one at Darjeeling, at Rs 6.3 billion. The government is also seeking to rebuild several colonies in Delhi that house civil servants using private capital with little clarity on how the developers will recover their investment. The Vijay Kelkar committee, which submitted a report in 2015 listing suggestions to rework the PPP model, said it might be necessary to build some flexibility into the contracts. During the United Progressive Alliance regime, many of the PPP projects were stuck because of tiresome lawsuits arising from rigid provisions. That could happen again. Mr Kelkar had said the success of concessionaire arrangements would depend on the ability of the ruling dispensation to stop “abusing its sovereign authority and act more as partners and less as clients”. Will the Narendra Modi regime embrace that sage advice?||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-45
26-08-2021||Opinion||Women will not be silenced||On Pakistan’s Independence Day, a female TikToker went to Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore to make some videos. What happened there has left her scarred for life. She was sexually assaulted and harassed by 300-400 men for two and a half hours. The videos of the incident are extremely triggering — she is being thrown around like a football, her clothes are being torn and men are touching her inappropriately. One cannot even look at the videos for more than a few seconds; she, on the other hand, had to bear the assault for two and a half hours. She called the police helpline more than once. Help never came. Last month, when I wrote about Noor — a woman who was tortured and brutally murdered — in these pages, I thought I would write something different this time, something political. Instead, here I am, writing about violence against women, again. I feel angry, I feel triggered, I feel unsafe, I feel helpless. While more than a hundred men have been arrested in this case, I also know that had this incident not been recorded on video, had there not been outrage, had there not been discussion in the media about this incident, there would have been zero accountability. No policemen would have been suspended for negligence if she had not made it public that she had called the police helpline. No men would have been arrested had the video not been played and replayed on our television screens. Why? Because the State only reacts when something becomes public, when something goes viral. Women in the country are not feeling safe anywhere. When we say we feel unsafe everywhere, even in our graves, we are told by men that these are just sweeping statements, that in general, Pakistani men are very respectful towards women. When men don’t hear us or don’t want to hear us, when they dismiss our lived experiences, when they tell us that women are safe, they are stifling our voices. They are telling us to be quiet and listen to them — the men. Two more videos surfaced after this incident; these were quite disturbing too. In one of them, a woman in a Chingchi rickshaw with another woman and child was stuck in traffic while men catcalled her and made videos. Suddenly, a man jumped onto the Chingchi and forcibly kissed the woman. Another video shows a woman keeping men at bay with a stick every time they try to come near her to harass her. And yet, we are being told by men that just because a few incidents take place here and there, it does not mean that women are unsafe. I wish that men would stop telling women how to feel, what to say, what to do, what to wear, where to go and so on. We know that what we are feeling is what most women feel. We know that women are not feeling safe after receiving news of Noor’s beheading, after seeing a woman being groped and assaulted by hundreds of men in a public place, after seeing a woman being forcibly kissed by a man when she was on the road, after reading about a 14-year-old girl’s corpse being dug out from her grave and then raped. How can we feel safe after we hear about such incidents every day? How do we not get triggered or feel angry at how men enjoy so much impunity while victims are questioned each time. After the Minar-e-Pakistan incident, we saw apologists trying to justify what happened by asking why the female TikToker had invited her fans for a meet-and-greet and arguing that this was bound to happen. No, this should not have happened, period. Men should not behave like maniacs every time they see a woman. These are the same men who get outraged when women take out an Aurat March around the country, they are enraged when women shout, ‘Mera Jism, Meri Marzi’ (My Body, My Choice), because at the end of the day, these men think that women don’t have any rights. When they circulate fake videos endangering the lives of several women, nobody is held accountable. It is the women who have to set the record straight about the videos being morphed and fake. Not the men who circulated them. And yet, women are not even allowed to say they are feeling unsafe. But we will keep saying it until and unless our society changes, until each man realizes how unsafe we feel — everywhere. We will keep raising our voices and nobody can stop us. We, the women, demand justice for every injustice. We, the women, will not be silent. We, the women, will ask uncomfortable questions. We, the women, will always stand up against each and every case of violence against women and make the culprits answerable.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-45
26-08-2021||Jharkhand||Tata Steel biodiversity pledge continues for 114 years ||Tata Steel on Thursday inaugurated a new rain water harvesting pond followed by ground breaking of the rejuvenation of existing water bodies at the sprawling CRM Bara complex in Sidhgora area of steel city in an attempt to improve biological diversity. The inauguration of the project took place on a historic day as Tata Steel on Thursday completed 114 years of journey. It was on August 26, 1907, that Tata Steel was founded as it got its registration in India. The inaugural function of the project was graced by Chanakya Chaudhary, vice- president, Corporate Services, Tata Steel,  Sudhansu Pathak, vice- president , (Steel Manufacturing) and several other senior officials of the company and Tata Steel Utilities and Infrastructure Services Limited ( formerly Jusco ). Addressing the function Chaudhary said, “We are committed to the conservation, enhancement and restoration of biodiversity in all our areas of operation. The rejuvenation project reaffirms our strategic commitment to improve water sustainability and biodiversity of the region.” Sharing his views on the project, Sudhansu Pathak said, “As part of our eco-friendly initiative and our commitment to long term water sustainability, it was envisaged to rejuvenate a dying water body and restore the same. Accordingly, the ancient water bodies have once again been restored to its pristine glory, thereby enhancing the local biodiversity.” The CRM Bara rejuvenation project that was completed in 2020-21 resulted in the creation of a larger rainwater harvesting facility, improvement in water table of the local area and increase in biological diversity. The total water storage capacity with the inauguration of the new rain water harvesting pond now becomes 95000 cubic meters. So far, around 20-acres of existing water bodies have been developed into rain water harvesting ponds and green belts. The proposal is to rejuvenate another 15-acres of existing water bodies into new rain water harvesting ponds at the CRM Bara complex. Significantly, Tata Steel is the first corporate in India to launch its Biodiversity Policy in 2016. The policy provides guidelines for including biodiversity in every strategic and operational decision making.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-62

26-08-2021||Jharkhand||CII Jharkhand holds MSME conclave on virtual platform||The Confederation of Indian Industry's Jharkhand state unit on Thursday organised the third edition of its annual flagship initiative, MSME Conclave. The conclave on the theme "Breaking Barriers to Unlock Hidden Potential" was organised over a virtual platform. The third MSME Conclave deliberated on government schemes for MSMEs and MSME financing, Start ups and challenges, opportunities and managing business in the prevailing difficult scenario. Addressing the conclave, Tapas Sahu, vice- chairman, CII Jharkhand State Council and CEO of Highco Engineers Pvt Ltd stated that the MSME sector has the potential to spread industrial growth across the country and can be a major partner in the process of inclusive growth. "The contribution of MSME is eight per cent of GDP, 45 per cent of manufacturing output and 40 per cent of exports of the country and uniquely they are least investment driven with high returns," he explained. According to Sahu, the Covid-19 pandemic is taking a toll from a human and public health standpoint, along with causing massive business disruption, resulting in some businesses shutting down completely. He pointed out that among all the sectors, MSMEs were badly hit during this difficult time and went on to explain that the current economic situation is not conducive to small industries as there is restricted liquidity in the system, though the government pumped in stimulus to keep the sector alive. Addressing the online conclave, Ashok Saigal, co-chairman, CII National MSME Council and managing director, Frontier Technologies Pvt Ltd said that MSMEs are the backbone of India’s economy. "However, for India to grow exponentially we need these MSMEs to mature into large firms in the decade to come. The pandemic situation has led to a substantial movement of the companies to the other developing and less developed countries which has triggered a new wave of industrialization. Consequently, the expansion of the manufacturing hub linked with global supply chains would increase not only productivity but also create large-scale employment. The outbreak has provided India an opportunity to follow an export driven model where we have several capabilities already in place and several need to be built," he said. Another speaker Ranjot Singh, vice- chairman, CII Jamshedpur Zonal Council said that MSMEs in the manufacturing sector alone produce more than 6,000 products and contribute 7.7 per cent of the GDP of the country. "In spite of their contribution, MSMEs in India face several challenges. They often need to keep pace with rapidly changing technologies and face the risk of becoming technologically obsolete," he pointed out. Among others who addressed the conclave included Dr S K Sahoo, joint director, department of industries, Jharkhand, Jyoti Prakash Gadia, co- chairman of CII National MSME Council and managing director, Resurgent India Ltd,  R K Singh, assistant general manager,  Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and Suresh Narasimha, founding partner, Co Create Ventures.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-62

An Intensive awareness programme among the street vendors of Jharia Sabji Patti Market, Jharia main road, Gandhi road, Laxminia more and other localities will be launched by the civic body which will also hold a meeting of Town Vending Committee members to participate in the allotment process of shops which would be made through a lottery system. The vending zone situated on 1100 square meter area for which the construction began in February 2019 is equipped with drinking water facility, besides 24 toilets, a guardroom, a proper lighting arrangement and a parking facility for customers as well as street vendors. Talking to The Telegraph Online on Thursday, Chandrashekhar, City Manager of Dhanbad Municipal Corporation, said, “We will begin the process of allotment of shops in vending zone after launching the awareness drive in a day or two and proper announcement in different market areas of Jharia would be carried out to ensure the maximum participation of street vendors.” “The pedestals erected as shops have space below having a locker like facility where the allottees can keep their articles, safely after locking out the space,” said Chandrashekhar and added that the allotment of shops in vending zone of Baniahir, will help to address the long pending issue of congestion at Jharia Bata More, Sabzi Patti etc. “The allotment of shops and vending zones will shield the street vendors against any kind of eviction by the police or administration during the anti-encroachment drives, which they regularly face while operating at non- designated places of operation,” further said Chandrashekhar. “Besides the development of vending zones at Baniahir we have also initiated a process for the development of vending zones at Hirapur Hatia Market and Katras Hatia Market for which the tender has already been finalised and construction work is likely to begin in one week,” said Chandrashekhar. “Besides constructing and allotting the vending zones we are also engaged in a survey of street vendors of the district as part of the government plan to provide QR Code Smart Identity Card as well as QR Code Smart Certificate of vending,” said Chandrashekhar. Welcoming the development, Sneham Sinha, district coordinator of National Association of Street Vendors of Jharia said, “We welcome the completion of first vending zone of Dhanbad and would request the authorities to adopt a transparent and error free process of allotment of shops for the benefit of one and all.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-62
26-08-2021||Jharkhand||Five Jharkhand airports to be powered by solar energy||Five airports in Jharkhand, including the Birsa Munda Airport in Ranchi, will soon be powered by solar energy, officials of Jharkhand Renewable Energy Development Agency (JREDA) said on Thursday, adding that the tender for this project has already been floated. JREDA Director K.K. Verma said that each of the airports equipped with solar panels will produce 600 KiloWatt of power every day once the project is complete. Solar energy produced in these airports will not only light up the airport premises, but also provide power to some of the residential colonies close to the airports, another JREDA official said. “The tender for this project has been floated and the last date for bidding is September 1. At least five airports in the state will be powered by solar energy under the project,” said Verma. Besides Ranchi airport,  airports in Dumka, Deoghar, Bokaro and Giridih will be covered under the project. While the Birsa Munda Airport is the only fully-operational airport in Jharkhand at present, some of the remaining four airports in the list are likely to start operations within a year, sources said. JREDA officials said the government has allocated a fund of Rs 20 crore for the project with a target of completing the project in six months. The initiative was important for Jharkhand as most of the airports in the state were at a developing stage and incorporating eco-friendly changes at this stage would benefit in the longer run, an official at Ranchi airport said. Birsa Munda Airport  is also likely to undergo major expansion in the days to come and the use of renewable energy will be a boon, an official from the Ranchi airport said. The state government has approved the expansion plan of the Ranchi airport and signed an MoU with the AAI for a 330acre  expansion project. Currently, Ranchi airport has about 20 flights connecting the state to Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Pune and a few other cities. Many airports in other parts of India have relied on solar energy in the past couple of years in an effort to ensure eco-friendly development. The Puducherry Airport in Tamil Nadu became the first completely solar-powered airport under the Airport Authority of India (AAI) back in 2020. Besides, the Cochin International Airport in Kerala, run in a public-private partnership mode, is claimed to be the first solar-powered airport in the world.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-63
26-08-2021||Jharkhand||Rajesh Thakur named Jharkhand Congress chief||The All India Congress Committee (AICC)  appointed Rajesh Thakur as president of the state Congress unit on Wednesday, replacing  Rameshwar Oraon who is finance minister in the Hemant Soren-led coalition government. According to a notification issued by AICC national general secretary K. C. Venugopal,  some office-bearers were replaced too. Singhbhum MP Geeta Koda, wife of former chief minister Madhu Koda, Mandar MLA Bandhu Turkey, Jaleshwar Mahto and Sahjada Anwar were made co-working presidents of the state unit with immediate effect. The change of guard in the state Congress was initiated in the wake of an ongoing tussle within the party that is a part of the ruling coalition in Jharkhand with the JMM and RJD. The party had announced a one-man, one-post policy during the 2019 assembly elections. After the coalition came to power, Oraon became the finance minister in the incumbent government. Since then, a section of party MLAs and workers has been pressing for his removal citing the pre-poll announcement, said sources. Recently, the party found itself at the centre of a controversy after the arrest of three "lobbyists" for allegedly plotting to topple the Hemant Soren government. The trio was reportedly in touch with three disgruntled MLAs of Congress.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-63
26-08-2021||Jharkhand||Hazaribagh residents resort to Jal Satyagraha agitation ||Nearly 10 residents of Hazaribagh resorted to Jal Satyagraha agitation by standing inside the polluted Hazaribagh Lake for over five hours from 10am to protest against the encroachment of water bodies allegedly under the patronage of the administration. The residents who were supported by the OBC Morcha of Hazaribagh district Congress stood in the water body filled with water hyacinth and algal growth because of lack of cleaning, and in the evening submitted a memorandum addressed to Hazaribagh deputy commissioner Aditya Kumar Anand. “There are nearly seven lakes and over six major drains in the Hazaribagh city and unfortunately all of which have been encroached to the large extent by land mafias who sell it to gullible masses. The land mafias have the support of local land revenue officials who do not oppose to such illegal work which is in contravention of the Jharkhand High Court order of this year prohibiting encroachment of water sources,” said Surjeet Nagwala, president of the Congress Hazaribagh district OBC unit. The Congress leader has warned that if the district administration fails to undertake action within a month against land mafias who are responsible for encroachment of water bodies, they will be forced to file a petition in Jharkhand High Court. The agitators claimed that Hazaribagh Jheel has not been cleaned for over a year which has led to the growth of water hyacinth and algal along with other garbage. “The land mafias have got emboldened because of the tacit support of the administration and this has led to more encroachment which is leading to water clogging even after moderate rain in the city as the outlets have been closed or encroached. Seeing that the administration is doing nothing, we, the local residents, decided to take it upon us and have sent an alert to the administration about mass objection to such acts and if no proper action is undertaken against land mafias then we would be forced to take legal steps,” said Jawaharlal Sinha another local resident and a Congress leader. The members also demanded that the lake which is an icon for the district should be cleaned immediately as it is affecting the aquatic animals too. Hazaribagh deputy commissioner Anand said any comments could be made after seeing the memorandum of the agitators. “I am yet to see the memorandum submitted by the agitators. Only after reading the memorandum and identifying the water bodies alleged to have been encroached, I can give an explanation,” Anand said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-63
