Children, dressed up as vegetable vendors, sat with a few vegetables. The teachers played the role of customers. The kids took turns selling vegetables to their teachers and sometimes to their parents. This activity was conducted by the teachers to make the little ones understand that eating vegetables is an important part of a balanced and healthy diet. Moreover, they learnt about different vegetables, their colours, shapes and they also learnt counting when they were asked to buy or sell. “We always believe in fun learning methods. The pandemic could not dampen our spirits and Veg-a-day was one such event. Children dressed up as vegetable vendors and teachers were buyers. Colours of vegetables, the benefits of eating veggies, counting and speaking confidently — all were practised in just one fun learning. In fact, this is what the National Education Policy 2020 also speaks about,” said headmistress Poushali Mukherjee. Ruby Park Public School recently conducted Genius Junior, a virtual inter-school fest for kids. The online fest provided a platform to the primary students from 25 schools across the city to sharpen their skills through a myriad of activities. Students of UKG to Class IV took part in a total of 10 events such as Rhythm Divine, Tell-a-Tale, Pantomime and Eggcellent to name a few. “Genius Junior has created a virtual platform for multiple talents of the young school children across the city. The whole experience of assessing the contestants was extremely enriching,” said principal Joyita Majumder. The monotony of online classes took a break with Fun fiesta, a virtual summer camp organised by Hindmotor schools — Hindmotor High School, HM Education Centre and Angel’s Eden Pre-school and Day Care, Uttarpara and Rajarhat branches. The camp brought in various fun activities for kids to explore. The parents also took part in the camp with their children and separately in activities such as mandala making and zumba. The week-long virtual camp included yoga, art and craft, science experiment, aerobics, western dance, non-fire cooking, puppet show, graphic designing and many more activities for students aged three to 11 years. “Kids can explore their creativity and passion through these activities that make them more lively and contribute to their holistic development. This is the first time we organised this unique summer camp online which was a great success. We thank the parents for encouraging their children and also sportingly taking part in the activities,” said HM schools managing committee rector Sudipta Bose. The four branches of Apeejay schools took part in an interactive programme to mark the National Reading Day on June 19. The magical world of fiction was explored by the students as they read out their favourite stories or recited poems. The Class IX students of the Salt Lake branch enacted the last scene of The Bishop’s Candlesticks, giving the audience a memorable experience. The event was also meant to sharpen the oratorical and technical skills of the children. “Reading is the single most important skill for intellectual, academic and personality development of children. At Apeejay schools, reading is an integral part of our curriculum. The National Reading Day was yet another effort of ours to ensure that our children read, understand, comprehend and are able to express thoughts and views to make a difference,” said Apeejay schools’ CEO Kiranjit Singh Pannu. Students of classes VI to IX at Sri Sri Academy celebrated the World Yoga Day (June 21) by staging a play online. It was the result of an advanced yoga challenge that the students were part of and it depicts the benefits of yoga. There were recorded videos, graphics and animation to go with the enactment. At the end, the actual process of yogic breathing was demonstrated. “Yoga is vital for young students to tackle lack of deep rest and sleep, bring about clarity of thought and purpose. We believe it is essential to practise yoga in student life to have a pleasant and well-rounded personality,” said principal Suvina Shunglu.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-13
19-08-2021||Calcutta||B-school gets full-term director||Uttam Kumar Sarkar, a professor of management information system group at IIM Calcutta, has been appointed as director of the institute. The search for a new head was necessitated after Anju Seth, the Joka B-school’s first woman director, had resigned in March, almost a year before her term was to end. The institute has since been helmed by Subir Bhattacharya as officiating director. Srikrishna Kulkarni, the chairperson of the institute’s board of governors, announced Sarkar’s appointment in a message uploaded on the board’s website on Wednesday. “The board observed that Prof. Sarkar has an outstanding academic record, both as a student and a teacher,” the message reads. Sarkar, 56, had passed the higher secondary exams in 1983 from Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur. He completed BTech, MTech and PhD from the department of computer science and engineering at IIT Kharagpur. He was dean, new initiatives and external relations, at IIM Calcutta from April 2015 to April 2018. His research interests include machine learning, social networks analysis, artificial intelligence and discrete optimisation. Before joining the B-school in 1997, Sarkar had been a lecturer in the department of computer science and engineering at Jadavpur University. He was an assistant professor in the department of management studies at IIT Delhi from 1996 to 1997. Sarkar joined the Joka institute as professor of management information systems group in 2005. “I look forward to working on in areas like academic excellence and superior physical and virtual infrastructure,” he told Metro. A teacher at the IIM said Sarkar should not face any difficulty in running the institute as he had been associated with it for over two decades as a teacher and a dean. “Anju Seth had to spend a considerable part of her tenure, from August 2018, fighting with board members and teachers. The institute lacked in taking constructive steps and IIM-C is increasingly conceding its space to peers like IIM-Ahmedabad and IIM-Bangalore. Amid the pandemic, when online classes are posing new challenges, we needed a director who could lead,” the teacher said. On March 10, IIM-C had invited applications for the post of director. The advertisement said the applicant “is expected to provide strong academic leadership”. The newer challenges, an official said, included introducing facilities like hybrid classes that are becoming popular amid the pandemic.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-13
19-08-2021||Calcutta||Covid: Vaccination drive for students at IIM Calcutta||Calcutta launched a vaccination drive on its campus on Tuesday after it emerged in a survey that most of the students who have been recalled were partially vaccinated. The institute, which is calling students of the two-year MBA programme back to the campus so they could attend online classes from hostels, is insisting students on having both doses. Students in groups are undergoing vaccination in a facility set up on the campus. “The survey revealed that most of the students have yet to receive the second jab. Vaccination is seen as an antidote to Covid. The students’ council that carried out the survey has initiated the drive,” said Manish Thakur, dean (new initiatives and external relations) and a member of the Covid committee of the IIM. Lokesh Agarwal, the secretary of the students’ council, said of the 650 students who have been called back, 500 have not taken the second jab. “The hostel staff will be inoculated, too. Most of them have only taken the first dose,” Agarwal said. The institute did not cite vaccination as a condition before letting all the 80 one-year MBA executive programme students and 50 per cent of the students of the two-year programme enter hostels and attend online classes last month. The Telegraph had reported last Thursday that with more students willing to return to campus because of connectivity woes at home, the institute is now advising all to get vaccinated. The institute has decided to recall another 25 per cent of students to the campus this month, taking the percentage of recalled students to 75 per cent.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-13
19-08-2021||Calcutta||1,000 women to be screened for cervical cancer||The Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the Tata Medical Center in New Town have joined hands to screen 1,000 women from the Topsia-Tiljala area for cervical cancer. According to a doctor of the hospital, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women in India, the first being breast cancer. Women to be identified for the screening, which is likely to start later this year or early next year, will give their samples (scraped from the cervix) at home or at primary health centres of the civic body. The screening will be done in wards 56, 57 and 58 as part of a pilot project. The women will be given a brush to take the scraping, something they can do on their own. This will make the process easier for the women. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has set a target to eliminate cervical cancer by 2030. “Cervical cancer is preventable and curable, as long as it is detected early and managed effectively,” says the WHO website. “There are two parts of the project. In the first part, the women will be screened for the presence of human papillomaviruses (HPV), which is the cause of cervical cancer in 99 per cent cases. Those who test positive in the screening will have to undergo confirmatory tests,” said Sonia Mathai, a gynaecological oncologist at the Tata Medical Center and the coordinating officer of the project. “If the confirmatory test shows precancerous changes in the cervix, the woman will be provided with appropriate treatment at a primary health centre. Women detected with early cervical cancer will be referred to a hospital for the treatment.” The cost of the tests will be included in funding of the project by the department of biotechnology after final approval. The department has given in-principle approval for the project. “As part of the project, 1,000 women will be screened in three wards of the CMC. The accredited social health activists (ASHA) will sensitise people and create awareness among women to undergo the test,” said a senior doctor of the CMC. Mathai said as per Globocan 2020 data, 77,348 women died in India from cervical cancer. The WHO website says to eliminate cervical cancer by 2030, 90 per cent of the girls had to be fully vaccinated with the HPV vaccine by the age of 15; 70 per cent of women screened by the age of 35, and again by the age of 45, among several other measures to be adopted.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-13
19-08-2021||Calcutta||Malaria cases on the rise in Calcutta||A number of malaria cases have been reported from several parts of Calcutta since July, doctors of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation said. The doctors are worried because many of the cases reported so far this year are Plasmodium falciparum malaria, which can cause severe illness. An official of the civic body said over 2,600 malaria cases had been reported in Calcutta since January. Nearly three-fourths of these cases have been reported since July. About 300 of the 2,600 malaria cases reported since January were P. falciparum malaria cases, said the official. The four boroughs — IV, V, VI and VII — covering areas like College Street, Esplanade, Topisa-Tiljala and Park Street have reported the maximum number of cases since July. The World Health Organisation (WHO) website mentions that “malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female anopheles mosquitoes”. The spurt in the number of malaria cases was discussed at a conference of senior doctors of the CMC on Wednesday. “The jump in malaria is a matter of concern. The numbers reported so far this year are not only more than last year but also more than the corresponding period in 2019,” said a CMC doctor. The malaria parasites spread through the bite of infected mosquitoes. An uninfected mosquito picks up the parasite by biting an infected human. When this mosquito goes on to bite an uninfected human, it can pass on the parasite to that person. The lockdown in 2020 had helped keep malaria under control, said CMC doctors. “There are still some restrictions on movement, though not as strict as it was in 2020. But the current relaxations are also not anywhere close to 2019,” said a doctor. “It is a matter of concern that about 300 cases of P. falciparum malaria have been reported this year. P. falciparum malaria causes malignant malaria and can impact the brain,” said a CMC doctor. A drop in the intensity of vector-control measures in earlier months of the year could be a reason why the number has been so high this year, said some civic doctors. The scale and intensity of vector-control work suffered as many of the honorary health workers or accredited social health activists (ASHA) were busy with the Covid vaccination programme. “The field workers who used to visit every home to check for the mosquito breeding spots were busy with vaccination. Now that we are in the middle of the monsoon, breeding spots have increased and the cases have also risen,” said a CMC doctor.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-13
19-08-2021||Calcutta||10-year-old run over by lorry in Taratala||A 10-year-old girl was killed after being knocked down by a goods vehicle loaded with bags of cement on Goragacha Road in Taratala on Wednesday afternoon. Eye witnesses told police Sanjana Das was cycling near her house on Goragacha Road when the lorry knocked her down around 3.05pm. The cycle was flung away and Sanjana came under one of the front wheels of the lorry. She was declared dead at SSKM Hospital. Soon after the accident, a section of residents stopped the lorry, pulled out driver Ramesh Yadav and beat him up. The crowd continued to swell for some time bringing traffic on Goragacha Road to a halt. Officers from Taratala police station and Southwest traffic guard went to the spot and rescued Yadav from a clutch of angry youths. Goragacha Road connects Diamond Harbour Road with Transport Depot Road in Calcutta’s port area, cutting through several industrial units and small localities on either side of the road. With traffic temporarily stopped after the accident, some vehicles were diverted through Transport Depot Road to avoid the queuing up of Diamond Harbour Road-bound vehicles. “The truck was headed towards Diamond Harbour Road from Goragacha Road in the afternoon when the accident occurred. Since the driver received injuries, he has been admitted to SSKM Hospital,” said a senior officer of the Taratala police station. The police said a case of causing death by negligence under section 304A of the IPC has been drawn up against Yadav. He will be questioned after he recovers. The vehicle has been seized and a test will be done to find out if there was a mechanical failure resulting in the fatal accident. Earlier on Tuesday night, a sergeant of the East traffic guard was injured when a motorcyclist hit him on Kidderpore Road around 9.10pm. Ranjit Saha injured his left leg and was admitted to Belle Vue Clinic. He was discharged later. The Kidderpore Road accident took place within a few hours of a private car hitting a 62-year-old woman on RG Kar Road on Tuesday. Samriti Sarkar was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and later shifted to a private hospital in Ballygunge.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-13
19-08-2021||Calcutta||Belur Math reopens to visitors after a little over three months||Belur Math reopened to visitors on Wednesday after remaining shut for a little over three months. At the gates of the main entrance to the Math, the global headquarters of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, all visitors were screened for their Covid vaccination certificates and identity documents. Beginning Wednesday, Belur Math will remain open from 8am to 11am and from 4pm to 5.45pm. Senior monks said the footfall on Day-1 was higher in the morning than in the evening. Visitors are allowed to enter the Ramakrishna, Sri Sarada Devi, Swami Vivekananda and Swami Brahmananda temples. The Pally Mangal stall and the bookstore are also open. The Math had shut its gates for visitors on April 22 following a renewed surge in Covid cases. It reopened for a day on July 24, on the occasion of Guru Purnima. The authorities have decided that visitors turning up at the Math will have to produce a certificate showing they have received two doses of a Covid vaccine and an identity proof. Alternatively, a negative result of an RT PCR test for Covid has to be produced along with an identity proof. The test has to be conducted within 72 hours before the visit. The proof of identity could be the Aadhaar card, PAN card or the voter card, Math officials said. “All visitors were asked to produce their documents before they were scanned with thermal guns for their body temperature and offered hand sanitisers,” said a senior monk. “We have sought the help of the Howrah police commissionerate to ensure that social distancing is maintained. The footfall is likely to go up on Sunday on the occasion of Rakhi Purnima.” On Wednesday, volunteers stood at the entrance to all temples. Only a small number of visitors were allowed inside at a time. The road to the main temple has been split into two, using guardrails and nylon ropes, for entry and exit. The Math authorities have done away with the ritual of distributing prasad. Devotees are not allowed to gather inside the Ramakrishna temple during the evening prayer. They are also barred from meeting Swami Smaranananda, the president of the order, and other senior monks. The Math is home to nearly 300 monks and around 250 employees.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-14
19-08-2021||Calcutta||Durga Puja clock ticks on Kumartuli||Prasanta Pal is not sure whether half of his 16-odd Durga idols would move out of the studio this year. Less than two months to Durga Puja, there aren’t enough takers for Pal’s idols. A few old clients who dropped by said they could not afford him. Around this time of the year, after the neighbourhood Durga Puja meetings are over on Independence Day, Kumartuli would usually be abuzz with puja organisers dropping in to select and book idols. The organisers would move from one studio to another, talking to artisans and haggling over price. For several puja organisers, a trip to Kumartuli after the meeting on Independence Day is akin to a ritual, like performing kathamo (structure) pujo on Rath Yatra to mark the beginning of the making of the Durga idol. Covid brought about a sea change last year and the situation has remained the same - or worsened in some aspects - this year. The lanes and bylanes of Kumartuli are mostly empty. Missing is the frenzy among artisans, helpers and labourers, and most idol frames are yet to be tagged “Sold”. The fear of a fresh wave of Covid infections, coupled with the apathy of sponsors to release funds, is taking a toll on the organisers. The organisers of a number of mid-range pujas said they were struggling to finalise their budgets. A few others said they couldn’t afford the cost of transporting idols from Kumartuli. Instead, they have settled for idol hubs closer home. “Last year, when sponsors weren't too many, a few of the organisers had arranged for cash donations so the booking amounts for the idols, pandals and lights could be paid. That is missing this year,” said Jaydeep Saha, a member of a puja committee in Belgachhia. “During the second wave of Covid, we had to spend from our puja savings to arrange for food, medicines and oxygen cylinders for residents of our neighbourhood. Now, we have no clue how to arrange for funds for the puja.” Like the puja committee from Belgachhia, many others have called up their usual idol makers and told them they would buy an idol “since Durga Puja has to be organised”, but none could quote a price range. Kumartuli, where around 360 artisans work in 120-odd studios, would receive orders worth close to Rs 50 crore during Durga Puja till 2019. This year the volume would be just about 30 per cent of that, many artisans fear. The required idol size has come down from 12-14 feet to just about 6-8 feet, and so has the price tag. Idols tailor-made for themes are out of the question and most artisans have cut down on the number of idols they will build. “From 45 to 50 idols, I have cut it down to about 30 this year,” said Babu Pal, the secretary of the Kumartuli Mritshilpi Sankritik Samity. “Artisans are not ready to invest in more idols. Many families have done away with Durga Puja this year because of Covid deaths in their families.” The bulk of the artisans who have to hire godowns in Kumartuli spending close to a lakh for each said they were worried about repaying loans to mahajans (money lenders). “An artisan does mental calculations about the number of idols he would build in a season and the returns he expects. Accordingly, he takes out a loan. This year, everything has gone awry,” said Prasanta. Durga Puja organisers said they were being forced to cut down on all expenses since the flow of funds from big sponsors and advertisers was uncertain this time. No one is sure whether stalls — around the pandal — will be allowed. That would mean another source of revenue lost. “In 2019, we spent around Rs 2 lakh on our Durga idol. This time our budget for the idol is Rs 50,000,” said Debasish Bhattacharya, an organiser of a Durga Puja in north Calcutta. “Had the situation been normal, bamboo poles for the pandal would have been erected by now.” A clearer picture will emerge by next Sunday, said Amalendu Sarkar of the Maddox Square puja committee. Some organisers are hopeful though that the fear of a fresh round of infection would finally make way for overwhelming optimism and sponsors would gradually start loosening their purses. “We still believe that things won’t be as grim as they are now. With increased vaccine coverage, this year should look better than the previous one,” said Saswata Basu, the secretary of the Forum for Durgostav, an umbrella organisation of about 350 pujas in Calcutta.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-14
19-08-2021||Calcutta||IIT Kharagpur scholarship for top-rank aspirants||Some institutions that “are below IIT Kharagpur are also superseding” the oldest IIT in the country and “this is a cause of concern”, IIT Kharagpur director V.K. Tewari said at the institute’s 71st foundation day programme. If the institute does not improve its performance, “then the junior, second-generation, third-generation IITs will supersede us”, Tewari said in his speech. To attract brighter students, India’s oldest IIT on Wednesday introduced the Pandit Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar Scholarship, which will cover the tuition and hostel expenses of an IIT Kharagpur student if he or she is among the top 100 on the JEE-Advanced merit list. Students have to crack the JEE-Advanced to gain entry into any of the IITs. “This is the first IIT of the IIT system in the country. Now where have we reached? I was just going through our performance. In fact, about five years back, we were at 281 in the QS ranking. And we are 280 now. Our position in the last year or so, I think now we are sixth in the line and we find that some of our people (institutions) who are below us, are also superseding us. This is a cause for concern,” Tewari said. The London-based Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) released the QS World University Ranking 2022 in June. Three Indian institutions — IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi and IISc Bangalore — feature among the top 200. IIT Madras and IIT Kanpur, ranked 255 and 277, respectively, are ahead of IIT Kharagpur. The Kharagpur institute had ranked fifth under the engineering category in the NIRF, a ranking exercise carried out by the education ministry, in 2020. Tewari said the institute had to focus more on areas like citation and patent, and attract bright teachers and students to improve its standing. “Otherwise, other people, other junior IITs, the second-generation, third-generation IITs will supersede us. Therefore, we have to have strategies and methodologies,” Tewari said. The Pandit Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar Scholarship will be rolled out in the 2021-22 academic year and will cover the entire expenses of a student. Apart from the tuition and hostel fees, it will cover miscellaneous costs like relocation and personal expenses. The scholarship will have an out-of-pocket allowance, leaving the student free to focus on studies, an official of the institute said. The annual tuition fee is Rs 1 lakh for students whose family’s annual income is above Rs 5 lakh. In addition, a student has to pay a hostel establishment charge of Rs 15,125, a hostel overhead charge of Rs 12,000 and other charges each semester. “We are going to help you with each and every penny of your expenditure. We want achievers here,” Tewari said. In recent years, only a few students among the top 100 on the JEE-Advanced merit list have been opting to study at IIT Kharagpur. Metro has reported that only three of the top 200 students who had cracked the JEE-Advanced in 2017 had opted for IIT Kharagpur. The situation has not changed much. The website of the seat allocation authority, which conducts counseling for admission to the IITs, says the ranks for admission to the computer science and engineering programme at IIT Kharagpur last year were in the 180-293 range in the general category. The ranks for the same programme at IIT Bombay last year were between 2 and 66.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-14

Aduri Mondal approached sergeant R.N. Layak to report that a man on the bus on the Shyambazar-Malancha route snatched her phone and jumped out when she raised the alarm. She told the police that he had crossed the road, hailed a yellow cab and went away in the opposite direction along Basanti Highway. All this happened within a few minutes.. The cop immediately left on his motorcycle and caught up with the taxi not far from the Science City crossing after a 2-km chase. The man denied having anyone else's phone on him but the woman's mobile was recovered and handed back to her. The accused was arrested. The incident happened close to gate number one of the Calcutta Leather Complex around 8.40am, police said. “By the time the bus was stopped and Mondal could alight to chase the snatcher, the man had crossed the road and boarded the taxi,” said an officer in the traffic department. Mondal then reported the matter to sergeant Layak, who was not far from the spot. Acting on the instructions of officer-in-charge of Tiljala traffic guard Souvik Chakraborty, Layak started chasing the taxi on his official motorcycle and caught up with the four wheeler at Bamanghata. “The accused, later identified as Sheikh Manirul, had initially denied charges of theft. But on questioning for a few minutes, he apparently admitted his fault and took out the stolen phone from his pocket,” the officer said. The phone was handed over to Mondal. Manirul was handed over to the local police station, where he was arrested under the IPC section related to theft.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-14
19-08-2021||Calcutta||Covid: District jab backlog shows in patient data||At several private hospitals in Calcutta, Covid patients from districts outnumber those from the city. Most of the patients from districts, hospital officials said, are unvaccinated. Public health experts said the comparative figures showed that the vaccination drive in districts needed to be intensified. The RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences had 11 Covid patients on Wednesday, of whom nine were from districts of Bengal. Peerless Hospital had 16 Covid patients, of whom 11 were from districts. Three Covid patients were admitted to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals on Tuesday, of whom two are from districts. "Of the 11 Covid patients being treated at our hospital, four are admitted in the critical care unit. None of the patients in the critical care unit is vaccinated. Three patients in the general Covid ward, all from districts, are unvaccinated,” said R. Venkatesh, regional director, east, Narayana Health, of which the RN Tagore hospital is the flagship unit. Hooghly, East Midnapore and South 24-Parganas are among the districts from where Covid patients are coming to the Mukundapur hospital. At Peerless Hospital, none of the 11 patients from districts has received a single dose of a Covid vaccine, said Sudipta Mitra, the chief executive. The patients are from East Midnapore, Bankura, Nadia and South 24-Parganas. Officials of several hospitals said the flow of patients from districts was the reason why the total patient count was not declining over the past few weeks. “Since July, more Covid patients from districts have been coming to our hospital than patients from the city. Over the last couple of weeks, the share of the patients from Calcutta has gone down even more. But that has been made up by a further increase in the number of patients from districts,” Mitra said. Public health experts stressed the need to step up the vaccination drive in the districts. “The drive should be expedited in the districts to prevent a possible third wave. The population density in urban areas is higher and so chances of spread of Covid are high there. But the districts should not be ignored either,” said public health expert Abhijit Chowdhury. “The Centre has to send more vaccines to Bengal. Otherwise, it is impossible to keep the balance between the urban and rural vaccination programmes.” Health department officials said they had asked north Bengal districts to intensify vaccination and testing. “We are keeping a close watch on the numbers of new Covid cases. There has been an increase in numbers in north Bengal districts. So, we have asked them to inten-sify the vaccination programme,” said a health department official.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-14
19-08-2021||Business||Tata Steel to pay workers across all plants record bonus for 2020-21||Tata Steel will pay its workers across all its plants a record bonus for 2020-21 on the back of bumper profits in the last financial year. The company’s management and the Tata Workers’ Union (TWU) on Wednesday signed a memorandum of settlement for the payment of Rs 270.28 crore as annual bonus for the fiscal, which is around Rs 35 crore more than the payout of Rs 235.54 crore in 2019-20. Tata Steel had reported a net profit of Rs 13,707 crore in the last fiscal against Rs 6,744 crore a year ago, an increase of more than 100 per cent. The agreement — done much earlier than the usual payments during the Pujas — was signed between Tata Steel CEO and managing director T.V. Narendran and Tata Workers Union president Sanjeev K. Choudhary. Besides net profit, the bonus was determined by the company’s profitability and the productivity of the employees. “The union and the management have mutually agreed to continue the existing annual bonus scheme applicable for financial year 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 to be followed for financial year 2020-21 also and to pay annual bonus based on 1.5 per cent of net profit,” a union member said. “In addition the amount was  based on performance achievement on profitability (profit per tonne of saleable steel), productivity (tonnes of crude steel per employee per year) and the amount calculated was Rs 270.28 crore,” the member said. The total number of employees to whom the bonus will be paid in Jamshedpur is 12,558, which includes employees of the tubes division. “Since a majority of Tata Steel employees draw salary/wages higher than the limit laid down in the Payment of Bonus (Amendment) Act, 2015, they are not eligible for bonus under the Act. However, respecting old traditions, the company pays a bonus to all employees in the unionised category,” said a company official associated with the bonus agreement process. The official statement of the company said that despite a “difficult year”, the company has kept its “three-year commitment” made earlier, of paying the complete bonus to the employees. The average bonus amount this year is Rs 1.26 lakh, with a maximum of Rs 3.59 lakh for the old grade of employees. In the new grade, the maximum amount at actual attendance is Rs 92,910. The minimum bonus at full attendance is Rs 34,290.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-102

The final closure for the five-year perpetual bond sale is yet to happen and will be announced later, they said, adding the issue has attracted an overwhelming response. This is the biggest AT1 bond issue ever, and the first since the Yes Bank case where over Rs 8,400 crore of outstanding debt got written off during the time of the troubled lender’s bailout in March 2020. The episode had led to concerns over the efficacy of the instrument. The last fundraising through the route was by SBI in 2016, when the largest lender mopped up $300 million. Against an initial guidance of 4.125 per cent, the bank has been able to get a final pricing of 3.7 per cent, the arrangers said. Major investors who have subscribed to the issue include Fidelity, BlackRock and Singapore’s GIC. The overall order book stands at $4 billion as of now, they said, adding there is good possibility of the lender mopping-up the entire targeted amount. G-SAP plan The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday said it will conduct an open market purchase of government securities of Rs 25,000 crore on August 26, under the G-sec Acquisition Programme (G-SAP 2.0). Earlier this month, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had said the RBI’s secondary market G-sec Acquisition Programme (G-SAP) has been successful in anchoring yield expectations while eliciting keen response from market participants.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-102
19-08-2021||Business|| Reserve Bank of India comes out with revised guidelines for hiring of lockers||The Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday came out with revised guidelines for the hiring of lockers under which the liability of banks will be limited to 100 times its annual rent in the case of fire, theft, building collapse or frauds by bank employees. According to the revised guidelines, which shall come into effect from January 1, 2022, banks will be required to incorporate a clause in the locker agreement prohibiting the hirer from keeping anything illegal or hazardous in lockers. The revised instructions will be applicable to both new and existing safe deposit lockers and the safe custody of articles facility with the banks. Banks need to maintain a branch-wise list of vacant lockers as well as a wait-list to ensure transparency in the allotment of lockers. Banks shall provide a wait list number to the customers, if the lockers are not available for allotment. The RBI has also detailed the compensation policy and liability of banks in the revised instructions. “The bank shall not be liable for any damage and/or loss of contents of locker arising from natural calamities or Acts of God like earthquake, floods, lightning and thunderstorm or any act that is attributable to the sole fault or negligence of the customer,” it said. “As banks cannot claim that they bear no liability towards their customers for loss of contents of the locker, in instances where loss of contents of locker are due to incidents (like fire, theft/ burglary/ robbery, dacoity) or attributable to fraud committed by its employee(s), the banks’ liability shall be for an amount equivalent to one hundred times the prevailing annual rent of the safe deposit locker,” it said. On locker rent, the RBI said that to ensure prompt payment of locker rent, banks are allowed to obtain a Term Deposit, at the time of allotment, which would cover three years’ rent and the charges for breaking open the locker in case of such an eventuality.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-102

Controversy within the government erupted over a fairly innocuous report that credit rating agency Icra put out in March that projected the discom losses at Rs 90,000 crore. The ministry did not react to the Icra forecast until the Niti Aayog released a report on discoms, co-authored with energy think tank RMI, about a fortnight back which used the rating agency’s figures to buttress its argument that “most discoms incur vast losses every year, and the situation is only getting worse with every passing day”. “A financial and operational turnaround of the discoms is urgent,” said the Niti Aayog report, adding “most power distribution companies ... incur losses every year —the total loss is estimated to be Rs 90,000 crore in FY 2021”. In his preface to the report, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant wrote: “The distribution sector has been the Achilles’ heel of the power sector, consistently making large losses... We will not be able to achieve a high-growth, low-carbon economy unless the distribution sector achieves profitability.” That is when the power ministry saw red. In a detailed rebuttal on Wednesday, the ministry tore into the Icra projections saying that the discom losses had been “grossly inflated” and built on “flawed” assumptions. Interestingly, the power ministry turned its guns against Icra — which made the projection based on information available at that time — and not the Niti Aayog whose report picked on that estimate to build a wider argument for reforms in the power sector. When contacted, ministry officials declined to comment on the issue saying the statement speaks for itself. Picking holes The ministry note slams the Icra report for drawing untenable conclusions based on the decline in electricity volume sales in 2020-21 due to the Covid-19-induced lockdown. It also pours scorn on Icra’s projection that discom dues to creditors between March and December 2020 had increased by Rs 30,000 crore. The ministry said this was a flawed assumption and based on premise that an increase in payables — attributable to a cash flow problem — would directly lead to a rise in discom losses. The note also said that the Icra estimate of Rs 60,000 crore losses at discoms in 2019-20 was equally flawed and was actually half that figure. “As a result of the erroneous projections by Icra, the loss figures of Rs 90,000 crore for FY2021 seem to be grossly inflated,” the ministry said. The ministry also blamed the media for reporting the inflated discom loss figures, glossing over the fact that these had been made based on the Niti Aayog report. The ministry note said that the electricity tariff regulatory system had a mechanism that “would allow the recoveries of losses arising due to change in consumer category-wise consumption patterns coming with Covid induced lockdowns”. It added that these losses would be recovered through tariffs “in the subsequent year”. The ministry said Icra had alluded to this aspect in its report but such a “nuanced position” had not been reflected in the media reports. Tariff hikes loom The ministry’s statement now opens its own can of worms with the prospect of looming electricity tariff hikes. Late tonight, Icra said its March report “does not anywhere say that the book losses for FY2021 are estimated at Rs. 90,000 crore. The agency said it estimated net losses at PBT/PAT levels for FY2020 at about Rs. 56,000 crore. The rating agency admitted that the discom losses might be lower depending on how much of the revenue losses the state electricity regulatory commissions (SERCs) allowed the discoms to claim “as a basis for future revenue and tariff determination under the cost-plus tariff principles” . Any compensation granted by state governments by way of additional revenue support would also help them book lower losses, it added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-102

Snapping its four-session record-setting spree, the 30-share benchmark closed 162.78 points, or 0.29 per cent, lower at 55629.49. It touched an all-time peak of 56118.57 during the session. Similarly, breaking its seven-day winning streak, the broader NSE Nifty declined 45.75 points, or 0.28 per cent, to 16568.85. It touched a record intra-day peak of 16701.85. “Succumbing to profit-booking, the Indian market gave away its gains. Bleeding banking, realty and metal stocks dragged while midcaps provided some relief but the broad trend was weak. “European markets traded cautiously as Eurozone inflation accelerated to 2.2 per cent in July, beating ECB estimates of 2 per cent owing to a spike in energy prices. “The markets are awaiting the US Fed meeting minutes to provide some direction on future policy, which is expected to showcase its current accommodative policy in line with the latest policy statement,” said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services. Shrikant Chouhan, executive vice-president, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities, said: “The market had been rallying sharply over the past few sessions and hence investors booked some profit today, but not before key benchmark indices hit fresh record highs in early trade. In the near future, the Nifty may consolidate between 16420 to 16700 levels.” Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst, HDFC Securities, said: The market seems to have started tiring at the new highs of 16700. But, there is no indication of any reversal pattern unfolding at the higher levels.” S. Hariharan, head-sales trading, Emkay Global Financial Services, said: “The Nifty has out-performed Asian and EM peers over the last week, with a strong trend in passive foreign flows, as foreign funds have aimed to re-allocate weights from China towards India. “Launches of domestic MF schemes have brought in fresh inflows of Rs 8,000 crore. Banks remain the predominant under-performing sector while IT has been an out-performer.” Domestic benchmark indices, after witnessing record highs, gave up all gains as selling pressure in heavyweight financials, especially private banks, dragged the market, said Binod Modi, head - strategy at Reliance Securities.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-102

19-08-2021||India||Jaishankar slams China over stand on terrorism at UNSC meet||In a swipe at China, India told the UN Security Council on Thursday that countries should not place "blocks and holds" without any reason on requests to designate terrorists, warning that any double standards and distinctions between terrorists would be made only at "our own peril". "The international community holds a collective view that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations must be condemned. There cannot be any exception or justification for any act of terrorism, regardless of motivations behind such acts, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the UN Security Council. Jaishankar, President of the UN Security Council, chaired the UNSC Briefing on Threats to International Peace and Security Caused by Terrorist Acts held under India's Presidency of the Council. Speaking in his national capacity, Jaishankar alluded to his remarks to the Council made in January this year when he had proposed an eight-point action plan aimed at collectively eliminating the scourge of terrorism. "Summon the political will: don't justify terrorism, don't glorify terrorists; No double standards. Terrorists are terrorists; distinctions are made only at our own peril; Don't place blocks and holds on listing requests without any reason," he said. This was in reference to China, a permanent member of the UNSC, repeatedly placing technical holds on bids by India and other nations to designate head of Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed Masood Azhar. The United Nations designated Azhar as a global terrorist in 2019 after China lifted its hold on a proposal to blacklist him under the Security Council's Sanctions Committee, slapping an arms embargo, asset freeze and travel ban on him, 10 years after India first moved to have him blacklisted at the UN. Jaishankar also called for discouraging exclusivist thinking" and urged member nations to be on guard against new terminologies and false priorities. He stressed that enlisting and delisting should be done objectively, and not on political or religious considerations. The international community should also recognise the linkage to organised crime, support and strengthen the FATF, and and provide greater funding to UN Office of Counter Terrorism. "I call on this Council to collectively build on these principles. It is also important therefore to end the stalemate preventing the adoption of a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, which India has championed for so long, he said. Asserting that there cannot be any exception or justification for any act of terrorism, regardless of motivations behind such acts, Jaishankar said, we also recognise that the menace of terrorism cannot be and should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilisation or ethnic group. However, in spite of the progress made to tighten the legal, security, financing and other frameworks to combat terrorism, terrorists are constantly finding newer ways of motivating, resourcing and executing acts of terror, he noted. "Unfortunately, there are also some countries who seek to undermine or subvert our collective resolve to fight terrorism. This cannot be allowed to pass," he said. On Pakistan-backed terror Pakistan-based terror groups like LeT and JeM continue to operate with both impunity and encouragement, India further said at the meet, calling on it not to take a "selective view" on the scourge of terrorism and to have the courage to call out the "double speak" of those who extend state hospitality to individuals who have innocents' blood on their hands. Jaishankar said the heightened activities of the proscribed Haqqani Network justifies this growing anxiety. "In our own immediate neighbourhood, ISIL-Khorasan (ISIL-K) has become more energetic and is constantly seeking to expand its footprint. Events unfolding in Afghanistan have naturally enhanced global concerns about their implications for both regional and international security," he said. "Whether it is in Afghanistan or against India, groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) continue to operate with both impunity and encouragement," Jaishankar said. "It is therefore vital that the Security Council does not take a selective, tactical or complacent view of the problems we face," the External Affairs Minister said. "We must never countenance sanctuaries for terrorists or overlook their raising of resources," he said. Without naming Pakistan, where proscribed UN terrorists and terror groups enjoy safe havens and state support, Jaishankar said, "When we see state hospitality being extended to those with innocents' blood on their hands, we should never lack the courage to call out their double-speak." He also drew parallels between the Covid-19 pandemic and the scourge of terrorism, telling the powerful 15-nation UN body that let us always remember that what is true of Covid is even more true of terrorism: none of us are safe until all of us are safe.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-297

Now that the Shiv Sena has snapped ties with the BJP and formed a government with the Congress and the NCP, the BJP has a golden opportunity to further expand its mass base in the state, the Leader of Opposition in the assembly said. He was speaking here after Shiv Sena leader from Pune district Asha Buchake joined the BJP in the presence of the party's state unit president, Chandrakant Patil. Fadnavis said, “The BJP could not expand earlier in the state because we were in an alliance (with the Shiv Sena). Now, three parties are in power and the BJP has a golden opportunity to expand itself at the state-level. The BJP will form its own government in the next assembly elections (due in 2024).” "All the three parties that are in power are feeling suffocated now. It is a welcome move that Asha Buchake, who is from a party in the ruling coalition, is joining the BJP," he said. The BJP and the Shiv Sena first entered into an alliance in the late 1980s at Maharashtra and national levels. The saffron alliance was temporarily broken in 2014 when both parties fought the assembly elections that year separately. In late 2014, the Shiv Sena joined the BJP government formed under the leadership of Fadnavis and both parties fought the 2019 assembly polls together. However, in November 2019, the Shiv Sena walked out of the alliance with the BJP over differences on sharing power, and joined hands with the Congress and the NCP to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi government.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-297

He said he had prepared for the exam thoroughly and would pass with cent per cent marks. "I had appeared in the Class 10 examination two years ago while I was in the Tihar Jail. However, I did not appear in the English paper. The education board gave me a compartment in the subject, so I wrote the paper now," Chautala said after appearing in the exam at the Arya Kanya Senior Secondary School on Arya Samaj Road in Sirsa on Wednesday. The former chief minister said even though he could not get much education when he was young, he used to listen to English words with attention and then write those. "That is how I got hold of the subject," he said. A court in Rohini had convicted Chautala in the junior basic teachers recruitment case in Haryana and sentenced him to 10 years of imprisonment. The INLD leader was lodged in Delhi's Tihar Jail from January 2013 to July this year. "During my prison term, I decided to work on my educational qualification," Chautala said. The Haryana education board withheld Chautala's Class 12 results on August 5 as he had not cleared the Class 10 English paper. A class 10 student of the Sirsa school, Malkiat Kaur, assisted Chautala as a writer for the paper. "He was well prepared, his pronunciation was very good and his marks are expected to be good in this subject," she said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-297

He also said that Australia has shown significant interest to do an early harvest pact with India and exporters should share areas of their interest with the ministry. An early harvest with countries like Australia will help India engage with others on similar lines, Goyal said. "The US as of now has kind of indicated that they are not looking for new trade agreements, but we look at working with them for more market access issues on both the sides and I think that would also be a big relief and a big opportunity opener for our export sector," he said while addressing the Export Promotion Council leaders in Mumbai. On the proposed free trade pact with the UK, the minister said it is progressing well as both the teams are in talks. "We are working with line ministries on areas where we can quickly close the deal in terms of an early harvest if possible, so instead of trying to address 11,000 lines (or products), we can look at areas of their immediate interest and our immediate interest," Goyal said. On the comprehensive trade pact with the European Union, he said discussions have started as the EU is a 27-nation bloc, an agreement with them is a much longer process. "We will work very hard to speed it up," he added. The minister also assured the industry that India will not allow the "same mistakes" that were made in the past FTAs and is trying to allow an interactive approach this time. "We are engaging with all of you and industry to ensure that FTAs are fairly and equitably crafted, bringing in more elements of reciprocity. But FTA cannot be a one way traffic. We also have to open our markets to others if we are wanting a larger pie in their markets, and therefore my appeal and request to all is to also identify areas where we have the confidence that we can withstand competition," he said. He expressed hope for "an early win" with Australia. India has also started talks for a pact with Bangladesh. "Our effort is to ensure that we focus on countries where we have significant potential and more with the developed world where we can compete better and where market size is of considerable value," the minister said. He also urged export promotion councils to study FTAs and see whether there are "hidden" opportunities in them as it will help India set significantly higher export targets for 2022-23. He informed that exports are doing good and it has increased by 55 per cent to USD 15 billion during the first two weeks of August. Further, he said that two areas where significant opportunities for investment exist are shipping and semi-conductors. On interest equalisation, he said it is at an advanced stage of finalisation within the government and "we hope that very soon we will be able to push out a cabinet note on that". On Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme, he said steel, pharma, and chemicals sectors are not covered due to a lack of adequate budget. "But we have an open mind to consider concerns and rectify mistakes that might have crept in if anyone feels it is detrimental to their industry," he added. He also informed the exporters that the ministry is setting up two separate divisions which will focus entirely on the services sector. The minister said a policy would be announced for Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone (SEEPZ), besides Rs 50 crore would be used to set up a common service centre there and roughly Rs 200 crore for refurbishing or rebuilding so that SEEPZ can become a role model of truly world class export promotion area. In the meeting, Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) Chairman Colin Shah raised the issue of announcement of ecommerce policy for the sector. On this, Goyal said it is at an advanced stage and "we will finalise it shortly with the finance ministry". The minister asked the export community to also target USD 2 trillion exports by the year 2030, comprising USD 1 trillion merchandise exports and USD 1 trillion services exports.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-297
19-08-2021||India||Covid: India prepares for third wave with focus on children||Several Indian states are building facilities with more paediatric beds, plus oxygen, due to concern that children returning to school without being vaccinated will be among the most vulnerable during a third wave of coronavirus infections. Health administrators have taken heed of trends in the United States, where a record number of children have been hospitalised as the coronavirus Delta variant, first found in India, has surged through unvaccinated populations. read more During a second wave of infections in India that peaked in April and May, hundreds of thousands of people died for want of oxygen and medical facilities, and now there are concerns that another third wave will gather during the winter months. "We don't know how the virus will behave, but we cannot afford to be unprepared this time around," Suhas Prabhu, who heads the Paediatric Task Force in the big western state of Maharashtra, said. "No mother should have to run around looking for a hospital bed when her child is sick." The Maharashtra government has stockpiled medicines, and built facilities for additional pediatric beds and oxygen provisions in new centres in Mumbai and Aurangabad. Built on empty stretches of land or in re-purposed stadiums, the Mumbai facilities have a total of 1,500 pediatric beds, most of them with oxygen. "We can upgrade this capacity to double if needed," Suresh Kakani, a senior official with Mumbai's civic body said. In neighbouring Gujarat, authorities have set up 15,000 pediatric oxygen beds, health commissioner Jai Prakash Shivahare said. India provides vaccines to people above the age 18. Most vaccines administered in India are made by AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), while shots produced by local manufacturer Bharat Biotech are also being used. Another local firm Zydus Cadilla and Bharat Biotech are separately testing vaccines for children but the results are not expected until the year end. Meantime, schools in at least 11 of India's 28 states have opened after more than a year of closures, raising worries these could become breeding grounds for transmission of the virus. As of March 2021, less than 1 pct of India's coronavirus deaths were in the under 15 age group, according to the health ministry, and officials say the severity of the disease in this age group has been minimal so far. Epidemiologists say there is no evidence to show that the Delta variant or any other mutations affect children more than other parts of the population.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-298
19-08-2021||India||‘Improvement’ needed in new farm laws, says  RSS-backed BKS||The RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) on Thursday said the outfit will stage a nationwide agitation on September 8 to press for 'remunerative price' to farmers for their produce to cover their production cost and called for "improvement" in the Centre's new agri laws that are facing opposition from a section of cultivators. The farmer body said the Central government should either bring a new legislation or make changes in the agri-marketing laws enacted last year to add a provision for payment of minimum support price (MSP) for major farm produce. Top BKS functionary Dinesh Kulkarni, addressing a press conference here, said farmers should get 'remunerative price' for their produce to cover their cost of production, which they are not getting in the existing system. "Remunerative price is cost of production plus profit - that is what we demanding. Remunerative price is the right of farmers, which should be facilitated by the government," said Kulkarni, the BKS's Akhil Bharatiya Sanghatan Mantri (national organising general secretary). "The MSP announced by the government today is not a remunerative price. However, even if it is not doing that it should at least give the MSP it is announcing and make a law for the same," he said. Kulkarni said the three new farm laws do not have any clause about ensuring MSP or remunerative price for agricultural commodities. "The government should ensure this remunerative price in the present farm laws or make a separate legislation for the same. The government should make guidelines in respect of contract farming wherein crops are not purchased below MSP. This should be at least implemented for the 23 crops that are currently under the MSP regime," he said. Asked about his views on the Centre's new agri-marketing laws, against which farmers are protesting for the last ten months, Kulkarni told PTI that they need "some improvement". "For example, there should be an agriculture court (to tackle disputes). Similarly, (private) traders coming into the farm sector should be registered and should give bank security. Thirdly, there is a huge flaw in respect to (changes) in the Essential Commodities Act as far as consumers are concerned," he said. The government, in order to promote business, has given huge exemption to big companies, allowing them to stock some commodities as much as they want and this needs to corrected, the BKS leader said. The 2020 amendment to the Essential Commodities Act, which is part of the new agri laws, removes restrictions on stocking of certain essential commodities. To a query on the BKS's view on the ongoing farmer protest, Kulkarni said the nature of the agitation changed after January 26, when the stir took a violent turn in New Delhi. After that dialogue with the Centre stopped, he said. The government and farmer unions have held 11 rounds of talks so far, the last being on January 22, to break the deadlock on the new laws and end the protest. "It (talks) would have paved the way for discussion with the system for implementing remunerative price in the right manner. However, that dialogue stopped," Kulkarni said. The three farm laws enacted in September 2020 have been projected by the Modi government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain in place.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-298

The order passed in relation to district courts stated that: In partial modification of this Court's Office Order dated 12.08.2021 the Hon'ble Full Court has been pleased to order that physical hearings in the District Courts in Delhi shall resume in a graded manner with effect from 24.08.2021. Wherever possible, hybrid/video conferencing hearing may be permitted when a request to such effect is made by any of the parties and/or their counsel on physical hearing days, it added. The earlier direction issued by this Court dated 08.04.2021 that no adverse orders shall be passed by the District Courts in Delhi in case of non-appearance of parties and/ or their counsel stands withdrawn w.e.f. 24.08.2021, the order further said. The Principal District & Sessions Judges and Principal Judge, Family Court (HQs) have been directed by the high court to prepare the roster of judicial officers in such a manner that every judicial officer holds physical court on alternate days while the others continue to hold courts through video-conferencing, as per the existing arrangement.

The necessary arrangements for the production of undertrials shall be made in coordination with Prison and Lock-up authorities, it added. On July 22, the high court had said that it might resume physical functioning on experimental basis from August 16. In its August 12 order, the high court had said that resumption of physical hearing was subject to the scale and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic remaining under control. On April 18, the high court had said that from April 19 onwards it would only take up "extremely urgent matters" filed this year. Similar orders were issued on April 23 and May 15. Prior to that, on April 8, it had decided that from April 9 to April 23 it would take up matters "through virtual mode only" in view of the rise in COVID-19 cases. The high court had commenced complete physical functioning from March 15 onwards. Subsequently, it had said that virtual or hybrid proceedings would be held on the request of lawyers. Following the outbreak of COVID-19 in March last year, the court was holding proceedings through video conference. Its functioning was restricted to urgent matters from March 16 last year. Thereafter, from March 25 last year, the functioning of the high court and district courts was further restricted and no physical hearing was being conducted due to the spread of COVID-19. Subsequently, from September last year a few benches started holding physical courts everyday on a rotation basis. Some of them also started holding hybrid proceedings, wherein lawyers have the option to attend the hearing via video conference instead of appearing in person.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-298
19-08-2021||India||Will appear before ED after completion of legal process, says Deshmukh||Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Thursday said he will appear before the ED, which had summoned him in connection with its probe into a money laundering case, "after the legal process is completed". Deshmukh in a statement claimed the "Supreme Court has accepted his plea on the ED and it will be heard soon". The SC on Monday refused to grant interim relief to NCP leader Deshmukh, who was seeking protection from any coercive action in connection with the money laundering case lodged by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). A three-judge bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar, while hearing a batch of pleas including those challenging the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), said Desmukh is at liberty to access remedies available to him under the law. Deshmukh in his statement said the apex court on Monday allowed him to move a lower court as well for lawful remedies under the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code). "The legal process has begun and I will appear before the ED after the legal process is completed. I will cooperate with the ED. I have always followed high standards in my entire social-political life," he said. The ED had earlier issued summons to Deshmukh in connection with a criminal case registered under the PMLA related to an alleged Rs 100 crore bribery-cum-extortion racket that led to the the 71-year-old NCP leader's resignation in April this year. Deshmukh skipped appearing before the ED for the firth time on Wednesday and had stated that he was taking recourse to "lawful remedies" for the protection of his liberty. He had a three-page reply to the investigating officer of the case through his lawyer, saying the Supreme Court has "made it open for me to take recourse to all appropriate remedies available under CrPC including filing of a quashing petition". The NCP leader had said he was taking recourse to legal remedies for the protection of his liberty "within a day or two". Deshmukh had also said he was a "law abiding citizen" as he requested the agency to record his statement through an electronic medium, till the time "appropriate orders are passed by court(s)" The ED's case against Deshmukh and others was registered after the CBI had lodged a corruption case related to allegations of at least Rs 100 crore bribery made by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. In his letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray after he was removed from the police commissioner's post, Singh had alleged that Deshmukh asked suspended Mumbai police assistant police inspector Sachin Waze to extort over Rs 100 crore a month from bars and restaurants in the city. Deshmukh, who resigned from his post in April following the allegations, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The ED had arrested Deshmukh's personal secretary and personal assistant after it carried out raids against them and the NCP leader in Mumbai and Nagpur.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-298
19-08-2021||India||Modi's popularity has plummeted, indicate two major surveys||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Teflon’ coating may be wearing thin, mainly due to his handling of the catastrophic second pandemic wave. Modi’s standing with the public has cratered, according to two major surveys by leading publications. Just 24 per cent said Modi was best suited to be prime minister, according to India Today’s six-monthly Mood of the Nation Survey. Modi’s popularity has crashed in this survey from 66 per cent one year ago and 38 per cent in January 2020. Similarly, 46 per cent feel there’s a need for new political leadership at the Centre, according to the latest YouGov-Mint—CPR Millennial Survey. Another 53 per cent of people surveyed agreed with the statement: “The people I interact with are very upset with PM Modi’s leadership in the past few months.” Another 42 per cent said that: “PM Modi is responsible for the healthcare disaster that followed the second wave of the pandemic.” But in what may come as partial consolation for the BJP in the YouGov survey is that 48 per cent said that Modi’s efforts can’t be faulted at all for the Covid catastrophe. Roughly half the respondents in the YouGov-Mint survey were millennials (25-40), the rest were pre-millennials (40+) or post-millennials (aged 18-24). Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath came in second as the person best suited to be prime minister -- 11 per cent of those surveyed wanted him for the job, according to the MOTN survey. Adityananath was followed closely by Rahul Gandhi at 10 per cent and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal at 8 per cent. Home Minister Amit Shah, regarded as Modi’s closest ally in government, came in with 7 per cent viewing him as best suited to be prime minister. Sonia Gandhi got 4 per cent. Adityanath is the most improved in this category because in August 2020 just 3 per cent saw him as the right man to be prime minister.  India Today’s survey was conducted across 10 days in July and covered 19 states, 115 parliamentary and 230 assembly constituencies. The pollsters conducted 14,559 interviews. Of those surveyed, 71 per cent of the people lived in rural areas and 29 per cent were urban-dwellers. The YouGov-Mint survey contacted 10,285 people online across 203 cities during June and July. The survey found that support for the BJP had remained steady at 44 per cent from a year ago. The survey notes its limits -- that its findings are restricted to relatively affluent urban netizens and excludes the rural population that suffered badly in the second wave so those voters’ assessment of the government’s performance may differ. On government policies, 29 per cent of those canvassed by India Today said the government’s biggest achievement was getting a favourable verdict on the Ram Temple in the Supreme Court and 22 per cent gave it high marks for the revocation of Article 370. In negative news for the Government, 29 per cent said its biggest failures were price rises and inflation and another 23 per cent singled out unemployment. Just 12 per cent felt the government had handled the Covid-19 pandemic well but only 11 per cent gave it a decisive thumbs-down for its pandemic handling. Crucially, people who felt that Modi’s performance as prime minister was outstanding slid from 30 per cent in January 2021 to just 16 per cent in August 2021 in the India Today survey. People who felt he had put in an average performance rose from 17 per cent in January 2021 to 30 per cent by August. Another 6 per cent felt he had performed poorly in January and that rose to 11 per cent by August. Interestingly, the percentage of people in the India Today survey who said they would vote for the BJP has fallen steadily since the May 2019 election and the sharpest fall came between August 2019 and January 2020 even before the pandemic. In August 2019, the survey reckoned the BJP had 45 per cent of the vote and would win 357 seats. That fell to around 42 per cent and 303 seats in January 2020 and to 40 per cent and 298 seats in the latest survey. The crucial figure to remember here is that a party needs 273 seats to hold an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha. The government’s handling of the pandemic seems to be the biggest complaint of voters. Modi got a 73 per cent approval rating in January 2021 for his handling of the first wave, that number dropped to 49 per cent after the second wave. The government recently denied that there have been any deaths “due to lack of oxygen,” despite widespread media coverage of oxygen shortages across the country. And few survey respondents seem to believe the Covid fatality numbers put out by the government. As many as 71 per cent said that Covid-19 had infected and caused more deaths in the country than the 433,000 reported by the government. (Many experts, employing research models and local official data, put the pandemic death toll in the three-to-four million range. Some estimates calculate the death toll at a massive five million). But in what may be some consolation to the BJP, 44 per cent of survey participants attributed the health crisis to both the central and state governments’ actions. While all these numbers are gloomy tidings for the government now, the next general elections aren’t till 2024 so Modi still has time to turn his popularity around.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-298
19-08-2021||India||Over 3.86 crore people missed their second dose, reveals govt||Over 3.86 crore people did not get their second dose of anti-Covid vaccines -- Covishield and Covaxin -- within the stipulated period of time, the government has said in response to an RTI query. According to information on the CoWIN portal, as of Thursday afternoon 44,22,85,854 people have received their first dose, while 12,59,07,443 have also taken their second. Activist Raman Sharma had filed a query under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, seeking to know from the government the number of people who had received the first dose of vaccines -- Covishield and Covaxin but did not take the second within the stipulated time period. In response to the query, the Covid-19 Vaccine Administration Cell of the Union Health Ministry said it is recommended the second dose of Covishield be taken within 84-112 days after the first, while in case of Covaxin the gap should between 28-42 days. "The total number of vaccinees (beneficiaries) who got their first dose of Covishield Vaccine but did not get their second dose within stipulated period of time as prescribed by the Govt of India as per the Due Report of Co-WIN portal is 3,40,72,993 (data as on 17th August 2021)," the response said. It further said the total number of beneficiaries who got their first dose of Covaxin but did not get their second within the stipulated period of time as prescribed by the government as per the due report of in Co-WIN portal is 46,78,406 (data as on 17th August 2021). "It is recommended that vaccinees who got their first dose of vaccine get their second dose in the stipulated period. There is no recommendation for such vaccinees who got their first dose of COVID Vaccine but did not get the second dose within the stipulated period as prescribed by Government of India to get their first dose again," it said. In the Frequently Asked Questions sections on the website, the government recommends that "both doses of vaccine should be taken for realising the full benefit of vaccination". "Both doses must be of the same vaccine type," it says.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-298
19-08-2021||India||India should be ‘open-minded’ about dealing with the Taliban: Yashwant Sinha||Former external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha on Tuesday said India should be "open-minded" about dealing with the Taliban and suggested that it should open its embassy in Kabul and send back the ambassador. Noting that the people of Afghanistan have great love for India while Pakistan is not popular among them, Sinha told PTI in an interview that the Indian government should not conclude that the Taliban will place itself "in Pakistan's lap" as every country furthers its own interests. As a big country, India should approach the issues of the Taliban with a degree of confidence and should not indulge in a "widow's wail" as if Pakistan has taken over Afghanistan or has an advantage over it, he added. That the Taliban now controls most of Afghanistan is a reality, Sinha said, adding that India should adopt "wait and watch" mode and be in no hurry either to recognise or to dismiss its regime. The Taliban swept across Afghanistan this month, seizing control of almost all key Afghan towns and cities in the country following the withdrawal of the US forces from the country. Kabul also fell to the Taliban on Sunday after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani left the country for an unknown destination. "It appears on the face of it that the Taliban of 2021 is not the same Taliban of 2001. There appears to be some difference. They are making mature statements. That is something we have to take note of," Sinha said. "I am not saying that take their statements at face value but I will also suggest that they should not be dismissed off-hand because of their past behaviour. We have to look at present and future," he added. Sinha was the foreign minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government but became a critic of the Modi government and quit the BJP. He is currently vice president in the Trinamool Congress. He said India should have waited instead of immediately closing its embassy and evacuating its people after the extremist Islamist organisation captured Kabul. India on Tuesday rushed back home its ambassador Rudrendra Tandon and staff from the embassy in Kabul in a military transport aircraft following escalating tension, fear and uncertainty gripping the Afghan capital after the Taliban insurgents seized the Afghan capital on Sunday. This policy needs to have a second look, Sinha said, noting that the Taliban is holding talks with former Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai, who took office after the US-led forces had toppled the previous Taliban regime after the 9/11 terror attack, and its former CEO Abdullah Abdullah. It could not have been imagined earlier, Sinha said. He added, "India should immediately open its embassy in Kabul and send back the ambassador." "We must remember that the people of Afghanistan have great love for India. Pakistan is not popular with the people of Afghanistan, India is. That we must remember. Our development works have also been appreciated," he said. Organisations dubbed as terror groups have occupied the highest offices in the past and have changed, he noted, saying that India should wait to see how the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan pans out. To dismiss always is to turn your face from reality, he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-298
19-08-2021||India||We feel like prisoners on our Independence Day, says former Afghan journalist||Cooped up inside his Kabul home with his family since the Taliban took over the capital city, Akhtarabir Akhtar, who eagerly waits to celebrate August 19 to mark the Independence Day of his beloved Afghanistan, says instead of festivities, fear and an uneasy calm rule the streets. Akhtar, a former journalist, is not a stranger to the fear of being targeted, but the chain of events in the past few days has given him sleepless nights. "August 19 is our Independence Day and we celebrate this occasion every year with feast and much gaiety. People decorate their homes and plant country flags, make merry, go to decked-up bazaars, wear colourful national clothes and do the national dance 'Attan'. All of that is missing today," the 54-year-old told PTI over phone from Kabul. While phone lines and internet are working in Afghanistan, the network connection is wobbly and his voice sometimes quivered as he bared his sentiments on the situation in his homeland. "Afghans celebrate August 19, but the government has fallen, what to talk of freedom. People are locked up inside their homes from Kabul to Kandahar and are afraid to step out as the Taliban men are marching in the streets. We all feel like prisoners on our anniversary day of 'azadi'," he said. Prices of food and other commodities have "shot up as borders are practically sealed", he said. Akhtar, who works as a government official, lives in Kabul with his wife and two daughters aged 27 and 18, while his elder son works in Germany and the younger one is studying at a university in Beijing. "My wife is a midwife at a private hospital. She is scared to go to work now. My elder daughter who worked in a bank earlier is feeling uncertain and my younger daughter who was dreaming of going to a college and pursue higher studies, is now wondering if she will be even allowed to study by the Taliban and live freely," he rued. A despondent Akhtar, who has not gone to office since the Taliban intensified its offensive early this month, lamented that "Afganistan has descended into an abyss of uncertainty". "No one wants to live here anymore as they fear for their lives. Some of my relatives and friends had also rushed to the Kabul airport to seek a flight out of the capital city the day it had fallen to the Taliban, but they couldn't escape, so returned to their homes," he said. The story of the Akhtar family finds echoes in tens of thousands of households across Afghanistan, which had achieved Independence way back in 1919, overthrowing the British colonial yoke, with Amanullah Khan being its first sovereign ruler, a revered figure among the Afghans. However, the civil wars in later decades had fractured the peaceful and progressive atmosphere that once existed in Afghanistan. The Taliban swept across the country this month, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities in the backdrop of withdrawal of the US forces that began on May 1. The insurgent forces has now sought to portray themselves as more moderate than when they had imposed a brutal rule in the late 1990s. But many Afghans remain sceptical of this and fear return of "regressive" regime. Akhtar says he loves Afghanistan and is emotionally attached to his motherland, but given the current situation, if an opportunity comes up, "I will move out of country with my family, preferably to India, which is like my second home". The former journalist from Kabul, recalled his visit to India in 2011-12 when had come to Delhi for a mid-career course and become an admirer of India and its culture. "I have fond memories of my India visit and besides academics, we had also gone to see the Taj Mahal and other places. The food and the culture of India are very colourful like we have in Afghanistan. We are good friends and it breaks my heart that Kabul had fallen to Taliban on August 15, the day India marked its 75th Independence Day," Akhtar said, with a tone of sadness in his voice. He recalled his visit 10 years ago to south Delhi's Lajpat Nagar -- dubbed as 'Little Kabul' -- and how he felt it was "piece of Afghanistan in India". "India and its culture and cinema always attracted me. Even I have seen the Hindi film 'Kabuliwala'. It was such a beautiful coincidence that both countries achieved liberation in the month of August, Afghanistan in 1919 and India in 1947," the Kabul resident said. In August 2019, a suicide bomb attack in Kabul had delayed the centenary Independence Day celebrations in Afghanistan and its at embassies in Delhi and elsewhere. Asked how the Independence Day is generally marked in capital Kabul, Akhtar said, "Women wear beautiful 'Gande Afghani', men wear kurta and salwar, and lot of merriment takes place at home, people eat chopan kebab, Kabuli palaw, firni, dry fruits halwa, and greet each other, visit markets to shop". "Today with Taliban at our doorsteps literally, we can't even put up our national flag. Only Allah knows, what will happen to Afghanistan now," he lamented.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-298
19-08-2021||India||Rajnath defends farm laws but says ready for talks ||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday defended the Centre's three contentious farm laws but said his government is ready to talk to farmers if they feel there is any clause in the legislations against their interests. Stressing that there is a need to fully understand the laws, Singh said an "atmosphere of opposition" is being created and farmers should understand this. Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi's borders since late November in protest against the laws, demanding their withdrawal. Farmer groups have alleged that the laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. Addressing the gathering for a state-level Annapurna programme under the Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana through online mode on Thursday, Singh lauded the Narendra Modi government for taking steps for the welfare of farmers. "Our government brought three farm laws. But I think there is a need to fully understand these laws," said Singh. "Lekin ek virodh ka mahoul bhi paida kiya ja raha hai (But an atmosphere of opposition is being created). I feel that farmer brothers should understand this," he said. "Confusion" over the minimum support price was also spread, he asserted. "Farmers have started learning the truth and they have started doing calculations of their profit and loss," Rajnath claimed while pointing to benefits of the laws. "I have studied the farm legislations fully and I can say with confidence that there is no clause as per my information which is against the interest of our farmer brothers," he said. "If anybody feels there is any such clause in these laws which can affect the interest of farmers, I want to say with full confidence that we are ready to sit and hold talks with farmer brothers," the defence minister added. Listing out the Modi government's decisions taken for farmers' welfare, he said the MSP has been raised by one-and-half times and small farmers have been provided with cheaper loans. A sum of over Rs 1.50 lakh crore has been credited to the bank accounts of farmers, he said, adding that it had never happened in the history of the country. "All these steps were taken to empower and strengthen our farmers," he said. He also talked about Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana, saying Rs 6,000 directly goes into the account of farmers. "There is no possibility of corruption. The whole money reaches your accounts," he stressed while reminding that once former PM Rajiv Gandhi had said that only 16 out of 100 paise reaches people. "We today send 100 paise and the whole amount reaches your accounts. There is no possibility of corruption. What will be more sensitivity towards farmers than this," he asked. Singh said the Centre and state governments complement each other in a cooperative federal structure. "The Centre may frame many plans but until it gets support from the state government, their successful implementation is not possible. Similarly, the state government may make many plans, if the Centre does not support them, their implementation also becomes difficult," he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-298

BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia cited the report of the National Human Rights Commission and the HC's order to say that people's complaints were not heard by the state police after violence broke out following the TMC's win in the Assembly polls and that the state government allegedly provided protection to criminals. Prima facie accused are from the Trinamul Congress, he alleged. The Calcutta High Court ordered a CBI probe into grievous cases such as murder and rape in the post-poll violence in Bengal. A five-judge bench headed by Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal also ordered the formation of a special investigation team (SIT) to probe all other offences related to the alleged post-poll violence. Bhatia said, "The high court has given a strong message. It should be a milestone as the court has made it clear that anarchy has no place in India." Calling Mamata a "failed CM", he alleged that her government did not ensure security of people and asked her to now stand with the law and discharge her constitutional obligations. The judiciary has shown that if a chief minister supports anarchist elements, then it will step in to secure people, he said. Other Opposition parties can learn from the BJP, he said, noting that the saffron party had been consistently raising the issue and its president J P Nadda had visited the victims of violence to underscore the party's commitment to justice for them.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-299
19-08-2021||India||Gujarat HC stays sections of anti-conversion law enacted in state||The Gujarat High Court on Thursday put a stay on the operation of some sections related to interfaith marriages of the state's new anti-conversion law. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Biren Vaishnav said the interim order has been passed to protect people from unnecessary harassment. The Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021, which penalises forcible or fraudulent religious conversion through marriage, was notified by the state government on June 15. Last month, the Gujarat chapter of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind filed a petition saying some of the amended sections of the law were unconstitutional. On Thursday, Chief Justice Nath said, "We are of the opinion that pending further hearing, rigors of section 3,4, 4a to 4c, 5, 6, and 6a shall not operate merely because the marriage is solemnised by a person of one religion with another religion without force, allurement or fraudulent means and such marriages cannot be termed as marriage for the purpose of unlawful conversion." "This interim order is to protect the parties which solemnised interfaith marriages from unnecessary harassment," he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-299

Security forces had launched a search operation in the Thanamandi belt following inputs about the presence of terrorists there, a police official said. The search operation turned into an encounter after the terrorists opened fire on the forces, who retaliated, the official said. "One JCO of the Rashtriya Rifles had suffered bullet injuries in the encounter. The JCO was immediately evacuated to the nearest medical facility, but he succumbed to the injuries," said Defence Public Relations Officer (PRO), Jammu, Lt Col Devender Anand.

19-08-2021||India||Param Bir Singh fined Rs 25,000 for not appearing before inquiry team||An inquiry commission headed by a retired high court judge has imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh for not appearing before it. The Maharashtra government in March this year formed a one-member commission of Justice (retd) Kailash Uttamchand Chandiwal to conduct a probe into corruption allegations levelled by Singh against the then state home minister Anil Deshmukh. As Singh failed to appear before the commission on Wednesday, a fine of Rs 25,000 was imposed on him, a government lawyer said on Thursday. During the previous hearing, the probe panel had given Singh the "last chance" to appear before it. This is the second instance of fine being imposed on Singh. In June, the commission had asked the senior IPS officer to pay a fine Rs 5,000 for not appearing before it despite a summons. The amount was to be deposited in the Chief Minister's COVID-19 Relief Fund. Days after he was shunted out as Mumbai police commissioner and transferred to the Home Guards in March, Singh claimed in a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray that Deshmukh used to ask police officers to collect money from restaurant and bar owners in Mumbai. Deshmukh, an NCP leader, has denied the allegations. The Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate are probing the allegations made against Deshmukh by the senior IPS officer.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-299

Mayur Munde, who built the temple, could not be reached for comments on what prompted him to remove the bust. Meanwhile, some NCP workers on Thursday staged a mock protest outside the temple in Aundh area here in Maharashtra. "Optimism had prevailed in the city that now (after construction of the temple for Modi), the fuel prices would come down, inflation would dip and people will get Rs 15 lakh in their accounts. However, we came here and saw that the 'god' is missing from the temple," NCP city unit president Prashant Jagtap said sarcastically. He said constructing such a temple was a symbol of "intellectual bankruptcy". Munde, 37, had earlier said the temple was his tribute to the prime minister who "built Ram temple at Ayodhya". "After becoming PM, Modi has done a lot of developmental work and dealt with issues such as the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir, Ram Mandir construction and triple talaq successfully," he had said. Munde had also said the prime minister's bust, as well as the red marble used in construction, were brought from Jaipur and the total expenditure was around Rs 1.6 lakh.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-299
19-08-2021||India||Chairman P. Ashish Sharma leads Hathras towards a new era of  Development||Accountability is something which people seek from the elected representatives. The people in today’s time understand the power of the ballot and the differences it can make. For any City or Town, to keep up with the pace of exceptional growth, it requires a leader who has a vision to take the City/Town to new heights of development and growth. P. Ashish, the Chairman of Hathras Municipal Council is the new man who is credited with taking Hathras to an all new different league of development. Hathras, a city with historical significance, was always way ahead of its time. The beautiful city located in Uttar Pradesh was a city worth living with all the necessary amenities available but somehow, since the last few decades, the city has lost its charm and there has been an unprecedented decline in both development and preservation of the city’s rich heritage. Reversing this, P.Ashish Sharma took the charge and is now leading the city to help it find its lost glory. He aims to give a makeover to Hathras, a city very close to his heart. Ashish was elected for the post of the Chairman of Hathras Municipal Council in 2017. Since occupying the office, he has made several changes in the upgradation of the city particularly in the infrastructure sector. A lot of old damaged roads were built and several new ones have come up. He is rigorously working to solve the drainage system of the city by installing an effective sewage treatment plan. He is also making sure that an adequate amount of cleaning drinking water reaches every household in the city. A project which he is closely monitoring himself is the renovation of the historical “ Ghantaghar.” Ashish understands the importance of the 200 year old “ Ghantaghar” and hence he is working towards making sure it is renovated in such a way that will boost the beauty of the city and will attract tourists eventually generating a lot of employment opportunities for the locals. Hathras is also known for its 10000 sq ft pond which is a very famous tourist attraction. Ashish plans to revamp it and convert it into a picnic spot where people can enjoy the beauty of nature. When people were not getting full support from the government,P. Ashish Sharma emerged as the man of the hour on the ground comforting people and providing them with all their requirements. He made sure that cleanliness and hygiene were his top most priority. He introduced a new endeavour under which all the aspects related to cleanliness were taken care at night making it convenient for the cleaners to sanitize the space. Ashish is also committed to the development of a community centre which will help the poor and the underprivileged people for hosting their functions free of cost. Ashish has been working tirelessly since holding the post of Chairman of Hathras Municipal Council. He has brought several changes and a lot of projects are in the pipeline. Hathras was recognised and awarded for its cleanliness in Bangalore and a lot of this was possible because of P. Ashish Sharma. He is not willing to take rest until he completely renovates the city and brings back its lost glory.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-299
19-08-2021||India||Over 50 crore samples tested for Covid in India till now||The number of samples tested for COVID-19 in the country has crossed the 50 crore-mark and in this month, the average daily testing has been over 17 lakh, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said on Thursday. The last 10 crore tests were done in only 55 days, the ICMR said in a statement. "On July 21, 2021, India had tested 45 crore COVID-19 samples, which reached the 50-crore mark on August 18, 2021," the ICMR said. According to its website, 50,03,00,840 samples have been tested up to August 18. "ICMR has been enhancing COVID-19 testing capability across the country by expanding and diversifying testing capacity by leveraging technology and facilitating innovation in affordable diagnostic kits. The testing strategy has been carefully calibrated to increase access and availability of testing," the ICMR said. It said that in this month, the average daily testing was of more than 17 lakh. ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said, "We have seen that exponential increase in testing led to early identification, prompt isolation and effective treatment of COVID-19 cases." "This testing milestone is testimony to the fact that India has been successful in implementing strategy of '5T' approach 'Test, Track, Trace, Treat and use of Technology' efficiently, which will enable us to contain the spread of the pandemic," he said. Further, enhanced production of diagnostic kits has made India 'atmamirbhar' (self-reliant), which has resulted in reduction of cost and improved availability of testing kits, Bhargava said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-299
19-08-2021||India||Calcutta HC directs CBI, SIT to probe Bengal post-poll violence cases||The Calcutta High Court on Thursday ordered CBI probe into grievous cases such as murder and rape in alleged post-poll violence in Bengal. A five-judge bench headed by Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal also ordered the formation of a special investigation team (SIT) to probe all other offences related to the alleged post-poll violence. The bench said both the investigations will be monitored by the court. It directed the central agency to file a report on its investigation in the next six weeks. The SIT will comprise IPS officers Director General (Telecommunications) Suman Bala Sahoo, Calcutta Police Commissioner Soumen Mitra and Ranveer Kumar. The court had ordered the National Human Rights Commission to set up an eight-member committee to visit the clash-hit areas and meet people allegedly attacked by supporters of the Trinamul Congress. The committee submitted a report to the court admitting the petitioners’ contention of post-poll violence by the ruling party. The report recommended that each incident be probed by an independent investigating agency like the CBI. The state government opposed the NHRC recommendations. Appearing for the state and police, advocates Kapil Sibbal and Abhisekh Manu Singhvi argued that members of the committee were BJP activists and the report was politically biased. Appearing for the NHRC, advocate Mahesh Jethmalani claimed the bench should hand over each case to an independent agency for probe.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-299
19-08-2021||India||Did Goyal overstep his brief while launching a tirade against Tatas?  ||So, the big question is whether Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal overstepped the mark when he dressed down the country’s business elite in a speech last week. Speculation is rife about why Goyal chose a CII meeting attended by Indian industry’s top brass to launch a scathing attack on the Tatas? Was Goyal acting out of pique because the Tatas had vigorously opposed his proposals to regulate the e-commerce sector where they are planning a splashy expansion at a recent meeting? Or has he been nursing a grudge against them that dates back to the Modi government’s first term in office? Alternatively, did he get a green signal to indicate that the government has its grouses with industry but went further than his brief by launching an all-out intemperate attack that appeared to lash out at everyone gathered? He certainly chose a bad platform to launch the attack with all of Indian industry gathered even if virtually. And Goyal didn’t mince his words in hitting out at the Tatas and complaining that they were against the government’s rules intended to help consumers: “A company such as yours… perhaps you bought one or two foreign companies, now their importance has become more important than the national interest,” he said. The result is that Goyal reportedly received a dressing down from the prime minister and had to make an apology to the Tatas. This is quite a comedown for a minister who was initially hailed as one of the brightest stars in the Modi Mark-1 government and who was chosen to mind the shop at the finance ministry when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was unwell. Jaitley’s death should have made Goyal the frontrunner for the top job controlling the government’s purse strings. But after the veteran minister’s death, it seemed that Goyal was knocked out of the running because of what was perceived as his over-eagerness to fill Jaitley’s shoes and Nirmala Sitharaman finally got the job. Whoever’s noses he may put out of joint, his bruising attack on industry didn’t stop him from being the top-billed guest at the National IP Awards on Monday. The awards meeting is jointly hosted by CII, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and the Indian Patent Office. In the last few weeks, Goyal has been chief guest at two other CII meetings. Goyal has been spearheading efforts to change the e-commerce rules that have been opposed by foreign giants like Amazon and Flipkart-Walmart. The government argues that sites like Flipkart-Walmart and Amazon are commercial platforms and for a level playing field they should not sell products belonging to their own group. However, the Tatas are also planning a mega-entry into the e-commerce field and are developing a super-app for this. The changes would hit their ability to sell products made by companies like the recently acquired Tata-1MG, the biggest player in online pharmaceuticals. The Tatas have also bought a controlling stake in BigBasket, the online grocery supplier. The group is looking at online sales of Starbucks products as well. Goyal is said to have been taken aback when the Tatas opposed his e-commerce rule changes even more strenuously than Amazon and Flipkart-Walmart. Reliance Jio is the other big player in the online e-commerce sector. The government has made several changes to the e-commerce rules that have mainly hit foreign-owned companies Flipkart-Walmart and Amazon. The rule that the platform owners should not have sales by their own group companies has already affected Amazon which initially had a 49 per cent stake in online retail company Cloudtail which was 51 per cent owned by Infosys co-founder N. R. Narayana Moorthy. In 2019, following government rule changes, Amazon had brought down its Cloudtail holding to 25 per cent. Similarly, Flipkart-Walmart had reduced its holding in a company called Appario from 49 per cent to 25 per cent. Companies with less than a 26 per cent holding are not classified as group companies. The government now wants to disallow even this. The government and the Tata Group are also expected to be working together on the disinvestment of Air India. The Tata Group is expected to get control of Air India. SpiceJet is also reported to be bidding for Air India but it’s unclear whether it can muster the financial muscle for such a big takeover. Goyal is normally known as outspoken both at events and private meetings. Relations between business and the government have been up and down for some time and the commerce ministry’s criticism of industry practices could further hurt the chemistry.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-299
19-08-2021||India||See who all are also back from Afghanistan||Three sniffer dogs — Maya, Ruby, Bobby — who had served the Indo-Tibetan Border Police commandos for three years in Afghanistan have returned to India. The K-9 sniffer dog squad was deployed at the Indian embassy in Kabul with 150 paramilitary personnel. After the Taliban seized the country, they were airlifted along with the ITBP personnel, 30 diplomats and civilians from Kabul as India evacuated its embassy staff on Tuesday. The three dogs were brought to Delhi on Wednesday from Jamnagar where the Indian Air Force plane had first landed. Sources in the ITBP said the sniffer dogs had served the paramilitary force at the Indian embassy in Kabul for three years and had a challenging task in ensuring the safety and security of the staff. “The canines were trained at the National Training Centre for Dogs and were deployed in Kabul in 2019,” said an ITBP official. The dogs, the official said, had detected several IEDs during their service in Kabul.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-299
19-08-2021||India||India following developments in Afghanistan very carefully, says Jaishankar ||With the Taliban now in control in Kabul, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday said New Delhi is very carefully following the developments in Afghanistan and India's focus is on ensuring the security and safe return of Indian nationals still in the war-torn country. Jaishankar, addressing reporters at the UN Security Council stakeout after chairing an open-debate on peacekeeping under India's current UNSC Presidency, said, "The situation (in Afghanistan) is really what has been very much the focus of my own engagements here, talking to the UN Secretary-General and other colleagues who are here as well as the US Secretary of State. "At the moment we are, like everybody else, very carefully following developments in Afghanistan. I think our focus is on ensuring the security in Afghanistan and the safe return of Indian nationals who are there," he said in response to a question by PTI. Jaishankar has discussed the situation in Afghanistan in his bilateral meetings here, including with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. He arrived in New York on Monday as the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting on the situation in Afghanistan, the second time in just over the 10 days that the powerful UN body met under India's Presidency for the month of August to discuss the situation in the war-torn country. In response to another question on India's investments in Afghanistan over the last two decades and whether New Delhi will be engaged in Afghanistan now that the Taliban is in control, he said, "You used the word investment. I mean, for us, it reflected what was a historical relationship with the Afghan people. "I think that relationship with the Afghan people obviously continues and that will guide our approach to Afghanistan in the coming days. At this time, as I said, these are early days. Our focus right now is on ensuring the safety and security of Indian nationals who are there," he said. Asked whether India has had any communication with the Taliban in recent days, Jaishankar said: at this point of time, we are looking at what is the evolving situation in Kabul. "Obviously, the Taliban and its representatives have come to Kabul so I think we need to take it on from there, he said without directly responding to the question. Following his meeting with Guterres in the UN headquarters on Tuesday, Jaishankar had tweeted Good to meet UN Secretary-General @antonioguterres. Our discussions focused on Afghanistan, following upon the Security Council meeting yesterday. He also met Estonia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Eva-Maria Liimets and as UNSC members, discussed our working together on maritime and cybersecurity and other global issues. Exchanged views on the developments in Afghanistan. Look forward to her presence at the Council meeting tomorrow. Jaishankar also discussed the "latest developments in Afghanistan with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and underlined the urgency of restoring airport operations in Kabul. Deeply appreciate the American efforts underway in this regard. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that Blinken spoke with Jaishankar today about Afghanistan and the developing situation there. Jaishankar said he also discussed the evolving situation in Afghanistan with French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian. "We will continue to coordinate in the UN Security Council. Thank him for evacuating 21 Indian nationals from Kabul to Paris," he added. India on Tuesday rushed back home its ambassador Rudrendra Tandon and staff from the embassy in Kabul in a military transport aircraft following escalating tension, fear and uncertainty gripping the Afghan capital after the Taliban insurgents seized the Afghan capital on Sunday. The C-17 Globemaster aircraft of the Indian Air Force carrying around 150 people, including diplomats, officials, security personnel and some stranded Indians, landed at the Hindon airbase near the national capital at around 5 PM after a brief halt at Jamnagar in Gujarat, in the wake of escalating tension, fear and uncertainty gripping the Afghan capital after its take over by the Taliban two days back. It was the second evacuation flight as another C-17 aircraft brought back around 40 people from the Hamid Karzai International (HKI) Airport in Kabul on Monday as part of India's emergency evacuation mission that was carried out following coordination with relevant authorities including US officials handling security at the airport in the Afghan capital.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-300

19-08-2021||India||Drowned Odisha  girl’s eyes donated ||Parents of a nine-year old girl who drowned in a pond at Bankasole village in Mayurbhanj district of Odisha have donated her eyes to help “remove darkness from someone’s life”. Mahendra Basuri, father of the girl Sriya, told The Telegraph: “On August 15 after playing with her friends, she had gone to the nearby village pond for a bath. Her feet slipped and she drowned. Our grief knows no bounds. Her mother is inconsolable.” Sriya, who studied in Class IV in Bhubaneswar, had gone to her village under Kuliana police station in May to spend some time with her relatives during the lockdown. “We were to leave for Bhubaneswar on Monday but this mishap occurred,” said her father. Mahendra, who is an assistant professor in a private college in Bhubaneswar, said: “It was a tough decision to donate her eyes. But we wanted that the eyes of my daughter should light up someone else’s world. Let it help remove darkness from someone’s life.” His brother Suvendu, a social worker, said: “It was heartbreaking but we suggested to my brother to donate the eyes of her daughter to help someone see the world through them. He immediately agreed. We contacted the L.V. Prasad Eye Institute. The next day (August 16), they sent their team to carry out the procedure. Both her eyes were intact. Hopefully someone will be able to see the world through them.” Sriya’s mother Priya said: “We know she will not come back. But we will have the satisfaction that her eyes could help someone who needs them.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-300
19-08-2021||India||Modi government’s responses to Afghan evacuation draws criticism||When India padlocked its mission in Kabul and effected a chaotic evacuation late on Monday evening, it took more than five hours for the escaping caravan to reach the military airbase just four kilometres away. Officials most likely tapped into tenuous links with local Taliban commanders to see themselves through, but those tortuous hours were probably symbolic of the sudden and sheer fall New Delhi has taken in Afghanistan — from being an old and deeply invested player and partner to a self-proclaimed superpower bereft of agency and panicked into abrupt ejection. It was courtesy the American armed forces that Indian mission staff were even able to bail out. It is evident that the swift and easy sweep of the Taliban over the Afghan capital left governments across the world numb and nonplussed. In India, it has raised sharp and critical questions over the Narendra Modi government’s anticipation and responses — logistical, strategic and diplomatic. The blame for blundering has come to stick no less because the foreign office is helmed by S. Jaishankar, a widely-experienced former foreign secretary. “It is too early to analyse the medium and long term implications of this radical shift in our neighbourhood, but forget that for the moment,” a career diplomat told The Telegraph. “Why did we not secure the evacuation of our diplomats and officials, and even citizens much earlier? Everybody knew the Americans were leaving in droves and the Taliban were coming, what were we thinking? We were stoned in the head, and leaden in our feet, we just did not react or move the way we should have. Why did we have to leave in such ungainly fashion at the last minute, almost at the mercy of Taliban traffic controllers? And what are we going to do now for Indians still stranded in far Afghan corners, or our valuable human assets?” He called the last few days an “alarming enactment of a foreign policy disaster” and went on: “We’ve been dealt a severe and strategic blow in our immediate neighbourhood, and it has happened because we obdurately blindsided ourselves, we refused to see what was coming, we let the United States misread the situation for us, we grossly neglected what we required to do in our own national interest. The Americans were leaving, we were merely getting left behind.” Former ambassador to Afghanistan, Vivek Katju, put it more bluntly: “I have been arguing for years that we should have opened negotiations with the Taliban, more so after it became apparent to everybody that their takeover of Afghanistan was imminent. I mean the Americans were talking to them across the table, why didn’t we? Others have articulated the same advice but it got no attention from the current framers of foreign policy.” Asked if India would not have legitimised the Taliban by talking to them, Katju said: “Look, what’s foremost is your national interest and how you serve it. There are principles and very often there are the requirements of pragmatism. After all, you often negotiate with your enemies as well, that does not mean you are embracing them or their ways. Where have we left ourselves in Afghanistan today?” Another former ambassador to Kabul, Rakesh Sood, expressed similar misgivings during a panel discussion hosted by The Print on Tuesday. He blamed the establishment for “putting all its eggs in one basket (meaning the US basket, or the abdicated Ashraf Ghani basket)” and said that India could have thought it out much better for itself. He also felt New Delhi should have “engaged” with the Taliban. In the context of India’s scrambled exit from Kabul, Sood said New Delhi could have planned the evacuation in a much more organised way. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a foreign policy think-tank scholar said: “We could have done many things to avoid the mess we are in, but we did not. India is a regional power, it has leverage, it has resources. We could have pressed the US to not quit in such haste, at least demonstrated our reservations. We could have prevailed upon Ashraf Ghani to give way, or if not that, open up decision-making to a larger body like a shura, a broader council of Afghan elders, to achieve a smoother transition. Instead, we merely toed what the Americans were doing and what Ghani was falsely promising he would do to resist the Taliban advance.” There has, of course, always been a strong counter-argument in the Indian foreign policy establishment to any engagement with the Taliban. Back in 2018, India had sent two representatives — Amar Sinha, former ambassador to Kabul, and T.C.A. Raghavan, former envoy to Islamabad — for talks on the evolving future of Afghanistan to Moscow. “They were sent with express instructions to not even look at the Talibanis on the table,” a foreign policy insider said. Deep reservations about the Taliban in the Indian establishment spring not merely from their bellicose Islamist and militarist mien; they are equally, if not more, predicated on the Taliban’s close ties with Pakistan and a deep, and justified, scepticism about establishing trust with the mainly Pashtun militia which now holds sway over most of Afghanistan. The conviction that the Taliban will forever do Pakistan’s bidding even if India were to try and make deals with them, runs strong across South Block. As another former ambassador, Deb Mukharji, said: “Look, the Taliban know where India stands in relation to them, you cannot sweet-talk them into deals, and they are not reliable people. This is a very difficult area for many reasons. But that said, if we had not blindly followed the US script in Afghanistan, we probably would have known better.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-300
19-08-2021||India||Covid: Study underlines need for shorter Covishield dose gap||A large hospital-based study in India has found that a single dose of Covishield offers no protection from Covid-19 symptoms or severe disease, amplifying apprehensions about India’s current policy of a 12-week gap between two doses. The new findings from the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, bolster the evidence for arguments to shorten the gap between two doses and to prioritise vaccinations for people who have not had prior Covid-19 infections, doctors said The Ganga Ram study that tracked over 4,700 hospital workers — doctors, nurses, and paramedics — found no significant differences in the incidence of symptomatic Covid-19 infections, moderate or severe disease, or oxygen requirements between single-dose recipients and the unvaccinated. While earlier observations from the UK and India had suggested that a single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine — Covishield in India — offers lower protection than two doses, the Ganga Ram study found “no protection” from a single dose. The Ganga Ram doctors conducted the study during March and April this year, a period when the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant was driving India’s second Covid-19 wave with surges in daily new infections across the country. “A long gap between two doses might not be such a good idea — especially in areas anticipating a surge,” said Ambarish Satwik, a study team member and senior consultant at the hospital’s Institute of Vascular and Endovascular Sciences. The study also found that previous infections were “significantly protective” against symptomatic infections, moderate to severe disease and oxygen requirements. The level of protection from prior infections appeared to be higher than that offered by a single or double doses of the vaccine. The “no protection” in the Ganga Ram study contrasts with the 61 per cent protection after one dose observed among healthcare workers at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, and 33 per cent protection reported by Public Health England, the UK’s health agency. The Union health ministry had on May 23 expanded the gap between Covishield doses from 6-8 weeks to 12-16 weeks, citing evidence that a longer gap gives a better response. Delaying the second dose allows more people to get the first dose and, experts say, the decision to delay doses takes into account potential gains of expanding the pool of people with first doses and the potential risks of delaying second doses. Sections of health experts in India have been arguing for the need to shorten the gap between Covishield doses at least for vulnerable populations, citing the low protection levels from a single dose noted in the Public Health England study. “The Ganga Ram study reinforces the urgency of protecting the vulnerable groups and essential workers with both doses as soon as possible,” said K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India and a member of the national Covid-19 task force, who was not associated with the study. Health officials and medical researchers have cited available evidence, including the CMC Vellore study, to argue that a single Covishield dose also offers some protection against severe disease and death. But as the daily new infections surged in Delhi during March and April, the Ganga Ram doctors noticed through anecdotal observations that hospital co-workers who had a single dose were more likely to become infected than those who had received two doses. “Our study data matches those anecdotal observations,” said Ruma Satwik, the lead author of the study, published this week in the European Journal of Internal Medicine, a peer-reviewed research journal. In countries facing vaccine shortages, health administrators should consider early full vaccinations, prioritising those never infected, the researchers have suggested.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-300
19-08-2021||India||Amit Shah custody judge overlooked||Justice Akil Abdulhamid Kureshi, one of the senior-most high court chief justices in the country and who had remanded Amit Shah in CBI custody over a decade ago, does not figure on the list cleared for elevation to the Supreme Court by the collegium on Wednesday. The Supreme Court collegium, headed by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana, formally cleared nine chief justices and judges of various high courts for the elevation. The list has been cleared less than a week after Justice R.F. Nariman, the third senior-most member of the Supreme Court collegium, retired. Justice Nariman was learnt to have insisted when he was part of the collegium that a senior judge like Justice Kureshi be elevated to the apex court before the other names were considered. As a result, there appeared to be a stalemate on the elevation of judges to the Supreme Court for several months, sources said. Justice Nariman retired on August 12. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the five-member Supreme Court deliberated on a set of names and cleared the nine, omitting Justice Kureshi who is due to retire in March next year. Justice Kureshi had sent Amit Shah, now Union home minister, to CBI custody in 2010 in a case related to the death of gangster Sohrabuddin Sheikh in an encounter that was then alleged to have been staged. Justice Kureshi, who was then senior judge in Bombay High Court, was named the Tripura High Court chief justice in 2019 after a deadlock between the then collegium and the Narendra Modi government. The collegium had initially chosen Justice Kureshi to preside over Madhya Pradesh High Court, which has 40 judges. But the Modi government had refused to clear his name. The deadlock was eventually broken when the collegium, headed by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi, decided to shift Justice Kureshi to Tripura High Court, which has four judges. The present collegium of Justices Ramana, U.U. Lalit, A.M. Khanwilkar, D.Y. Chandrachud and L. Nageswara Rao discussed the names till 8.30pm on Tuesday. An in-principle decision was taken on Tuesday night and the names were formally cleared on Wednesday evening to be sent to the Union government for approval. Three women are among the nine candidates cleared, among them Justice B.V. Nagarathna, a Karnataka High Court judge who will eventually become Chief Justice of India between September and October 2027 for a brief period of 40 days. The others cleared for elevation to the Supreme Court are Karnataka High Court Chief Justice A.S. Oka; Gujarat High Court Chief Justice Vikram Nath; Sikkim High Court Chief Justice J.K. Maheshwari; Telangana High Court’s Justice Hima Kohli; Kerala High Court judge, Justice C.T. Ravi Kumar; Madras High Court judge, Justice M.M. Sundresh; Gujarat High Court judge, Justice Bela M. Trivedi; and senior advocate P.S. Narasimha. Most of the elevated chief justices and judges are relatively junior to Justice Kureshi in terms of experience or stints as judges in high courts. There is no hard and fast rule that the senior-most judge or chief justice of a high court should be elevated to the Supreme Court. But as a convention, seniority is accorded high priority. Repeated efforts by The Telegraph to elicit comment from CJI Ramana on the reasons for excluding Justice Kureshi from the list did not yield results. A resolution uploaded by the Supreme Court on Wednesday did not refer to the factors taken into account while elevating the nine judges to the apex court. CJI anguish At a farewell speech in honour of Justice Navin Sinha who retired on Wednesday, CJI Ramana expressed anguish at reports relating to the collegium surfacing in a section of the media. The CJI said: “Personally, I’m left feeling quite saddened by his (Justice Sinha’s) retirement. We are losing an important voice and a valued colleague. On this occasion, I want to take the liberty to express my concern about certain speculations and reports in the media. “You are all aware we need to appoint judges to this court. The process is ongoing. Meetings will be held and decisions will be taken. The process of appointment of judges is sacrosanct and has certain dignity attached to it. “My media friends must understand and recognise the sanctity of this process. As an institution, we hold the freedom of media and the rights of individuals in high esteem. Today’s reflections in some sections of the media, pending the process, even before formalising the resolution, are counter-productive.” CJI Ramana added: “There were instances of deserving career progression of bright talent getting marred because of such irresponsible reporting and speculation. This is very unfortunate and I am extremely upset about it. “I must also place on record the tremendous amount of maturity and responsibility displayed by majority of senior journalists and media houses in showing restraint and not speculating on such a serious matter. Such professional journalists and ethical media are the real strength of the Supreme Court, in particular, and democracy, in general. “You are part of our system. I expect all the stakeholders to uphold the integrity and dignity of this institution. I am sure Brother Sinha will forgive me for deviating a bit on this solemn occasion.

Adria Jagaranga’s death in Rayagada district underlines the problem of poor Internet connectivity in rural areas that has helped create a digital divide among the country’s students and prompted educationists to appeal to the Centre to provide universal digital access. Adria’s family said the boy had gone to the hilltop with three friends. The boulder he had climbed slipped and he fell more than 50ft with it, the stone crushing his right leg. He died on the way to hospital. The boy was a Class VIII student at the Missionary High School in Cuttack. Schools have recently reopened in Odisha. “He was to return to school on August 22, so he was desperate to complete his homework,” a relative said. A fire brigade officer from nearby Padampur, Sushant Sethi, said heavy rain had made the hilltop slippery. “We received a call from a resident to rescue the boy who had met with an accident,” he said. “By the time we reached the spot, 25km from the fire station, the boy had been brought down from the hill on a cot by his family. He died on the way to hospital.” Rabindranath Mohapatra, a local reporter, said Internet connectivity and mobile networks were poor in the area, forcing many students to climb to hilltops or treetops to attend their online classes. The situation is similar across the country’s rural areas. This newspaper had last year reported how 25 male and female students in a Sambalpur village clambered atop a 150ft water tank every day to be able to connect to their classes. Odisha school and mass education minister Samir Ranjan Dash said the state government had asked the Centre to set up mobile towers in rural areas, “particularly in tribal and Maoist-hit areas”. He said chief minister Naveen Patnaik had taken the matter up with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. However, the Centre appears to have passed the responsibility on to the states, although educationists say the Union government alone has the wherewithal to provide digital access to all students. “Education is a subject in the concurrent list of the Constitution,” education minister Dharmendra Pradhan had told Parliament recently. “Accordingly, the state governments have been directed to act based on the situation prevailing at every place to meet the demands of all students for providing them with the digital access required for learning digitally.” Apart from poor connectivity, erratic power supply and the lack of quality devices too have left economically disadvantaged and rural students in the lurch. Biju Dharamapalan, a teacher at M.G. University, Kottayam, had told this newspaper the Centre should “provide smart phones or TV sets with DTH connections to economically backward students”. Ram Ramaswamy, an academic at the Indian Academy of Sciences, had said the Centre must ensure that “economically disadvantaged students get at least a free tablet and cheap data”. Odisha minister Dash said: “Even though schools and colleges have reopened, the student turnout is only 60 to 70 per cent. Many parents are afraid to send their children to school. So, many of these students still depend on online classes.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-300
19-08-2021||India||Centre's ayurveda cocktail not beneficial against Covid: Research||A herbal formulation promoted by India’s ayurveda ministry as a remedy against mild and moderate Covid-19 and included in its clinical management protocols has no beneficial effect against the infection, new research has suggested. Doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur, have found no differences in the course of Covid-19 infections or viral clearance between patients who received the formulation, Ayush-64, and those who had received standard care. Their study found that while the formulation was safe and had no adverse effects, there were no significant differences in the fever patterns, respiratory symptoms or key blood test measurements between patients who had received Ayush-64 and those on standard care. “Ayush-64 has no significant beneficial effect” compared with the standard care, Jaykaran Charan, associate professor of pharmacology at AIIMS, Jodhpur, and his colleagues said in their study, not peer-reviewed yet but posted on Wednesday on medRxiv, an online preprint server. The findings appear to contradict the results of an earlier study led by the Centre for Rheumatic Diseases, Pune, which had suggested that Ayush-64 “hastened recovery, reduced hospitalisation, and improved overall health in mild and moderate Covid-19” when given with standard care. The AIIMS study had 60 patients while the earlier study tracked 140 patients. The earlier positive results and the new negative results, the AIIMS doctors said, underlined the need for validating the efficacy of Ayush-64 against Covid-19 through a rigorous “double-blind” trial with a large sample of patients. A double-blind study is one in which neither the patients nor the doctors know who is receiving Ayush-64 and who is receiving standard care and are intended to minimise any bias or placebo effects. The call for a rigorous evaluation of Ayush-64 against Covid-19 comes months after the Union ministry for ayurveda, yoga, unani, siddha and homoeopathy (ayush) described the formulation as “one of the most significant developments” for treating Covid-19. The ayush ministry had in April this year said the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences had conducted “extensive robust clinical trials focusing on the management of asymptomatic, mild to moderate Covid-19” in collaboration with medical colleges across India. The trials had shown that Ayush-64 had anti-viral, immune-modulating and anti-fever effects and “it is found useful in the treatment of asymptomatic, mild and moderate Covid-19 infections”, the ministry had said. The ayush ministry’s national clinical management protocol for Covid-19 too lists Ayush-64. The ministry said six clinical studies had shown “very promising trends” based on which it was included in the protocol. But sections of doctors have long called for caution in interpreting any clinical trial results, especially those involving mild or moderate Covid-19. “We know 80 per cent of Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms will likely recover on their own,” said an internal medicine specialist who requested not to be named. “Studies need to be well-designed to distinguish whether the patients recovered on their own or because of the beneficial effect of a medication.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-300
19-08-2021||India||Taliban insurgency: Your questions answered||When did India close its consulates in Afghanistan? The Herat and Jalalabad consulates were closed in April 2020, ostensibly because of the pandemic. India refrained from reopening them owing to the US plans to withdraw troops. Indians working at the Kandahar consulate were evacuated in July this year as a “temporary measure”. On August 10, Indians working at the Mazar-e-Sharif consulate were evacuated along with Indian nationals from in and around the area who were able to get to the mission in time for the special flight. How many Indians are estimated to be still in Afghanistan? There’s no official number. In a written reply tabled in the Rajya Sabha on August 5, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said: “According to available information, there are approximately 1,500 Indian nationals in Afghanistan including the Government of India officials.” Since then, this number is likely to have come down. The embassy website had earlier put the figure at 1,710. On Tuesday, the ministry said: “We understand that a number of Indians are stranded in that country, some of whom are employed by third country organisations. Our immediate priority is to obtain accurate information about all Indian nationals currently in Afghanistan. They and/or their employers are requested to urgently share the relevant details with MEA’s Special Afghanistan Cell.” Some of the Indians in Afghanistan had, according to ambassador Rudrendra Tandon, reached out to the mission but were in areas that were too far away to access any longer. How many advisories did India issue? Over the past two months, India has issued four security advisories for its nationals in Afghanistan: on June 29, July 24, August 10 and August 12. The last two advisories told Indians to make immediate arrangements to return to India while commercial air services were still operating. Indian companies operating in Afghanistan were advised to withdraw their Indian employees from project sites before air services were discontinued. The August 12 advisory mentioned how three Indian engineers had needed emergency air rescue from a dam project site in an area outside the control of the Afghan government. What level of contact did India have with the Taliban? Officially, India has never acknowledged any contact with the Taliban. But since earlier this year, there have been media reports saying India has engaged directly with the Taliban. The foreign ministry has neither confirmed nor denied these reports. In June, Qatar’s special envoy for counter-terrorism and mediation of conflict resolution, Mutlaq bin Majed Al Qahtani, said at a web conference that Indian officials had made a “quiet visit” to Doha to speak to the Taliban’s political leadership. The Indian foreign ministry’s response to this too was that India was in touch with all stakeholders in pursuance of its long-term commitment towards development and reconstruction in Afghanistan. What was the level of India’s participation in multilaterals related to Afghanistan’s future? India was invited to witness the signing of the US-Taliban agreement in Doha on February 29 last year. India attended the first round of intra-Afghan talks in Doha in September last year with a joint-secretary-level official attending in person and foreign minister S. Jaishankar joining in via videoconferencing. Last week, when Doha hosted peace talks on Afghanistan, India found itself on the sidelines. It was not present at the opening session of a meeting that included the US, China, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and the UK and was kept out of the Troika-Plus talks between Russia, US, China and Pakistan that had been convened by Moscow.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-300
19-08-2021||India||RRAG plea to NHRC to ensure refugee status for Afghans||The Rights and Risks Analysis Group (RRAG) has petitioned the National Human Rights Commission to ensure that refugee status is granted to Afghans, including some MPs, who have already entered India. Based on media reports and interviews with some of them, the RRAG has listed the names of legislators: Wahidullah Kaleemzai, member of Parliament from Wardak; Abdul Aziz Hakimi, MP from Parwan; Abdul Qadir Zazai, secretary-general of the Wolesi Jirga (Lower House of Parliament); Senator Malem Lala Gul; Shukria Esakhail, MP from Baghlan; Senator Mohammad Khan; Mariam Solaimankhail, MP; and Qais Mowafaq, senior adviser to Afghanistan’s Upper House. As of date, the government — while announcing that it will not abandon its partners among the locals in Afghanistan — has not officially put out the list of the number or the names of those Afghans who have already entered India. Asked about the source of the names listed in his petition, RRAG’s director Suhas Chakma said it was based on media reports. Referring to the government’s decision to issue the “e-Emergency X-Misc Visa” to help Afghans who may want to move to India, the RRAG petition states that this is inadequate under the circumstances. “First, visa by definition comes with an expiry date and can be denied at any time. Second, visa by definition also excludes extension of any humanitarian assistance by the government and any possibility to work or engage in activities necessary for survival. The grant of visa does not take into account the situation that these Afghan nationals are not in a position to return to Afghanistan as the Taliban has taken over the entire country and refoulement/repatriation means certain torture or even death,’’ the petition said. The petitioner argues for granting refuge or asylum to those Afghans fleeing their country. “It would be a historic blunder if India fails to grant refugee status and protections to the Afghan nationals who have fled to India irrespective of their religion. The Afghans who fled to India including the members of Parliament named above had worked with the Government of India in the last 20 years, which makes them special targets of the Taliban, and India cannot abandon them by granting only e-visas,’’ it said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-301
19-08-2021||India||SC seeks Centre, states' response on vacancies in the RTI panels||The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the Centre, states and Union Territories to file within three weeks status reports on the vacancies of information commissioners and pending cases under their respective jurisdictions, as it expressed anguish at the large-scale vacancies in the transparency panels. A bench of Justices S. Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari passed the direction while dealing with a joint PIL filed by RTI activists Anjali Bhardwaj, Commodore (retd) Lokesh Batra and Amrita Johri, which claimed that there were nearly 50 per cent vacancies in the Central Information Commission and various state commissions, thus frustrating the very objective of citizens’ right to access information. Advocate Prashant Bhushan appearing for the petitioners said during the hearing that despite the apex court’s earlier judgment in February 2019 to fill up the vacancies, the Union and state governments had failed to fill the vacancies in the information commissions leading to a large number of pending cases and long delays in the disposal of appeals/complaints. The bench while expressing its displeasure at the failure of the states to fill vacancies warned of strict action against non-compliance with its directions. The petitioners pointed out that in its February 2019 judgment, the court had directed the Maharashtra government to ensure that the state information commission functions at full strength (one chief and 10 information commissioners) given the large backlog of appeals and complaints. However, the state commission is functioning with only four information commissioners even though there were more than 75,000 appeals/complaints pending as on May 31, 2021. The bench pulled up the Maharashtra government for not filling the vacancies in the state information commission and warned that the chief secretary will be summoned if the state fails to fill them within three weeks. In case of Karnataka, the court had directed in its 2019 order that the state information commission should function at full strength for which the government must sanction all posts given the large number of pending cases. Whereas the state government sanctioned all posts, however, in the hearing it was pointed out that currently three posts are vacant even though there is backlog of more than 30,000 appeals/complaints in the commission. The bench directed the state to fill the vacancies and file a status report. In the 2019 judgment, the Supreme Court had directed the state of Odisha to sanction three additional posts so the commission can function with one chief and six commissioners given the backlog of cases. During the hearing, it came to light that the state had sanctioned only two additional posts and currently the commission was functioning with only four commissioners. One post had fallen vacant in November 2020 and was yet to be filled up while the chief had retired on August 15 this year. The bench directed the government to file a status report. During the hearing, it was pointed out that the state information commission of Telangana has been functioning without a chief for one year, despite the fact that the RTI Act envisages a crucial role for the official as the general superintendence, direction and management of the affairs of the SIC vests in the chief. The bench expressed disappointment at the state of affairs and directed that the appointment should be made by the next date of hearing. It was highlighted that in the case of the state information commission of Nagaland, the previous chief retired in January 2020 and since then no appointment had been made. As a result, the commission has been headless for 19 months. The state was directed to fill the vacancy and file a status report. In its February 2019 judgment, the court had directed the Bengal government to create three posts of commissioners in addition to the sanctioned strength of three (chief and two information commissioners). During the hearing it was pointed out that currently the commission is functioning with only two commissioners (one chief and one commissioner) though nearly 10,000 appeals/complaints are pending. The bench pulled up the state government for failing to file an affidavit before the hearing and for not filling up the vacancies. On the other hand, though the government of Jharkhand was not a respondent in the case, however, it was pointed out that the state information commission has been effectively rendered defunct since May 2020, when the lone information commissioner retired. Since then no information commissioner or chief has been appointed and the commission has been non-functional with people seeking information having no recourse to the independent appellate mechanism prescribed under the RTI Act. The apex court expressed anguish at the current state of affairs and directed the state to fill up the vacancies and also file a report. The matter regarding the CIC will now be heard next week while state governments have been given three weeks to file status reports indicating the vacancies in their respective state information panels and the number of pending appeals/complaints.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-301
19-08-2021||India||Sheikh Shami Akhtar thrown out of I-Day event for Ambedkar slogan||Sheikh Shami Akhtar, 70, gets such “goosebumps” seeing the Tricolour flutter that since the age of 12, he has been scrupulously attending the Independence Day ceremonies at the local school, block office, hospital and police station one after the other every August 15. Last Sunday, he was thrown out of one of these events — at Ramgarh police station in Bihar’s Kaimur district — because he had chanted a slogan in honour of B.R. Ambedkar after the flag had been hoisted. An assistant sub-inspector pushed him out of the premises, Akhtar said. The officer was suspended on Tuesday after a public protest but the incident has left Akhtar, president of a madrasa in Ramgarh, deeply hurt. Akhtar, who waits eagerly every year for August 15 to arrive, had been feeling happy and tranquil in the morning. This year’s event held particular significance for him — he had lost his wife to Covid in April and thought that attending Independence Day ceremonies would be just the succour he needed. “Participating in Independence Day functions, seeing our national flag flutter proudly and singing the national anthem make me feel happy and invigorated. It gives me goosebumps,” he told The Telegraph. So, donning white kurta-pyjamas and a “Gandhi topi”, he went about his annual ritual. The police station, where the flag was to be hoisted at 9.20am, was the fourth on his list before he would be winding up his programme for the day by attending the flag-hoisting at his madrasa. The event went off smoothly. The national anthem was sung and the guests assembled around the Tricolour began chanting slogans in honour of freedom fighters. Akhtar joined in the chorus and then went on to shout: “Babasaheb Ambedkar amar rahein.” “ASI Vijay Kumar Singh asked me why I had come, who had invited me and why I had chanted the slogan. I replied that people attend and celebrate Independence Day functions without invitation. We are lovers of azadi (independence),” Akhtar said. “He became angry and pushed me out of the police station premises. I was deeply hurt and almost cried, unable to believe this was happening to me in my own country, that too on Independence Day. I went again to the police station, met the station house officer (SHO) and told him I was feeling very sad. I requested him to ask the sub-inspector to apologise, but nothing happened.” Akhtar said none of the officers present intervened, only circle officer Archana Kumari apologised to him when he returned to the police station to complain. The 70-year-old said he had chanted Ambdekar’s name at I-Day events for years and nothing like this ever happened before. Akhtar, whose father was a freedom fighter and a social activist, said it was a tradition at I-Day ceremonies to chant slogans such as “Bharat Mata ki jai”, “Jai Hind”, “Vande Mataram” and a few in the names of leaders of the freedom movement like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, Vallabhbhai Patel, Jayaprakash Narayan, B.R. Ambedkar and Ashfaqulla Khan, among others. “I’m a citizen of India and I attend Independence Day events to express my happiness. I don’t go there for the sweets. My objective is also to increase popular enthusiasm for the occasion so that people understand its importance,” Akhtar said. “We want our country to stay independent and prosper always. If we don’t guide our youths, who will? They may forget everything.” He said he attended Republic Day events with the same fervour. Circle officer Kumari told this newspaper she had apologised to Akhtar since “that was the right thing to do”. News of Akhtar’s humiliation spread and a delegation of local citizens met Kaimur superintendent of police Rakesh Kumar, who asked Mohania deputy superintendent of police Raghu Nath Singh to conduct a probe. “We suspended the ASI on the report of the DSP. He (the ASI) said the gentleman (Akhtar) had chanted the slogan four times, after which he reacted,” SP Kumar told this newspaper. It’s not clear why the ASI thought that chanting Ambedkar’s name multiple times counted as an offence. “However, we suspended him for indulging in angry talk and pushing and shoving the person, that too during the Independence Day function, which was unbecoming of a police officer,” Kumar said. He said a further inquiry would be conducted. He, however, volunteered without elaborating that Akhtar had been chargesheeted in a “law-and-order problem” in Ramgarh in 2018. SHO Ram Kalyan Yadav said he wasn’t posted in Ramgarh at the time and didn’t know about the case. Akhtar said he had been walking past a crowd protesting an alleged rape and murder one day in January 2018 when the police beat up the demonstrators, arrested dozens and booked 200 named and unnamed people for disturbing public order. Akhtar says he got thrashed and arrested, but later received bail. Akhtar said he was not satisfied with the action against the ASI because the suspension order didn’t spell out the specific misconduct the officer had been charged with. D.M. Diwakar, academic and former director of the A.N. Sinha Institute of Social Studies, Patna, said the incident “represented a clash between the people to whom Independence and the suffering during the freedom movement matter more than their lives, and the bureaucracy that has refused to accept the people as their boss instead of subjects”. Diwakar said the ASI represented “the intolerance that’s been bred in society and the ideas of the ruling powers that are damaging for the social fabric of the country”. He said some people “have the mindset that Ambedkar cannot be in the same league with Gandhi and Nehru, when the fact is that he was one of the most mature leaders who worked to unite society and the country”.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-301
19-08-2021||India||Congress slams Shah on Northeast violence and lawlessness||The Congress on Wednesday questioned the competence and commitment of home minister Amit Shah as sensitive border states in the Northeast are pushed into a cycle of violence and lawlessness. “As the media is occupied with Afghanistan, the situation in the Northeast is getting dangerous. Disturbing visuals are witnessed from streets. Assam and Mizoram are firing at each other like enemies and armed men are roaming the streets of Meghalaya and hurling petrol bombs at the chief minister’s residence. And the home minister and the Prime Minister are silent over the collapse of the constitutional order,” Congress communications chief Randeep Surjewala said. “Whose responsibility is it to look after internal security? The governor’s convoy is attacked. The (state) home minister has to resign. A 98-hour curfew had to be imposed,” he said. Curfew was imposed in Shillong and Internet services snapped after the death of a former rebel in a police encounter on August 13 triggered violence. The Assam-Mizoram border has been tense since the end of last month when six Assam policemen were killed in firing from Mizoram. At one point, the Assam government issued an advisory against travel to the neighbouring state. However, travel between the states has since resumed. The Congress spokesperson questioned Shah’s silence on the unrest. “Why is the home minister silent? This completely indifferent, criminally aloof hands-off approach of the central government also emanates from its illegal and often divisive usurpation of power in many northeastern states,” Surjewala said. “Amit Shah has totally failed. There are reports of fresh tension on the Assam-Mizoram border. Can you imagine two Indian states barring travel and transportation across the borders? In Nagaland, the entire peace process and the so-called ‘framework agreement’ of August 3, 2015, remain in the realm of speculation and hearsay. “The NSCN (National Socialist Council of Nagaland) refuses to accept governor R.N. Ravi as the Centre’s interlocutor. The NSCN is refusing to accept India’s Constitution and talks of ‘shared sovereignty’. It is like compromising with India’s territorial integrity,” the Congress leader said. LPG price hike The Congress also blasted the Narendra Modi government for hiking the price of cooking gas cylinder by Rs 25 on Wednesday, arguing that the burden on the poor was being raised everyday at a time income had come down and millions lost their jobs. The price of an LPG cylinder has been increased by Rs 265 since November 2020 to push it to an all-time high of Rs 859. Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said the finance minister was weaving a cock-&-bull story about oil bonds while the real reason was the government’s decision to cut subsidies. “The fuel subsidy, which was Rs 1.47 lakh crore in 2014 has been reduced to Rs 12,000 crore. The government earned Rs 4.53 lakh crore in 2021 through high taxes on petroleum products but refused to pass on the benefit of low international crude oil prices to the consumers,” Shrinate said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-301
19-08-2021||India||Sunanda Pushkar death: Delhi court discharges Shashi Tharoor||A Delhi court on Wednesday discharged Congress leader Shashi Tharoor from all charges, including abetment to suicide, in connection with the death of his wife Sunanda Pushkar in January 2014. “The accused (Mr Tharoor) is discharged,” said special judge Geetanjali Goel during a virtual hearing in which Tharoor was present. In May 2018, Delhi police had filed a chargesheet in the court, accusing Tharoor of abetting the suicide of his wife and subjecting her to cruelty. The case saw several twists and turns during which a murder case was also registered without attributing a motive. After the verdict on Wednesday, Tharoor issued a statement thanking the judge and his lawyers. “I would like to express my humble thanks to Judge Geetanjali Goel for her orders today, discharging me from the charges levied by the Delhi police, which I have consistently described as preposterous,” he said. He added: “This brings a significant conclusion to the long nightmare, which had enveloped me after the tragic passing of my late wife Sunanda. I have weathered dozens of unfounded accusations and media vilification patiently, sustained by my faith in the Indian judiciary, which today stands vindicated. “In our justice system, the process is all too often the punishment. Nonetheless, the fact that justice has been done, at last, will allow all of us in the family to mourn Sunanda in peace.” The couple had got married in August 2010. On January 17, 2014, Sunanda was found dead in a Delhi hotel suite she was sharing with her husband. Empty Alprax (alprazolam) strips were found by her bedside and sources told the cops she had been taking the anti-depressant tablets. In January 2015, then Delhi police commissioner B.S. Bassi had claimed Sunanda was murdered and cited “poisoning” as the cause of death, giving the case a sensational turn considering the police’s failure to attribute any motive, the inability to identify the poison and contradictory medical and forensic reports. An AIIMS team that had done the first post-mortem had said alprazolam overdose was the cause of death. In April 2014, the Central Forensic Science Laboratory in Hyderabad had denied that poisoning was the cause of death before making a U-turn seven months later after being asked to do a second test. But it didn’t identify the poison. Delhi police later sent the viscera to the FBI following a nod from the home ministry. In January 2016, the US agency concluded that Sunanda died of an overdose of alprazolam. A medical board formed with AIIMS experts to study the FBI report said: “The circumstantial recovery of empty Alprax tablets (27 tablets) and report of the FBI, which shows the presence of Alprax in stomach and its contents, spleen, liver section, half of each kidney, blood sample, as well as urine wet clothing, bed cover and bed sheet confirmed the death is due to excessive ingestion of tablet alprazolam.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-301
19-08-2021||India||Women’s wing stands up to IUML||The women’s campus wing of the Indian Union Muslim League, frozen for speaking out against misogyny and sexually explicit comments by some leaders of the male counterpart, has made it clear it will not surrender to patriarchy. The IUML had on Tuesday frozen Haritha — the women’s wing of party student arm Muslim Students’ Federation — after its leaders refused to withdraw a complaint lodged with the Kerala women’s commission alleging harassment by male MSF leaders. Ten Haritha leaders, including its president, secretary and treasurer, had lodged the complaint against MSF state president P.K. Navas and Malappuram district general secretary V. Abdul Vahab. The women accused them of using sexually derogatory words during a state leadership meeting in Kozhikode on June 22. The police have since booked a case based on a direction from the women’s commission. The IUML, a constituent of the Opposition front UDF, has sent showcause notices to the two accused and asked them to respond within 15 days. While the Haritha leaders have desisted from speaking on the issue in public, Fathima Thahliya, national vice-president of the MSF and former president of Haritha, openly backed her colleagues and their allegations. “Our women leaders, including me, have been facing character assassination and abusive comments on social media because we stood up against such behaviour,” Thahliya told a news conference in Kozhikode on Wednesday. P.M.A. Salam, state general secretary of the IUML who has been assigned to look into the matter, told reporters there was no going back on the decision to freeze Haritha. “It’s the final decision. Now there will be talks (within the party),” he said. “Our doors are open for discussion, but party discipline is very important.” Salam said that once the accused had replied to the showcause notice, appropriate action would follow. Party lawmaker M.K. Muneer said the Haritha leaders should have spoken to party leaders first. “They should have been open for discussion. Instead they went to the women’s commission, which immediately got the police to file a case,” he said. He chided the accused MSF leaders for providing ammunition to political rivals “by using abusive language”.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-301
19-08-2021||India||Odisha govt to sponsor Indian hockey teams for 10 more years ||Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Tuesday announced that the state government will sponsor the men and women national hockey teams for another 10 years. The chief minister made the announcement while felicitating members of Tokyo-returned men and women hockey teams at the state secretariat. The teams have done the country proud with their performance at the Tokyo Olympics with the men’s team winning a bronze medal after 41 years and the women’s team reaching the semi-finals for the first time. The Odisha government is the official sponsor of both the men and women’s national hockey teams. It has been sponsoring the Indian hockey teams since 2018 with the contract valid till 2023. Now with the chief minister extending it for another 10 years it will run till 2033. Sources said Odisha would spend more than Rs 200 crore on the sponsorship in the next 10 years. Congratulating the teams for their effort to revive Indian hockey, Naveen said: “For nearly four decades, the hockey fans have been yearning to see India grab a medal at the Olympics. The way the entire country was glued to the TV screens to watch the hockey matches, it is quite evident there is something more to hockey than just sports.” Stating that Odisha and hockey are destined to become synonymous, Naveen said: “We will continue our partnership with Hockey India. Odisha will support the Indian hockey teams for 10 more years. This will herald a new era of Indian Hockey and bring back the glory to the nation.” Each player was awarded Rs 10 lakh and each support staff was awarded Rs 5 lakh by the chief minister. Both the teams gifted a framed jersey autographed by the players to the chief minister as a memento. The chief minister also gave away 13 awards. In the men’s team, Harmanpreet Singh won the award for the player with maximum number of goals. Men’s team goalkeeper P.R. Sreejesh won the award for the player who saved the maximum number of goals. In the women’s team, Gurjit Kaur and Vandana Katariya won the award for player with maximum number of goals. Few other players were awarded for their performances. Each was awarded Rs 5 lakh. Naveen also felicitated president, Hockey India, Gyanendro Ningombam, secretary general, Hockey India, Rajinder Singh, CEO, Hockey India, Elena Norman and the entire Hockey India staff and announced a reward of Rs 50 lakh to the Federation. Naveen also felicitated Odia doctor Col. (DR). Bibhu Kalyan Nayak who was appointed as the first Indian FIH Medical Officer for the Tokyo Olympics and awarded him Rs 5 lakh at the ceremony. All the hockey players and President, Indian Olympic Association Dr Narinder D. Batra recognised the support of Odisha. “Odisha has played a major role and it’s because of its support, we are seeing the results today. We assure that the graph of the Hockey will not go down,” said Batra. At the function at the state secretariat, all officials including private secretary to chief minister V.K. Pandian were present. Hockey in India saw revival after the Odisha government came forward when Sahara India backed out in 2018 from sponsorship of the national teams. The state had shot into international focus when it successfully organised the Men’s Hockey World Cup in Bhubaneswar in 2018. It is going to host the Men’s Hockey World Cup in 2023 as well for the second consecutive time. Odisha is the only state of the country promoting the game in this manner. Indian hockey women’s team captain Rani Rampal praised Odisha’s love for the game. “Hockey is in the heart of Odisha people and the love that Odisha has given is exemplary. Other states and institutions should learn what Odisha has done for the development of sport.

19-08-2021||West Bengal||SC Collegium elevates Calcutta HC judge caught in Mamata's crosshairs||Kaushik Chanda, an Additional Judge of the Calcutta High Court whom the Supreme Court Collegium has appointed as a Permanent Judge, was in West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's line of fire over his alleged proximity to the BJP and the TMC leader had even opposed his confirmation. Justice Chanda had on July 7 recused himself from hearing a petition by the Trinamool Congress chief challenging the election of Leader of the Opposition in the West Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari from Nandigram after she expressed apprehension of bias against her by the judge. The Collegium headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana met on August 17 and approved the proposal. The statement was uploaded on the apex court's website on Thursday. Besides Ramana, Justices U U Lalit and A M Khanwilkar are part of the three-member Collegium which takes decisions with regard to the appointment of high court judges. Seeking reassignment of her election petition to another bench, Banerjee's counsel had also written to the Acting Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court, saying the chief minister "had objected to the confirmation of the Hon'ble Judge as a Permanent Judge of the Hon'ble High Court at Calcutta", and as such, apprehends that there is a likelihood of bias on the part of the judge concerned. While recusing himself from the case, Justice Chanda had imposed a cost of Rs five lakh on Banerjee for the manner in which she had sought his recusal. He had noted in the order that Banerjee sought his recusal "since she apprehends that her objection against my confirmation as a Permanent Judge of this court is known to me", and maintained that in his view, such a ground cannot justify recusal. The petitioner cannot seek recusal based upon her own consent or objection with regard to the appointment of a judge, the bench said, adding that a judge cannot be said to be biased because of a litigant's own perception and action. "If such an argument is accepted, the election petition cannot be tried before this court since the petitioner, in her capacity as the Chief Minister of the State, has either objected or gave consent to the appointments of most of the Hon'ble Judges of this Court," Justice Chanda had said. In his order, Justice Chanda had noted that a letter by the petitioner's counsel to the Acting Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court on June 16 seeking that the election petition be reassigned to another judge "contained highly confidential information concerning the appointment of a Judge of the High Court, and the petitioner, being the Chief Minister of the State, who took the oath of secrecy, was constitutionally obliged to maintain the secrecy of such information." Releasing the election petition of Banerjee on an application by her for recusal expressing apprehension of bias, Justice Chanda said that he was doing so in order to thwart at the outset attempts by trouble-mongers to keep the controversy alive. He had noted that like any other citizen of the country a judge also exercises his voting rights in favour of a political party, but he lays aside his individual predilection while deciding a case. He had said that it is preposterous to suggest that a judge having a past association with a political party as a lawyer should not receive a case involving the said political party or any of its members. "The past association of a judge with a political party by itself cannot form apprehension of bias," the bench said. "This proposition, if allowed to be accepted, would be destructive to the long-lived and deep-rooted notion of neutrality associated with the justice delivery system and lead to the unfair practice of Bench hunting to resist a fair adjudication by an unscrupulous litigant," Justice Chanda observed. Noting that "the script was already prepared; the dramatis personae were ready to launch a well-rehearsed drama outside the Court," Justice Chanda said, "On the own showing of the petitioner in the recusal application, it appears that the chief national spokesperson and leader of the petitioner's party in the Rajya Sabha was ready by that time with two photographs of mine attending a programme of BJP legal cell in the year 2016." Justice Chanda said that another member of Parliament of the said party also by that time, apparently, "was ready with a purported list of cases where I had appeared for the Bharatiya Janata Party as a lawyer." Banerjee's lawyers had suggested that Justice Chanda should recuse himself from the case since he was associated with the legal cell of the BJP before his elevation as a judge and had appeared in a number of cases on its behalf before the high court as a lawyer. Congress leader and Supreme Court advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the TMC supremo, had submitted that "the Hon'ble Judge of this Hon'ble Court should be like Caesar's wife, above suspicion".||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-127

19-08-2021||West Bengal||High court orders CBI probe into post-poll violence in Bengal ||The Calcutta High Court on Thursday ordered a CBI probe into violence that allegedly took place in the aftermath of the announcement of the West Bengal Assembly poll results on May 2, and also constituted a special investigation team comprising serving IPS officers of the state. A five-judge bench headed by acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal, that was ruling on a clutch of petitions seeking an impartial probe into alleged atrocities like murder and crimes against women, also clarified that the court would monitor the progress of investigations. "It shall be a court-monitored investigation and any obstruction in the course of investigation by anyone shall be viewed seriously,” the court added. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has vehemently denied occurrence of any  post-poll violence in the state and also accused the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), which had submitted a scathing report, of doing the bidding of the ruling BJP at the Centre. A committee set up by NHRC had also recommended a CBI probe into the complaints of murder and rape, adding that these should be tried outside the state. “All cases as per the report of NHRC committee where allegations are about murder of person or crime against women regarding rape or attempt to rape shall be referred to the CBI for investigation,” the court ordered. The court also asked the state government to hand over all documents and records related to the cases to the CBI. As per the court, the three-member SIT will comprise Suman Bala Sahoo, director general of police (telecommunication), Soumen Mitra, Commissioner of Police Calcutta, and Ranvir Kumar, additional director general of police (administration-I). A retired Supreme Court judge will be appointed by the court later to monitor the working of the SIT. The bench of Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talukdar passed three separate but concurring judgements. Following cases of alleged atrocities in which many supporters were allegedly forced to flee their homes with police refusing to step in, a PIL was filed before the Calcutta High Court. Acting on the orders of the Calcutta High Court, a seven-member team formed by NHRC chairperson Justice Arun Mishra visited a number of areas across the state to probe the allegations. The 50-page report submitted by the committee had said that the "law of ruler" had replaced "rule of law" in Bengal. But, Mamata and other Trinamul leaders had questioned the neutrality of the NHRC. The Court also said that the July 2, 2021 notice issued to the deputy commissioner of police (South Suburban) seeking an explanation why proceedings for contempt of court against him should not be initiated, would  be taken up at a later date. The case will now be placed before a division bench for dealing with other issues mentioned in the NHRC report. The next hearing of the case is scheduled for October 4.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-127
19-08-2021||West Bengal||Trinamul puts ex-BJP face at helm of Jaigaon Development Authority||A number of Trinamul leaders of Alipurduar district, including a former BJP face and a former MLA of its own party, have been nominated as office-bearers and members of two prominent development bodies of north Bengal. Ganga Prasad Sharma, a former district president of the BJP who deserted the saffron camp after the Assembly elections this year and joined Trinamul, has been made the new chairman of Jaigaon Development Authority (JDA). Formed during the Left Front era, the JDA is tasked with infrastructure development in and around Jaigaon, the town in Alipurduar at the India-Bhutan border. Alipurduar is one of those few districts where Trinamul could not win a single Assembly seat at the elections this year despite its historic majority. Sourav Chakroborty, the immediate past MLA of Alipurduar, will chair the Siliguri-Jalpaiguri Development Authority (SJDA) headquartered at Siliguri. “It seems the party leadership wants Chakraborty to play a prominent role, given his contribution in establishing the party’s base in Alipurduar,” said a party leader. Sharma, on the other hand, seems to have earned the berth of the JDA chairman as Trinamul intends to use him to revive its support base, observers said. “During his (Sharma’s) tenure as the district president, the BJP managed to bag the Lok Sabha seat and also all the five Assembly seats of the district. His decision to quit the party has caused some damage to the BJP,” an observer said. Sharma’s selection has also brought cheers among the business fraternity of Jaigaon. A local resident, he is perceived to be aware of the issues that need to be addressed for its development. “I will soon hold a meeting with different organisations of Jaigaon and prepare a list of infrastructure work required to be done,” said Sharma. Tribal faces like Birendra Bara and Jai Prakash Toppo have been inducted in the JDA. Mihir Dutta, a former councillor of Alipurduar municipality, is also included.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-127
19-08-2021||West Bengal||Bimal Gurung faction to erect 11 martyrs’ statues killed during 2017 Gorkhaland agitation ||The Bimal Gurung faction of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has decided to erect statues of “11 martyrs killed during the Gorkhaland agitation in 2017” and has asserted that the party would move ahead with a Gorkhaland-centric agenda. Gurung chaired the central committee meeting held in Kalimpong on Wednesday, where many decisions to strengthen the faction were taken. Roshan Giri, general secretary of the faction, made it clear that it would once again use the Gorkhaland card to strengthen its base in the region. “It has been decided that the party will erect statues of 11 martyrs who died in the Gorkhaland agitation (of 2017)…. In the days to come we will move ahead with our issue, a Gorkhaland-centric agenda,” said Giri. The 2017 Gorkhaland agitation included 104 days of continuous strike in the hills. With the state government crushing the agitation with a heavy hand, Gurung along with Giri and his other senior leaders were on the run for over three years. Gurung returned to Darjeeling last year after dumping the BJP and joining hands with the Trinamul. Giri on Wednesday lambasted the BJP for “not being serious” about the hill issue and said any tripartite talk without taking the state government “on board” would be fruitless. “Our demand is Gorkhaland or Union territory. The other options of a hill body with legislative powers are Article 244A for which the Constitution has to be amended,” said Giri adding that the Sixth Schedule status had been rejected by the hill people. Observers in the hills believe Gurung’s faction, which did not fare well in the 2021 Bengal Assembly election in the hills, has little option but to “speak about the emotive Gorkhaland issue” to stay relevant. “In the present political landscape of the hills, I do not see the possibility of Gurung starting a movement for Gorkhaland but he may keep talking about the issue to attract supporters,” said an observer. Gurung’s rise in hill politics in 2007 was after he raised the Gorkhaland issue to oppose GNLF leader Subash Ghisingh’s demand for inclusion of hills within the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. At the meeting Gurung’s party also decided to bifurcate Kurseong subdivision committee into Kurseong 1 and 2 and two from subdivisional committees for Bijanbari area in Darjeeling and Gorubathan and Kumai-Jhaldhaka areas in Kalimpong district. The party also decided to form three committees for eastern, western and middle Dooars and appointed a number of leaders to oversee the party’s expansion in the plains including Siliguri and Terai, and decided to open a “human rights” cell. On Wednesday, Darjeeling MP Raju Bista of the BJP also visited Kalimpong to inaugurate an Aadhaar Seva Kendra.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-128
19-08-2021||West Bengal||Presence of BJP faces at Visva-Bharati event raises questions||Visva-Bharati on Wednesday was mired in controversy yet again after the BJP’s Birbhum unit chief and other BJP workers took part in a varsity event with junior Union education minister Subhas Sarkar, the saffron party’s Bankura MP. The presence of BJP faces at the varsity event raised questions over whether it was another attempt by Visva-Bharati authorities in the tenure of vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty to saffronise Rabindranath Tagore’s campus. Sarkar visited Visva-Bharati after his elevation as Union minister of state in the Narendra Modi government. He offered a floral tribute to Tagore’s chair at Rabindra Bhavana and visited sites connected with the polymath, before attending a lecture on the Centre’s National Education Policy organised by Visva-Bharati. BJP district chief Dhruba Saha, the party’s MLA from Birbhum’s Dubrajpur Anup Saha and other party workers accompanied Sarkar everywhere, including the varsity  lecture. The presence of BJP leaders in Visva-Bharati’s official event prompted Trinamul to question Chakrabarty’s alleged attempts to saffronise the central varsity with the Prime Minister as chancellor. BJP district chief Saha was on the dais of the lecture by Sarkar with VC Chakrabarty. “A minister may come, but why was the BJP district president in the programme? The VC is actively working to promote the BJP and has turned it (the varsity) into a camp of that party. Now, Trinamul will also organise a political programme inside the varsity,” said Trinamul’s Birbhum unit chief Anubrata Mondal. “The VC has no right to invite political leaders to a varsity programme.” Many varsity insiders said this was not a first at the varsity and the trend began in Chakrabarty’s time. In 2019, the alleged promotion of saffronisation began by allowing the Rashtriya Kala Manch, an RSS-backed outfit, to hold a workshop in the varsity’s journalism department. In August 2019, ABVP national-secretary Sunil Ambekar and then state tourism minister Gautam Deb of Trinamul, became the first political leaders to be invited to Halakarshana (ploughing ceremony), started by Tagore in 1929, on Sriniketan campus. In January 2020, Visva-Bharati organised a lecture to support the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act of the Modi government by Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta, despite student protests. “Since Chakrabarty came here as the VC, he has been proactively trying to promote the saffron agenda... a desperate bid to ruin the inclusive, secular, cosmopolitan, global culture of Visva-Bharati, built painstakingly by Tagore,” said a senior varsity professor. Asked about the presence of BJP leaders in the varsity’s event, Sarkar said: “They are human beings too.” “They came to Visva-Bharati as human beings. Those who came here are educated and did not come here to do politics,” he added. BJP district chief Saha said he was a “lover of Tagore”, which is why he was there. The controversy over the presence of BJP leaders in educational institutions continued in Durgapur, where Sarkar went to inaugurate a digital classroom and a library of the National Institute of Technology (NIT) in the afternoon. Sources said a BJP leaders were there to welcome him, which was unprecedented for the national institution. Sarkar claimed all those who came to the NIT were involved in education and had no connection with politics.

19-08-2021||West Bengal||Over 30 lakh already applied for cash assistance: Mamata Banerjee||Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said a total of 30 lakh women had already applied for Lakshmir Bhandar scheme that offers Rs 500 each to general caste women and Rs 1,000 each to SC/ST women every month through Duare Sarkar camps that started on Monday. “Thirty lakh women have already applied for the Lakshmir Bhandar scheme... In some areas, many are gathering to fill up forms. I would request all to have patience as the camps would continue till September 15,” the chief minister said after an administrative review meeting at Nabanna on Wednesday. Sources said the rush to apply for Lakshmir Bhandar was encouraging for the ruling establishment as it proved that the scheme could be a game changer ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, but at the same time the huge gathering at the camps was giving a headache for the state administration in the backdrop of the pandemic. “The main problem is that Covid-19 protocols have been thrown out of gear at many camps. We are concerned because we don’t want these camps to trigger the third wave of the pandemic in Bengal,” said a senior official. Considering the huge gatherings at the camps, chief secretary H.K. Dwivedi has asked district magistrates to increase the number of camps. Initially, it was planned that 17,000-odd camps would be set up under the month-long programme, but now it has been decided that 22,000-odd camps would be launched to avert large gatherings. The chief minister said 46 lakh applications had already been received in the first three days of the Duare Sarkar camps. “Maximum number of applications have been submitted seeking benefits under the Lakshmir Bhandar programme.... It is very natural that many people would apply for a new scheme,” she said. According to sources, the initial trend of the Duare Sarkar camps gives a clear trend that the number of applications under the scheme would surpass the state government’s initial assessment. “Initially, we had estimated that 1.6 crore beneficiaries would be registered under the new scheme. But now, it appears the number of beneficiaries would be much more,” said a senior official. Sources at Nabanna said the success of the Duare Sarkar camps clearly suggested that the target of the government to reach out to common people had clicked. “Now, the top brass of the government are keen on holding the programme twice a year,” said a source.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-128

19-08-2021||West Bengal||Union minister Subhash Sarkar courts controversy with remarks on Rabindranath Tagore's complexion||Union minister of state for education Subhash Sarkar produced a shocker on Wednesday when he dwelt on the skin tone of Rabindranath Tagore in public at Visva-Bharati, the central university founded by the Bard. Instead of discussing the woes facing the Indian education system or how to bridge the digital divide to ensure that more students could attend online classes, the minister gave a lecture on different types of fair skin and explained why Sarada Devi hadn’t purportedly taken her son Tagore on her lap in his childhood. “Tar maa ebong barir oneke kalo boley take koley niten na. Sei Rabindranath Thakur bharoter hoye biswa joy korechhen (His mother and some other family members didn’t take him on their lap because he was dark. That Rabindranath Tagore conquered the world for India),” Sarkar said at a lecture organised by the varsity during his first visit after his induction into the Narendra Modi cabinet. Sarkar was silent on where he sourced the titbits of racial discrimination in the Tagore family. Nor did he offer any correlation between Tagore’s success and skin tone, which he portrayed as a disadvantage. During his three-hour stay at the abode of Tagore, Sarkar, with Visva Bharati vice chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty by his side, spoke on several issues, ranging from the situation in Afghanistan to the New Education Policy. But the comments of the gynaecologist-turned-politician on the skin tone of the Bard and other members of the Tagore family stumped everyone. “Kabiguru Rabindranath Thakur samporke, eder barite sokoler chehara jodi dekha jai, sokoler gayer rong dhobdhobe forsha chhilo. Rabindranath Thakurer o gayer rang satyikarer forsha chhilo. Farsa sadharanato dui prokarer hoi — ekjon dekhben toktokey holdey, ar ekjon dekhben forshar modhyei kintu ektu laal bhab thake. Kabiguru Rabindranath Thakurer gayer rong dwitiyo dhoroner chhilo, (If I talk about Rabindranath Tagore, if we look into the faces of all his family members, everyone’s complexion was extremely fair. Tagore was also really fair. There are two categories of fairness — a person with extreme yellow skin tone and you may find the other type of fairness with a reddish tinge. Tagore belonged to second category),” said Sarkar. Several experts on Tagore drilled holes into his assessment of Tagore’s skin tone, but the bigger question was what prompted him to bring skin tone of the legend in public discourse. “When a BJP central minister talks about skin tone, it exposes the deep-rooted racism in his mind. The Prime Minister and other senior leaders of the party should condemn his statement,” said CPM leader Sujan Chakraborty. “They divide the country in terms of religion and caste.… Now, they have began bringing skin tone in the discourse,” he added, expressing his dismay at how the BJP was trying to divide the society. Later in the day, Sarkar told journalists in Bankura that he had documents to prove whatever he had said on the Bard’s skin colour. But some of his colleagues in the BJP expressed surprise over his comments. “The comments on skin tone of Tagore were unnecessary… We could have avoided this controversy at a time awareness of colour prejudices is growing at least in urban India,” said a senior state BJP leader on condition of anonymity. Last July, Hindustan Unilever had changed the name of Fair & Lovely, a skin-lightening product, to Glow & Lovely. The modification captured an attempt to do away with racial stereotyping against which worldwide protests erupted after the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis police in the United States. More than a year after an FMCG behemoth made an effort to align its marketing policy towards a more inclusive vision of beauty, and several other brands followed suit, Sarkar’s comments were seen as regressive. “If a Union minister talks about skin tone and portrays someone like Tagore as dark and then refers it as a disadvantage, you can well imagine that he is reinforcing the racial stereotype,” said a professor of Visva-Bharati. Some Tagore experts said although the bard himself, and even his nephew Abanindranath Tagore, had often described themselves as ‘dark’, it was more in jest while referring to their childhood memories. “Tagore was very fair and handsome and there was no doubt that he was definitely a fair one. My father Bijan Bihari Bhattacharya worked with Tagore at least for 10 years from 1931 as he was one of the editors of Rabindra Rachanabali. I heard from my father that he was fair and handsome. I also heard it from many people who met Tagore personally,” said Amitra Sudan Bhattacharya, a Tagore researcher and author. According to him, the minister’s assessment of Tagore’s skin tone was wrong. Academic Pabitra Sarkar said word “dark” was very relative and it was very shameful when a minister discussed the complexion of Tagore in front of seniors at the varsity. “It is wrong that his mother or others did not take him on their lap. His mother used to cuddle the kids before they went to bed. Is there any relation with Rabindranath whom we know with his skin complexion? Did such issues stop Tagore from becoming a Nobel prize winner or a philosopher or polymath? It is shameful that a minister will speak about such things like a child in front of the matured people.” Trinamul vice-president Saugata Ray also criticised Sarkar. “This reminds of what Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar had said: ‘Murkheyr awshesh dosh (the faults of the idiot are endless)’. Subhash Sarkar, I don’t know him very well. He is a first-time MP, and a minister now… But if he does make such remarks, he should not be allowed to enter Visva-Bharati henceforth.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-128
19-08-2021||West Bengal||Nearly 200 Bengal residents stuck in Afghanistan, says Mamata Banerjee||Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said nearly 200 people from Bengal were stranded in Afghanistan and her government was in touch with the Centre to evacuate them safely. “We have received information so far that about 200 people from the state are stranded in Afghanistan. Our chief secretary has written a letter to the external affairs ministry, urging the Centre to rescue them at the earliest,” the chief minister said after an administrative review meeting at Nabanna on Wednesday. The Bengal government had asked all district magistrates on Tuesday to take initiatives to find out whether any person from the state was stuck in Afghanistan. The directive came after the state did not receive any information officially about any such person even though social media platforms were flooded with details of many Bengal residents stuck in Afghanistan. “As soon as the DMs played proactive roles, the state government received information that more than 200 people were stranded in Afghanistan. The chief secretary wrote the letter to Delhi without any delay,” said a source. Sources said the message had been sent to the districts on Tuesday after Nabanna had come to know that some persons from the state, particularly the Darjeeling hills, were stranded in Afghanistan and they needed immediate evacuation following Taliban’s takeover of the country. The state government had told the DMs that in case they received any information of persons stranded in Afghanistan, they should send a report to Nabanna along with the details like phone number, current location and contact person in Bengal. The sources said Nabanna had become active on the issue after reports came in that some family members in Darjeeling had approached local BJP MP Raju Bista to take initiatives to evacuate their family members in Afghanistan. Bista, who reached Darjeeling on Tuesday, said a committee headed by a joint secretary in the ministry of external affairs was being formed to oversee the evacuation of Indians stuck in Afghanistan. A bureaucrat said on Wednesday: “Soon after the state received details of nearly 200 persons, steps were initiated to draw the attention of the Centre.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-128

Although rescue operations of the state civil defence department and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) are on, none of the trio could be traced till evening. Sources said around 10am, four sons of Lakshman Mandal, a farmer in Chor-Sujapur, Baishnabnagar, with fields in Krishnapur on the other side of the river, were in the boat on the Ganga. The small vessel with Indrajit, 25, Subrata, 22, Satyajit, 19, and Satyaban, 17, could not keep its balance in the severe current of the overflowing river and capsized. Only Indrajit, a farmer like his father, could swim ashore. Subrata is a third-year student of South Malda College while Satyajit and Satyaban have passed their higher secondary exams this year. “They went to harvest jute stems. We never expected such a mishap,” said the father. A civil defence team started a search operation with 12 country boats, trained swimmers and a speed boat. Later, an NDRF team joined in.“None could be traced till late evening,” said Mamun Akhtar, the BDO of Kaliachak-III block. Residents said many villages of Kaliachak-III block are flooded by the Ganga .The main road used by commuters in these villages to reach block headquarters is under water. “A boat is the only medium of transport.

19-08-2021||West Bengal||Nothing can stop Tripura win, says Mamata Banerjee||Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday asserted that the Trinamul Congress would come to power in Tripura after the 2023 Assembly polls despite alleged efforts by the BJP government in the northeastern state to thwart her party’s rise there. “We cannot be stopped like this. Tripura, we will win next,” the Bengal chief minister said when she was asked at a press conference about alleged harassment of Trinamul leaders in Tripura. “Because we want the Bengal schemes to start in Tripura. Tripura’s people, too, should get the same benefits… we want the people of Tripura too to stay well,” she added. The questions at the press meet at Nabanna were in reference to the latest allegations from Trinamul youth wing chief Saayoni Ghosh. In a series of tweets, the actor-turned politician alleged hours of power cuts at a hotel where she and other Trinamul leaders stayed in Tripura, ill-treatment by the management, disallowing political discussions in its restaurant and even sub-standard food being served to Trinamul leaders. The Bengal chief minister said: “They are not even allowing them to stay in hotels, there too they are disturbing them.” “This is too much. There isn’t even the d of democracy, the l of loktantra … of law and order, neither is there order, nor law. Totally out of order. Goondaism, vandalism is on.” Mamata said former Speaker of the Tripura Assembly Jiten Sarkar — with stints in several political parties in the state — wrote to her, expressing his intention to join Trinamul, along with several others. She said the letter had been forwarded to her nephew, Trinamul’s national general-secretary Abhishek Banerjee. Referring to the alleged attack on Trinamul MPs Dola Sen and Aparupa Poddar in Tripura on Sunday — the latest in a series of such incidents in the northeastern state — Mamata said she didn’t want to get into all the details. “Whatever violence they have been perpetrating is for all to see. Head injuries to the (Bengal) police, head injuries to women MPs,” said the Trinamul chief. “Our party sought time from the governor (of Tripura, Satyadev Narayan Arya), which wasn’t given. It was said that time would be given after August 15. But the governor here (Jagdeep Dhankhar), the BJP’s leaders go and sit with him every day. Sorry to say,” she added. “Our governor (Dhankhar) gives more time to them (the BJP, the Opposition in Bengal). It has to be said that our governor is good. That is why he gives the BJP time every day. Every evening, he sits down for discussions with them.” On Wednesday, the High Court of Tripura refused to stay the operation of a suo motu FIR filed by Khowai police, accusing six Trinamul leaders, including Abhishek, of obstructing public servants from discharging their duty. A bench of Chief Justice A.A. Kureshi also directed the police to continue with their investigation but not to file the final report without the leave of the court. The court passed the order after hearing a petition filed by Subal Bhowmik to stay the investigation and also quash the case registered against him.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-128

The total number of active cases in the state fell by 21 to 9,715, after an uninterrupted 59 days of slide. Bengal now has 2.71 per cent of the national total of active cases, and is sixth among states with most such cases. Calcutta logged 86 new cases and zero deaths on Wednesday. With North 24-Parganas logging 88 cases, Wednesday was the 13th consecutive day of no Bengal district reporting a three-digit figure of new cases. Seventeen districts reported two-digit figures, Kalimpong, North and South Dinajpur, Malda, Birbhum and Purulia single-digit figures. The state’s recovery rate is 98.18 per cent, its highest ever this pandemic, still fairly ahead of the national rate of 97.51. The daily positive confirmation rate, nearly 33 per cent at the peak of the second wave, was 1.47 per cent on Wednesday. Seventeen Bengal districts, including Calcutta, reported zero deaths on Wednesday. Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Bankura, West Midnapore and Hooghly reported one each. The state’s mortality rate is 1.19 per cent now, while that of the nation is 1.34. Bengal now has over 15.4 lakh Covid-19 cases, since the first was reported in March last year. The total includes 15.12 lakh recoveries and 18,325 deaths.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-128
19-08-2021||North East||Tripura BJP MLA asks members to attack TMC workers in 'Talibani' manner||A ruling BJP MLA in Tripura, Arun Chandra Bhowmik, has stoked a controversy by allegedly saying that his party activists should counter Trinamul Congress leaders in Talibani style if they land at Agartala airport. The saffron camp, however, said it is the MLA's version and not that of the BJP. With an eye on the Tripura Assembly polls in 2023, TMC leaders, including its national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, are visiting the hilly state frequently to try and build a base and an organisation for the party which till now has been confined to Bengal. The TMC is trying to harm the Biplab Kumar Deb-led government in Tripura that came to power by ending the 25-year-long Communist rule. All these are happening due to the instigation of Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, the legislator who represents Belonia constituency said. Bhowmik made this remark Wednesday during a felicitation ceremony for newly inducted Union minister of state for Social Justice and Empowerment, Pratima Bhowmik at Belonia old town hall in South Tripura district. "I appeal to all of you that we need to attack them in Talibani style. We need to attack them once they land at the airport here. We will protect our government led by Biplab Kumar Deb with every drop of blood," he said. A video clip of his comments went viral on the social media inviting wide criticism. Reacting to his remarks, Tripura TMC leader Subal Bhowmik demanded the BJP MLA's arrest. Bengal TMC leaders were harassed last night at a private hotel in Agartala where they are staying. The incident happened after the MLA made this provocative remark, he claimed. BJP Tripura chief spokesperson Subrata Chakraborty said the comment made by Bhowmik is exclusively his own and the party does not take any responsibility. It is entirely his responsibility. This is not the culture of BJP, Chakraborty told PTI. When contacted, Bhowmik said he had made the remark as an example to justify how to counter the TMC seriously. "I used the word 'Talibani' to make it clear that the way the Trinamul Congress is trying to harm the BJP government in Tripura, it needs a strong reaction. Use of the word Talibani' might have sent a wrong message, but my intention was just to narrate how to counter them seriously," the BJP legislator said. Clashes between the TMC and the BJP have been reported from Tripura over the past few weeks. On his first visit, TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee's convoy was allegedly attacked by BJP workers in Tripura on August 3. The TMC had claimed that two of its youth leaders from Bengal sustained injuries after being attacked by BJP workers in Dhalai district of the north-eastern state on August 7. The TMC alleged that two of its MPs -Dola Sen and Aparupa Poddar were attacked twice by BJP supporters in South Tripura district on Independence Day. The saffron party, however, has denied the allegations, saying the TMC posed no threat to them in the state.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-9
19-08-2021||North East||Centre gives Rs 1,352.92cr to NE to bolster Covid management||The Centre has allotted Rs 1,352.92 crore to the northeastern states to further bolster Covid-19 management in the region which bore the brunt of the now-tapering second wave of the pandemic. Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, who was in Guwahati on Tuesday to review the pandemic management of the northeastern states with health ministers and senior health officials, announced the financial package to aggressively strengthen the health infrastructure to effectively fight Covid-19. Assam got more than 50 per cent of the allotted amount. Mandaviya later tweeted the break-up of the funds allotted to each state with Assam, which has double the population of the other seven states combined, getting the highest Rs 812.46 crore and Sikkim the lowest Rs 21.85 crore. Arunachal Pradesh received Rs 141.94 crore, Nagaland Rs 62.46 crore, Meghalaya 91.94 crore, Tripura Rs 93.02 crore, Manipur Rs 85.95 crore and Mizoram Rs 44.3 crore. Those privy to the meeting said Mandaviya urged the states to meet their vaccination targets and move forward together to tackle the pandemic while assuring all possible help from the central government. He also suggested that infrastructure created for Covid management should be such that it could be used for treatment of non-Covid patients in the future. “The funds will help the states to procure medicines, create buffer stock, adequate stock of oxygen and creation of sufficient numbers of beds in hospitals at district and local levels, including ICUs. The Centre will ensure regular supply of vaccines to the Northeast so that the maximum number of people are vaccinated within the next few months,” Mandaviya told the media after the meeting. All the states made PowerPoint presentations on the Covid-19 situation, offered their suggestions on combating the pandemic and meeting vaccination targets at the shortest possible time and tackling a possible third wave. The Union minister was “hopeful” that the state governments are fully prepared and are equipped to thwart a possible third wave in the region. Mizoram and Manipur, which have suffered the most during the second wave, figured during the “in-depth discussions”. The health ministers of Assam, Sikkim, Mizoram and Nagaland were present at the review meeting along with the education minister of Tripura, adviser to the Manipur chief minister and senior officials of the health ministry. The day also saw Assam ease a few travel restrictions and reduce night curfew from 11 to 10 hours as Covid-19 cases continued to dip. Night curfew across Assam will be in force from 7pm to 5am, while inter-district travel has been allowed for private vehicles, except in Kamrup (metro). Gathering of 200 people has been allowed at public functions in open areas while 25 people can now attend weddings and funerals. An Assam government order said all incoming passengers, who have taken two doses of Covid-19 vaccines and possess a vaccination certificate, on production of the document in front of the screening authority, shall be exempted from mandatory testing on arrival at airports, railway stations, road border points, etc, provided they also possess a negative Covid test report of samples taken within 72 hours. Symptomatic passengers, however, will have to undergo mandatory RT-PCR testing at their own cost on arrival at airports and railway stations.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-9
19-08-2021||Opinion||Editorial: Sold off||Hawking used gunny sacks is not something school teachers are expected to do. The Bihar government, however, ordered teachers of government schools to do exactly that. The loss in revenue in the years 2014 to 2016 under the mid-day meal scheme was to be made up by teachers selling the sacks used to distribute food grains to schools at half the price of each. This amount was to be returned to the government. The money was calculated according to the number of sacks given to the schools in the designated years. Any teacher unable to return the amount for which he or she was responsible would be charged with embezzlement. The lack of respect underlying the order is not new, although the Bihar government’s stand is still outrageous. A principal who tried to make this obvious by hawking in the open market sacks that nobody was buying was suspended; his colleagues protested against both the suspension and the order. They emphasized the government’s disrespect and coercion, fearing that they themselves would have to pay for sacks that were torn, damaged by rats and floods, used by children without chairs to sit on. There never had been any scheme to return the sacks. Teachers in government schools are expected to serve the government besides teaching. A Central government rule kindly says that teachers should not be deployed for any non-educational activity except the census, disaster relief and election duties. These tasks in the national interest are time-consuming; they also allow the administration to take teachers for granted. So teachers are now in charge of mid-day meal systems in their schools, from buying ingredients to tasting the food, and maintaining accounts. They distributed dry rations to students during the pandemic; the reported number of deaths from the virus is staggering. Participating in surveys or the pulse polio campaign, even taking pictures of open defecation during the programme against it are, reportedly, other tasks. In 2019, a survey of five states showed that teachers taught for only 19.1 per cent of their time; the rest was given to non-academic duties. The Bihar incident is the extreme expression of a typical disrespect. It is a corollary of the administration’s indifference to foundational teaching. It is no use criticizing achievement levels if teachers are not allowed to teach.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-48
19-08-2021||Opinion||Letters to the editor:  India and England Test series||Remarkable victory Sir — The ongoing Test series of five matches between India and England has been nail-biting so far. The Indian team showed grit in the second Test at Lord’s, winning the match by 151 runs. On the final day of the match, it initially seemed that the game might swing in favour of the host country. India had declared its second innings at 298-8 just after lunch and set England a target of 272 runs in 60 overs, which seemed manageable. However, India’s strong fast-bowling unit — Mohammed Siraj, Jasprit Bumrah, Ishant Sharma and Mohammed Shami — turned the game on its head. This match will remain etched in the minds of cricket fans across the world. Having said that, the English skipper, Joe Root, must be congratulated for scoring an outstanding unbeaten run of 180 in the first innings. As both teams head into the third Test of the series, there is no doubt that cricket fans are in for a treat. Aditya Mukherjee,New Delhi Sir — The recently concluded Test match at Lord’s between England and India was certainly thrilling. The fifth day of the second Test started with India on the back foot. However, the Indian men’s team performed remarkably, ensuring a victory. It must be noted that only one other team in history has declared the third innings of a Test after lunch on the final day and won — New Zealand beat Sri Lanka at Kandy in 1984. While all players contributed to the Indian victory, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami deserve special mention. Hopefully, India will keep up the momentum and clinch a series victory. Abhiroop Sarkar,Birbhum Sir — The dramatic manner in which the Indian cricket team scripted victory against England at Lord’s reaffirms that the oldest format of the game is going to survive in spite of the popularity of Twenty20 and one-day internationals among the younger generation. Both teams played well with noteworthy performances from several players. Hopefully, many such unforgettable games will continue to delight us in the future. Rakesh Bajoria,Calcutta Hidden worries Sir — For the past few weeks, the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan has, rightly, captured the attention of the world. Many may thus not be aware that a devastating earthquake of 7.2 magnitude hit Haiti last Saturday. Nearly 2,000 people lost their lives and many others were severely injured. According to reports, 1.2 million people have been affected, but with rescue operations still underway, it will be a while before the actual scale of devastation can be comprehended. Haiti is currently battling a political crisis as well — the former president, Jovenel Moise, was assasinated last month at his residence. On top of all these troubles, the rescue operations have now been hindered by heavy rainfall. Unless other nations extend a helping hand, it will be difficult for the people of Haiti to recover from these problems. Jang Bahadur Singh,Jamshedpur Sir — The ongoing crisis in Haiti must not be overlooked. In the aftermath of the earthquake, countless families have lost access to shelter, safe water and food. The Caribbean nation, which already had a rickety infrastructure, is battling an earthquake in the midst of a pandemic. India must send aid to Haiti as soon as possible. Medha Parekh,Mumbai Unfair game Sir — The Calcutta-based couturier, Sabyasachi Mukherjee, has been embroiled in a controversy regarding his collaboration with the fast-fashion brand, H&M. Many are enraged that the designer known to promote Indian artisans failed to involve them in a project that claims, ironically, to be dedicated to Indian patterns and craftsmanship. Worse, the products were similar to ones that can be found in local markets at a tiny fraction of the price. This fiasco has laid bare, once again, the exploitation in the fashion industry. Should designers not be held accountable for fleecing both artisans and customers? Anamika Saha,Calcutta PARTING SHOT Sir — The mistreatment of elders has become one of the major problems of our times. Many people refuse to care for aged family members and leave them at old age homes. The latter often suffer physical abuse at the hands of their children. There is an urgent need for the government to provide senior citizens with a monthly pension so that, at the very least, they are not financially dependent on their children.

19-08-2021||Opinion||Editorial: Snaking line||It is possible that the compulsions of the New Great Game unfolding in Afghanistan and its neighbourhood have deflected global attention from the frightening scale of the humanitarian crisis that is gathering pace simultaneously. Some estimates put the number of internally displaced Afghans at 250,000, 80 per cent of whom are women and children. Another manifestation of this catastrophe is the steady stream of refugees seeking asylum in other countries. Pakistan and Iran host the highest number of Afghan refugees as mandated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. India, too, has been supportive of displaced Afghan citizens over the years: till July, around 15,467 asylum seekers were registered with UNHCR India, according to recent data. It is strange that a nation that has been forced by history and geography to play host to those seeking refuge — be it from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Tibet or Myanmar — is yet to draft a refugee policy of its own. Neither is India a signatory to the UN Convention of 1951 or the Protocol that followed later. There is a line of thought that argues that this enables New Delhi to respond to requests for asylum on a case-by-case basis. This flexibility, it is argued, is important when the issue is viewed from within the prism of national security. Yet it is equally true that the absence of a law can give the State room to behave in a discriminatory manner. For instance, the political rhetoric favoured by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Centre on the Rohingyas who were accommodated by India was one of subtle vilification. The Union home ministry has announced emergency visa that will permit Afghan applicants to stay in India for a mandated time period: this is welcome, even though periodic extensions in visas cannot be a substitute for citizenship that offers specific entitlements. Unfortunately, a tweet by the foreign minister, pledging to prioritize the welfare of Hindus and Sikhs from Afghanistan — the prime minister reportedly reiterated this point in a cabinet meeting — has also stoked concern that the present government may be selective in its benevolence. After all, the Centre has championed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which is discriminatory towards Muslims seeking shelter in India. Humanitarian assistance cannot be predicated upon identity or ideological considerations. With changes in India’s neighbourhood, there is a case for Parliament to legislate a law for refugees that is free of prejudice.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-48
19-08-2021||Opinion||Take charge of the climate problem||All of humanity contributes to the climate change problem. All of us alive at a given point in time consume, and our consumption has a carbon footprint. However, consumption is non-uniform — higher-income consumers have larger footprints, including carbon. Economic inequality and carbon inequality go hand-in-hand. Rich people in every country have contributed more to global warming than the poor. In fixing the problem, the rich must bear greater responsibility as well. Wealthy people everywhere must adopt lifestyle changes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but it is unlikely that they will do so on their own. Should the wealthy be coerced? Probably not. Then how do we bring about lifestyle changes among the wealthy that create a smaller footprint while, at the same time, increasing the consumption of the poorest to basic subsistence levels? How about letting the market address the problem of economic inequality and carbon inequality? Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary driver of global climate change. It is well accepted that to avoid the worst impact of climate change, the world needs to urgently reduce emissions. But global discussions regarding how this responsibility is to be shared have yielded little. Nor have courts across jurisdictions been able to usher in the required change in spite of a few judgments against governments and corporations. It is us, all individuals who consume, who need to be active participants in the solution, and not countries or corporations that have been the target of climate change negotiations and lawsuits. The current per capita carbon dioxide emission is 4.79 tonnes. For the sake of argument, let us presume that the members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agree to freeze per capita carbon dioxide emissions at this level, effective 2025, by when global carbon emissions must peak. During this intervening period, two things need to happen: a mechanism put in place to track every adult individual’s carbon dioxide emission, and the establishment of a global carbon trading platform for individuals, the ultimate consumers. The Paris Agreement target of a global average temperature rise well below two degrees Celsius by the end of this century is a political decision. In the last 11,700 years or so, humans have experienced a relatively stable environment with minor changes in climate and thrived like never before. In the northern and southern hemispheres, humans became accustomed to a narrow range of climatic variations of only about one degree Celsius up or down. Currently, we are just outside that range and the consequences are already severe. We would rather be within the one-degree Celsius variation band. Scientifically, it is possible to arrive at a per capita emissions quota to remain within the narrow variation band, adjusted periodically for a population rise and a fall sometime in the future. It is now technologically possible to track every individual, their consumption and, therefore, their carbon dioxide emissions. Think Aadhaar, think Pegasus. All those who are below the per capita quota can put up their unused carbon space as credits while all those who are above the cap can buy credits to offset their excess emissions. There could be nationally determined incentives and penalties of various forms for those with excess emissions for not participating in the market. For example, those who do not voluntarily agree to be tracked for emissions could be assigned default emissions that are two income slabs above, or those who do not comply, when detected, would be heavily penalized. Those below the per capita emissions quota would have a built-in incentive to participate in the market for financial gain. Governments could tax these transactions for public expenditure on mitigation and adaptation. All those who need to offset their excess emission would look for ways to reduce their footprint by refraining from over-cooling or over-heating homes or opting for energy services with the least footprint. They could take up walking and cycling, cut air travel and shift to diets with a higher share of plant-based protein, bringing about changes in lifestyle and consumer preference. Over time, economic and carbon inequalities would narrow as those who gain financially would increase their consumption as well as footprint. Some may even turn buyer from seller in the global carbon exchange, but the per capita emissions quota would hold. The idea may seem idealistic or even bizarre, but individuals need to take charge — it is their lives that are at stake. For the better part of human history, governments and corporations did not exist, yet the species survived. Yes, governments and corporations have made a big difference in human well-being, the greater good for the greatest numbers ever. However, the well-being of these entities cannot hold human beings hostage. We are in a situation where the institutions we created to serve us are demanding that we serve them. This cannot and should not be the case. I am not arguing that we jettison these institutions but rein them in to serve the purpose they are meant to serve.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-49
19-08-2021||Opinion||Trouble at the door||Since last Monday, the international media and countless social media handles have been juxtaposing the dramatic images of Afghans trying to clamber on to a military aircraft of the United States of America in Kabul airport with 46-year-old images of a line of Vietnamese civilians getting into a helicopter parked near the US embassy in Saigon. Both images have a common theme: American defeat. At the risk of anticipating developments, I would like to suggest that in the coming weeks and months, the images from Kabul are likely to be displayed alongside a very different set of photographs: the ball of fire engulfing the twin towers of New York City on September 11, 2001. This time, the message that will be conveyed will be significantly different: the triumph of jihad. The reasons for the abrupt collapse of the Afghan State that was established after the military defeat of the Taliban in 2002 in the ‘War on Terror’ have been subjected to a great deal of analysis. The profound global concern over the fate of Afghans, particularly Afghan women, who had invested in the creation of a modern country, adhering to internationally-accepted norms and even a form of imperfect democracy, has been coupled with a measure of anger directed at the US administration. With the benefit of hindsight, it is now acknowledged that the abrupt exit of the US and other Western troops had a devastating impact on the morale of the Afghan National Army and led it to yielding ground to the ragtag Taliban forces without a fight. Whether the announcement of withdrawal on April 14 by President Joe Biden was premised on an overestimation of the Ashraf Ghani regime’s capacity to hold out against the Taliban or was simply a reflection of a couldn’t-care-less attitude of a declining power is certain to be the subject of future debate. There will, however, be unanimity over the fact that the billions of dollars spent on building Afghan capacity didn’t yield the desired political results. Without America’s hand-holding, the entire edifice collapsed like a pack of cards. The despondency over the recapture of Afghanistan by the Taliban has been experienced all over the West and even in India, which, too, invested heavily in the building of a new Afghanistan. The focus is now likely to shift to the orderly rehabilitation of those Afghans who managed to get out of the country and concern for those Afghans whose social profile makes them anathema to the victorious Taliban. The example of post-1975 Vietnam suggests that the problem of Afghan refugees will preoccupy the West (and even India) in the coming years. There is, however, another issue that is, for the moment, being overlooked amid the unfolding human tragedy of Afghans who want to get the hell out of the resurrected Emirate. How is the re-conquest of Afghanistan being viewed by those who waged a doughty jihad against American, British and other Nato forces for the past 19 years? The issue is relevant because — at least until 2014 when the US and other powers reduced their boots on the ground drastically — the Taliban survived against formidable odds. The challenges that confronted the Taliban have been spelt out by Antonio Giustozzi in his well-researched book, The Taliban at War: 2001-2018. “During 2009-13 the Taliban stood against a much larger force, with the US contribution to the coalition amounting at one point to over 100,000 men. With US funds, the Afghan security forces increased to over 300,000 men by 2014, and US allies contributed tens of thousands of additional combat troops. The Taliban’s enemies, particularly the Americans, had immense superiority in terms of technology and firepower; airpower in particular inflicted heavy casualties on the Taliban. The Taliban mostly relied upon military technology from the 1950s, and had little or no anti-aircraft defences except heavy machine guns. During 2002-14 Taliban combat groups often took casualties averaging between 10-20 per cent yearly. By 2014, few of those who had entered the insurgency in the early years were still alive to tell the tale. Almost all still in the ranks, particularly in the elite mobile units, would have seen many of their comrades in arms blown to pieces. Whatever one might think of the Taliban and their cause, their resilience should not be in doubt.” Having interviewed scores of Taliban fighters, Giustozzi also observed: “The Taliban claim that their moral righteousness, in serving the cause of Islam, has allowed them to surmount all these challenges.” In short, as the larger consequences of the post-American world sink in, there is also likely to be a mythology that is certain to grow around the Taliban and their unflinching commitment to a jihad they believed in. For the moment, the visible celebrations over the Taliban victory may well be confined to some parts of Pakistan and in enclaves dominated by Palestinians. However, there is little doubt that the euphoria over the humiliation of America and the West is certain to generate a new wave of Muslim radicalization globally. In an incisive study written in 2005, Landscapes of the Jihad, the Oxford academic, Faisal Devji, had observed that Osama bin Laden’s “jihad is global not because it controls people, places and circumstances over vast distances, for Al-Qaeda’s control of such things is negligible... but for precisely the opposite reason: because it is too weak to participate in such a politics of control... [T]he global consequences of Al-Qaeda’s jihad have outstripped its local causes, and so have exceeded its intentions, to take on a life of their own well beyond the politics of control.” In plain terms, global jihad of the type spawned by al-Qaida had been transformed into a hit-and-run operation after 2002. The recovery of Afghanistan has given Islamic jihad a State and a territorial base. The question is: will the resurrected Taliban regime oblige Reacting to the Taliban takeover and mindful that the role of Pakistan is, once again, likely to come under international scrutiny, its prime minister, Imran Khan, argued that Afghanistan had broken the “shackles of slavery”. Positing the conflict in his neighbouring country as a cultural conflict, he said that Afghans had resisted a bid to make the country “psychologically subservient”. Khan’s bid to project the Taliban as a personification of Afghan nationalism is understandable, and this is also how China would like it to be. What will be tested in the coming months is the extent to which groups in close ideological proximity to the Taliban factions visualize the future direction of Islamic reorientation. More important, will the Taliban 2.0 overcome their earlier urge to be a global nursery for jihadis all over the world? This has a deep bearing on India’s national security since in the coming months there will be a concerted bid by sections of the Pakistani State apparatus to transform conflicts in the Kashmir Valley into an Islamist cause célèbre, on a par with Palestine. On its part, China is certain to use its new-found status as a Taliban-friendly world power to either encourage pressing the accelerator on Kashmir or demanding a price for applying the brakes. For India, the Taliban victory in Afghanistan has brought new foreign policy and security challenges. At present, New Delhi’s old Northern Alliance friends are in disarray but they are certain to regroup and create enclaves of resistance to the Taliban. The choices are clear but difficult: unfriendly indifference or surreptitious encouragement of forces that will not be reconciled to a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. One chapter in Afghanistan’s troubled history has ended. A new one may be just beginning.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-49
19-08-2021||Jharkhand||Gumla villager killed in IED blast||A 45-year-old villager died in an IED explosion in Judwani forest in Jharkhand’s Gumla district on Wednesday night. Police on Thursday dispatched a team to the incident site, over 70km from the district headquarters, to begin probe after learning about the incident. IED triggered explosions have regularly been killing or injuring both civilians and security personnel on anti-naxal operations in this part of the state as at least half a dozen such incidents have been reported so far this year. Gumla SDPO Manish Chandra Lal told reporters that the deceased has been identified as Budheshwar Nagesia, a cattle-grazer and resident of Judwani village under Bishunpur police station. “Yesterday afternoon, he went to the forest to graze his cattle when an IED exploded after he mistakenly stepped on to it. Naxals have planted several IEDs in such forested areas in Gumla and Lohardaga to target security forces but unfortunately even innocent villagers too are falling prey to such nefarious designs,” he said, adding that the team has been dispatched to the area for combing operation. Sources said that the said forest patch on the adjacent Lohardaga district is highly naxal infested. A squad of CPI Maoist zonal commander Ravindra Ganjhu is said to be active in this area. In an identical incident, another 40-year-old villager Ramdeo Munda was killed on July 14 in Kerangani forest under Kurumgarh police station in Gumla district. That incident occurred a day after a similar blast in the area which killed a police canine and injured a cobra battalion jawan under the same police station.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-68

Rao, secretary of Jharkhand Badminton Association (JBA) and joint secretary of Badminton Association of India (BAI) is the second sports administrator from the state to head to Tokyo as the member of the national contingent. Ranchi-based Madhukant Pathak accompanied the India athletics squad as a manager in the recently concluded 2020 Olympics Games in Japan. A seasoned sports administrator, Rao said his appointment was a lifetime achievement and thanked BAI and PCI for the same."I would try my best to guide the para shuttlers. It's an honour for me to be appointed coach-cum-manager for a showpiece event," he added. Rao, chairman of Para Badminton India, said he was optimistic of India claiming three medals, including gold, at the Paralympic Games. Shedding light on his responsibilities as coach-cum manager, the bespectacled Rao said it would include conducting training, preparing practice schedule, see that shuttlers respect time (for training and matches), ensure presence of team physio and supervise food and travel arrangements.

The minister, who was in Dhanbad on Thursday for the second day as part of her Jan Aashirwad Yatra launched four days ago while being prodded by media that earlier it was a double engine government in state and now it is single engine, said, “As education comes in concurrent list so the state government has prime responsibility for educational development of the state but we will try to establish coordination with the state government to ensure all round educational development of the state.” When asked her priorities for Jharkhand in the ministry, she said proper functioning of Central University and IIT would be her priority at present as part of the existing projects and later she will explore more development avenues as she has recently joined the cabinet and is still in process of understanding its nitty gritty. “Our priority at the national level would also be to ensure the proper implementation of new education policy announced by prime minister, Narendra Modi in the last year,” said Devi and added the stress is on vocational education from class VI level in schools. Elaborating about the features of education policy 2020 she said, “Under the new education policy the focus will be on education in local languages and even the engineering education would be imparted in 11 regional Indian languages.” “As per the provisions of new education policy, the education in schools would also be imparted in regional languages and added that provisions are also there for education of visually challenged students through sign languages and all categories of education would be imparted to the students under the same roof,” further said Devi. Earlier, elaborating about the aim of launching the Jan Aashirwad Yatra under which she has already covered seven districts of state, Devi said, “The basic aim of Yatra is to seek the blessing of the common people after being inducted in the union cabinet with the blessing of prime minister Narendra Modi as the structure of cabinet shows it’s inclusive feature representing people from different states, sections of society, age group like youth besides women (11), Other Backward Caste (27), Scheduled Caste (12), Scheduled tribe (8), minority (5)”. “The nation is making progress by leaps and bounds under the strong leadership of Prime Minister, Narendra Modi and inclusive growth of different sections of the society is being ensured in the progress,” said Devi who arrived at Dhanbad on Wednesday during which she was offered a grand welcome by the party activists at several places across the district and also participated in an intellectual meet held at management studies of IIT (ISM). The progressive nature of the state can be assumed from the fact that despite the obstructionist attitude of the Opposition, 20 important bills were passed during the current session showing the commitment of the central Government towards the inclusive progress of the nation. Congress activists of Dhanbad on Thursday, under the leadership of district president, Brajendra Prasad Singh questioned the BJP over rise in fuel prices, unemployment and called upon the party to take out a Chhama Yatra (apology march) against the sufferings caused to common man by the anti people policies of the central government.

The protesters bearing banners, posters and placards who congregated at the chowk at around 12 noon also shouted slogans against the central government criticising it’s alleged anti-poor policy, Modi teri yeh kaisi loot, amiron ko chhut, garibon ko loot; petroleum padarthon ki keemat kam karo, modiji kuchh to sharm karo; rasoi gas ki din pratidih badhti mahangai, kam pad jaati imandari ki kamai. Talking to media, at the sidelines of the protest programme, district president, Brajendra Prasad Singh, “At a time when the common masses are reeling under the impact of pandemic, the steep hike in petrol, diesel and LPG prices carried out by the central government and consequent price rise had made their life further difficult.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-69

19-08-2021||Jharkhand||Covaxin crisis looms in Jharkhand, demand outstrips supply ||Covaxin stocks running dry in Jharkhand after authorities distributed over 90,000 doses of the Bharat Biotech-made vaccine among all 24 districts of the state on Thursday. As per data National Health Mission (NHM), the state vaccine store in Ranchi was out of doses of Covaxin on Wednesday and districts were left with negligible stock to continue the immunisation programme. Bharat Biotech's vaccine is now more sought-after in the state because of a shorter, 28-day gap between two doses as opposed to the 84-day interval mandated for the Serum Institute of India's Covishiled vaccine. Ranchi, which has received the highest share of vaccines in Jharkhand so far, had only 100 Covaxin doses in stock before session sites opened their doors on Wednesday. The count of this vaccine available with the district had almost come down to zero by Thursday morning, sources involved in the immunisation drive said. As per Co-Win portal, Covaxin was available only at Clinic Apollo in Ranchi for Rs 1,410, while none of the government-run session sites made slots available for this vaccine on Thursday. In East Singhbhum and Dhanbad, only paid doses of Covaxin were available. Some beneficiaries of Covaxin, who took the first jab a month ago, had a tough time trying to book a slot for their second dose on Thursday, sources said. Ranchi resident Pranay Ranjan said that the government-run session sites were not providing Covaxin jabs to those who did not have a slot booked through the Co-Win portal. However, no free slots were available for Covaxin on the government portal, he added. “I have also tried booking slots for Covaxin through third party websites, but there were no slots available at government-run session sites. Maybe we will get the slots at government vaccination centres once the state has more vaccines available,” said Ranjan. Thursday's fresh allotments of Covaxin are likely to bring some relief, but its limited availability remains a problem. Ranchi got the highest share of 7,000 doses from the fresh stocks on Thursday, as per health department data. Among other districts, East Singhbhum, Hazaribagh and Palamau received 5,500 doses, while Dhanbad, Dumka and Godda were provided 4,250 doses each. Most of the remaining districts got less than 4,000 doses each. “We are receiving fewer doses of Covaxin from the Centre compared to Covishield, but the demand for the former is much higher due to the smaller gap between the two doses,” said a source from NHM, adding that the health department has asked all districts to prioritise vaccination of those due for their second dose over first-time recipients. As per NHM figures, districts in Jharkhand had 1,02,070 doses of Covaxin before session sites opened on Wednesday, but there was no stock available in the state vaccine store to supply to the districts in case they ran out of this vaccine. On the other hand, the state vaccine store had over 2.74 lakh Covishield doses in stock, while the districts were left with more than 3 lakh Covishiled doses on Thursday.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-69

19-08-2021||Jharkhand||Glitches in West Singhbhum State Food Security Scheme: Survey||A survey by Khadya Suraksha Jan Adhikar  Manch (a coalition of organisations espousing cause of food and social security) in Maoist affected mineral rich hub of West Singhbhum district of Jharkhand paints a dismal picture on food security schemes for poor. The survey done by the members for the four months between April and July 2021 among 709 green ration card holder families in 54 villages of seven blocks (Chakradharpur, Hatgamharia, Sonua, Khuntpani, Tonto, Tantnagar and Goilkera) in West Singhbhum districts found widespread irregularities in the distribution of rations under the State Food Security Scheme. The survey points out that only 22 per cent of the 709 surveyed green ration card holders have received ration for the four months during April-July 2021 and only 21 per cent of the households have got ration only for one month and only 6.5 per cent of the card holders have not got it even once. “Out of 709 card holders, only 10 families have got ration cards. Many are not even aware of their card number. The final priority list of green ration card of the district has not been made public as per rules till date,” said Siraj Dutta, one of the members of the manch. Significantly, under the state food security scheme which was launched by chief minister Hemant Soren in November 2020 those families living below the poverty line in the state but deprived of ration cards as part on National Food Security Act (based on 2011 census) were supposed to be given a green ration card by the state government and entitled to receive one rupee per kg of food grains. Five kg of grains per unit (person) would be given to the green card holders. “The survey shows that till now neither all eligible applicants are connected nor green ration card holders are getting ration regularly,” added Siraj Dutta. The outfit members also submitted a report of their survey along with a set of demands to West Singhbhum deputy commissioner Ananya Mittal on Wednesday. “It seems that there are similar scenes in other blocks of the district (there are 18 blocks in the district). We have demanded that final priority list of the green ration cards should be published and uploaded in the district website and also made public in block and panchayat offices, ensure regular ration to green card beneficiaries, conduct an audit of the food grains arrived for the months of April-July, stock and distribution of the same period,” informed Siraj Dutta. Mittal confirmed receiving the survey report. “As per our records the National Food Security schemes along with the state food security schemes are running smoothly. However, we will check the findings of the survey in the concerned block and panchayat through the marketing officer in-charges and PDS dealers to find out the reason for such irregularities,’ said West Singhbhum deputy commissioner Mittal.
