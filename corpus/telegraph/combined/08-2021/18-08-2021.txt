The incident happened on Elliot Road, barely a kilometre from Park Street, around 12.3am on Tuesday. Eyewitnesses said people ran helter-skelter when the suspect, identified as Sohail Khan, fired at least thrice. Lawrence D’Cruz was hit in the leg. His brother Francis said doctors had told them the bullet exited the right leg leaving a wound, which would be operated upon on Wednesday. Lawrence used to run a catering business, which shut down in 2020 because of the pandemic, Francis said. The brothers now run a roadside eatery. “I had just finished my dinner on Monday night when I heard hue and cry outside. I went to the balcony when someone shouted ‘tere bhai ko goli laga hai (your brother has been shot at)’. I immediately rushed out. By then our neighbours had shifted him to hospital,” Francis said. The police said before they arrived, the prime accused — Khan and his associates Shahnawaz Sagar alias Nawab and Mohammad Shahrekh, all residents of Elliot Lane — fled leaving their two-wheeler behind. Cops seized an empty cartridge, a live cartridge and a slipper were seized. Sheikh Irfan, an Elliot Lane resident who was at the spot, said: “Sohail (Khan) had played for the team that lost. After the match, he started assaulting the goalkeeper of the winning team. But he left when others intervened. After some time, he and his friends came back and started drinking outside the club. When my brother-in-law (Tazim Hossain) protested, he opened fire.” Khan fired at least three bullets, one of which hit Lawrence. “The first bullet was targeted at my brother-in-law (Hossain) but it hit a wall. Sohail and his friends then tried to flee while people around them panicked. He fired again pointing towards the ground. This time the bullet hit Lawrence on his leg. The third bullet was fired in the air,” Irfan said. Later in the day, officers of Park Street police station arrested the three accused. The three used to drive private vehicles.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-14

The last time the couple connected over a chat messenger was around 5.30pm (IST) on Monday. The husband instructed her to hide her marriage documents to keep her safe from the possible adversities she might encounter if word spread that she had married someone outside her religion and caste, Subrata Dutta told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening. However, before they could decide on how and where she could seek help, she had gone offline. Her name, location and native language are being withheld for security reasons. Dutta, a resident of Nagerbazar in north Calcutta, said he had left more than 100 messages in her inbox sharing contacts of his friends in Afghanistan and numbers that could help her reach the Indian embassy there. “I am yet to get any response. The last time we spoke, she was insisting that she was fine. I could understand she was just trying to pacify me,” said Dutta. Dutta said he had met his wife during one of his professional assignments to Afghanistan. “As I used to be surrounded by armed troops as part of my job profile, I could not talk to her in person. We usually kept in touch through chats and emails. In 2015, we decided to get married. That was when she came down to Calcutta and we got married here,” Dutta said. On June 1, Dutta’s wife left for Afghanistan to meet her family after more than five years. “Her parents are no more. But her siblings are there. She was at her sister’s place when I spoke,” Dutta said. He has been restless since reports of Taliban capturing one Afghan district after another started pouring in. He had advised her to come back but she felt her city would be safe. “She came online on Monday evening and we spoke. All through she was trying to tell me that she was fine. I could make out that she was confused and scared. She was just trying to calm me down. My first idea was to reach out to the Indian embassy there. But I could sense, as her family was there, she did not sound comfortable with the idea,” Dutta said. He said he offered to bring her entire family to Calcutta if she wanted. “We were discussing the pros and cons, the ways we could reach out to people who can help her come out of the place. I was telling her to immediately hide all evidence of our marriage…. The last message she posted was ‘Look look we are safe’ before she suddenly went offline,” Dutta said. The woman, who was an artist in Afghanistan, has been a homemaker in Calcutta as she did not have the work permit here. Dutta has contacted multiple government agencies. “I am very hopeful she will be online soon…. My wife loves the sea. She saw the sea for the first time in her life here at Mandarmani. I would love to take her to the sea again once she is back. I am sure that will happen soon,” he said. Huddled in building A 42-year-old father of two from Kurseong, who left for Afghanistan less than a month ago to work in a security agency, is among the thousands of Indians stranded in the country. He had last contacted his family through a WhatsApp call at 9pm on Monday using the Wi-Fi connection of a fellow Indian, his wife Sanju said on Tuesday evening. “Yesterday, he made a brief call to inform me that he was in a building with many others close to the airport. The airport was closed,” Sanju said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-14

The test will be held to fill 53 seats each in the civil, electrical and mechanical engineering courses. “The exam is being held in three cities so that the physical distancing norm, a key component of the Covid protocol, could be followed,” a JU official said. Last year, the test could not be held because of the pandemic and students were admitted based on their performance in diploma courses in engineering. “This year the university will hold the exam in three cities following the Covid protocol,” said JU pro-vice-chancellor Chiranjeeb Bhattacharya. An official of the university said the cities were chosen so that the candidates did not have to travel much. “If we asked all the candidates to converge at a lone centre, this could lead to a large assembly — a scenario that is not advisable amid the pandemic. Since there is a curb on transport also, spreading the centres will help the candidates in travelling to the venues,” he said. Earlier, the state joint entrance examination board used to conduct the test on behalf of JU. This year the university is conducting the test itself. Exam details are available on the JU website. In early July after the higher education had barred the board from holding any entrance test on behalf of Presidency University citing pandemic, the board came up with a notification on July 8 stating that it would not conduct any institution specific entrance test “until there is any revised decision by the competent authority”. Last year after JU had conducted counselling, of the 50 seats each in electrical and mechanical engineering courses, 33 and 34 seats remained vacant, prompting the university to hold a fresh round of counselling. “We hope the situation will improve while screening candidates through an entrance test,” said a JU official.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-15

First doses will be administered on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays,” said a deputy chief municipal health officer of the CMC.

18-08-2021||Calcutta||Historian slams attempt to recount horrors of Partition to add fuel to fire of divisive politics||Historian Sugata Bose on Tuesday called out the attempts to recount the horrors of Partition to add fuel to the fire of the divisive politics that he said was ruining the country. “The (Bengal) Famine and the Partition define what we were as a people…. We don’t just have to remember. We have to know how to remember. There are attempts and there will be attempts to remember and to evoke the horror of the Partition in quite the wrong way, in the age of the worst kind of divisive politics which is ruining contemporary India,” Bose, Harvard professor and the grandnephew of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, told a Calcutta audience. He was one of the speakers at the inauguration of an exhibition on Partition at a gallery in the city. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on August 14 that the day would now be observed as “Partition Horrors Remembrance Day”, stressing that the misery suffered during the 1947 Partition of the country can never be forgotten. The tweet drew criticism from many quarters. The statement was seen as an attempt at reopening old wounds and polarising people, especially in the run-up to the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. A social media campaign, which tries to reinvigorate attempts to pin the blame of the atrocities committed during Partition on one community, is under way. Several posts from Right-wing sympathisers have likened the horrors of the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan to that of the Indian Partition. In reality, both Hindus and Muslims, hundreds of thousands of them, were subjected to excruciating torture and forced to leave their homes because of Partition. Speaking to this newspaper on the sidelines of Tuesday’s programme, Bose talked about the Prime Minister’s tweet. “On August 14, a tweet from the Prime Minister talking about the horrors of Partition was designed to foment continuing hatred and provide more fuel to the divisive politics that has been ruining contemporary India. There are other ways to remember it,” he said. During his address, he had talked about another way to remember Partition. “If artistes can sensitively portray the loss of Partition, the tragedy of Partition as they have in this exhibition, then it can have some cathartic value, a catharsis that will enable us to transcend the bitterness of Partition, to leave the hatred that had led to Partition behind and help us build a much more fruitful subcontinent,” he said. The exhibition, underway from August 17 to 29, is titled The Legacy of Loss: Perspectives on the Partition of Bengal. Organised by the Kolkata Centre for Creativity and Kolkata Partition Museum, it is a collection of paintings, photographs and installations of five contemporary artists. “While some of these artists have inherited a sense of loss from their parents or grandparents, others have grown to identify with it, and inhabit it from a place of empathy and intellectual curiosity,” said the curatorial note. Gianluca Rubagotti, the Italian consul general in Calcutta, filmmaker Goutam Ghose and artist Shuvaprasanna were among the other speakers to mark the inauguration. An excerpt from Home in the World, Amartya Sen’s memoir that came out in July this year, greeted visitors to the exhibition and also summed up its mood. “All this changed with the Partition of the country in 1947. The communal riots and terrible bloodshed generated continuous sadness. It also meant we had to move. Dhaka became the capital of a newly born East Pakistan, and my family’s home base had to shift to Santiniketan. I loved Santiniketan, but I greatly missed Dhaka…. I had lost a world. The loss of Dhaka could not be obliterated by the fulfilment — great as it was — of being in Santiniketan. Enjoying a new life, I was rapidly discovering, does not exclude intensely missing the old,” it read.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-15

However, the ban on launching new technology initiatives remains, the sources said. In December last year, the RBI had come out with an unprecedented action implementing both the bans, after repeated instances of technological outages at the lender, which is the market leader in the credit cards segment. Rivals ICICI Bank and SBI Cards seized the opportunity to narrow the gap with HDFC Bank. “A communication has been received by HDFC Bank regarding the lifting of the ban on credit cards on Tuesday,” one of the sources said.

Cairn had in May asked a US federal court to force Air India to pay a $1.26 billion arbitration award the firm had won in December. The government on August 13 filed a ‘Motion to Dismiss’ petition in the US District Court for the District of Colombia, saying it lacked subject matter jurisdiction in the dispute between Cairn and the Indian tax authority, according to a filing seen by PTI. This comes a week after the government enacted legislation to scrap a rule that gave the tax department power to go 50 years back and slap capital gains levies wherever ownership had changed hands overseas, but business assets were in India. That rule had been used to levy a cumulative Rs 1.10 lakh crore of tax on 17 entities, including Rs 10,247 crore on Cairn. Officials said rules for withdrawal of such tax demands are in the process of being framed. “One of the requirements for the dropping of the retrospective tax demands is that the parties concerned have to give an undertaking for withdrawal of all cases against the government/tax department. So, while all this is in process, the government is obligated to respond in any legal matter where there is a time bar for doing so,” an official explained. Cairn had challenged the tax demand before an international arbitration tribunal, which in December last year overturned the same and ordered the government to refund the money collected. The government initially refused to return $1.2 billion, forcing Cairn to take action to recover that money through a seizure of Indian assets overseas.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-103

18-08-2021||Business||Future Retail asked to get SC stay or scrap deal with Reliance||The Delhi high court on Tuesday said it will implement the single-judge order restraining Future Retail Ltd (FRL) from going ahead with the Rs 24,713-crore deal with Reliance Retail to sell its business in case no stay is obtained from the Supreme Court within four weeks. Justice Suresh Kumar Kait, hearing Amazon’s plea for enforcement of the award by Singapore’s Emergency Arbitrator (EA) restraining FRL from going ahead with the deal, said in the absence of any stay from the apex court, he has no option but to enforce the order passed by Justice J.R. Midha on March 18. “Either get a stay within 2-3 weeks on the March 18 order or comply with the order. This court has no third option,” the judge said. Listing the matter for further hearing on September 17, the court said: “I make it clear that if before the next date of hearing the respondents fail to get any stay order, this court shall proceed with the matter for implementation of the order dated 18.03.2021.” Senior advocate Parag Tripathi, representing Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL) and other related parties, said that a special leave petition against the March 18 order has already been filed before the Supreme Court by his clients. Senior advocate Darius Khambata, representing FRL, said his client has moved an application before the arbitration tribunal and will also file an appeal before the apex court. Considering that the March 18 order on the legality of the emergency award was upheld by the Supreme Court on August 6, his clients still had time till August 20 to comply with the directions in terms of the order, he added. “Simply filing SLP will not help you. You get the order of stay. I have only one option i.e to get the order implemented,” the court observed. Senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, appearing for Amazon, argued that in view of the Supreme Court’s decision, Justice Midha’s order was effective and has to be complied with. Kishore Biyani and 15 others, including FRL and FCPL, have been embroiled in a series of litigations with Amazon, an investor in FCPL, over the deal with Reliance. On March 18, besides restraining FRL from going ahead with its deal with Reliance Retail, Justice Midha had imposed costs of Rs 20 lakh on Future Group and others associated with it and ordered attachment of their properties. The court had asked the parties to file an affidavit detailing their assets within one month and show cause as to why they be not detained under civil prison for three months for violating the emergency arbitrator’s order. It had also asked Future Group to place on record the details of action taken by it in connection with the Reliance deal after the emergency arbitrator’s order. Amazon and Future have been locked in a bitter legal tussle after the former dragged Future Group to arbitration at Singapore International Arbitration Centre in October last year, arguing that FRL had violated their contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance. On August 6, the Supreme Court upheld the legality of the EA award.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-103
18-08-2021||Business||Centre announces rates of tax refunds under export promotion scheme||The Centre on Tuesday announced the rates of tax refunds under the export promotion scheme RoDTEP for 8,555 products, such as marine goods, yarn and dairy items. The government has set aside Rs 12,454 crore for refunds under the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme for the current fiscal. Under RoDTEP, various central and state duties, taxes, and levies imposed on input products, among others, would be refunded to exporters. The benefits will be available from January this year, for which the Centre will make proportional allotments. RoDTEP support will be available to eligible exporters at a notified rate as a percentage of Freight On Board (FOB) value. The tax refund rates range from 0.5 per cent to 4.3 per cent for various sectors. The scheme replaces popular MEIS (Merchandise Exports of India Scheme) where the incentive rates ranged from 2 per cent to 5 per cent but which had to be shelved following complaints from the US that the scheme violated the rules of the World Trade Organisation. Sectors such as steel, pharmaceuticals and chemicals have been kept out of the scheme. Commerce secretary B.V.R Subrahmanyam said the Centre has allotted Rs 19,400 crore in this fiscal for RoDTEP and the Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL), which is for textile exporters. The two schemes cover 95 per cent of the tariff lines for goods and exports. The allotment for RoSCTL is Rs 6,946 crore, and the rest is for RoDTEP. “Today we have notified the rates. RoDTEP is going to be a long-lasting scheme and it is going to be a flagship scheme of the commerce ministry. It is also WTO compliant,” Subrahmanyam said. Arpita Mukherjee of ICRIER said: “The US is closely monitoring this scheme and India needs to be ready with responses to counter any concerns raised by the trading partners. While MEIS was a prohibited subsidy, it was fairly easy to claim. The RodTEP should also be easy to claim and necessary processes should be in place to ensure that.” She said subsidies could have been given to services used in manufacturing which cannot be challenged at the WTO. Pralok Gupta, WTO Studies, IIFT, said: “The scheme is WTO compliant and helps boost India’s export competitiveness. The rates could be reviewed, depending on the market conditions and sector’s performance.” “Since the rates are fixed on the basis of the data furnished by the industry, which was also affected due to the pandemic, the rates may be reviewed if more comprehensive and updated data is furnished by the industry,” Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) president A. Sakthivel said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-103

Intimation regarding closure of further investigation into the high-profile case was filed by the CBI before special judge A S Sayyad.  Bora, who was working in Mumbai, was allegedly killed by her mother Indrani Mukerjea, a former media executive, and two others. Mukerjea is a key accused in the case.  Other accused in the case include former media baron Peter Mukerjea and Indrani Mukerjea's ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna.  Bora was Indrani Mukerjea's daughter from an earlier relationship. The 24-year-old was allegedly strangled to death in a car by Indrani Mukerjea, her then driver Shyamvar Rai and Khanna in April 2012 over a financial dispute, according to the prosecution.  Her body was burnt in a forest in neighbouring Raigad district. The matter came to light in 2015 following the arrest of Rai in another case and led to the arrest Indrani Mukerjea and Khanna.  Peter Mukerjea was also later arrested for allegedly being a part of the murder conspiracy. He is currently out on bail, which was granted by the Bombay High Court.  Indrani Mukerjea and Peter Mukerjea had got married in 2002, but later became estranged. A family court in Mumbai granted them divorce in October 2019.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-301

The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) also cautioned domestic exporters and sought the Centre's intervention in preventing losses to the business community. Afghan exports to India include dried raisin, walnut, almond, fig, pine nut, pistachios, dried apricot and fresh fruits such as apricot, cherry, watermelon, and medicinal herbs, according to a CAIT statement. India's exports to Afghanistan include tea, coffee, pepper and cotton, toys, footwear and various other consumable items. "With recent change of regime in Afghanistan, the bilateral trade between Kabul and India will be impacted badly since the future is uncertain," CAIT's Delhi NCR unit convenor Sushil Kumar Jain said. "The bilateral trade between India and Afghanistan was $1.4 billion in 2020-21 as against $1.52 billion in 2019-20. Exports from India were $ 826 million and imports were aggregated at $510 million in 2020-21," Jain said, citing figures released by the CAIT. The association expressed fear that prices of the products imported from Afghanistan may go up in markets due to uncertainty of the political situation in that country. It also feared that currently several import-export shipments are stranded due to the situation in Afghanistan which may cause heavy losses to traders, advising domestic exporters to remain alert and keep an eye on the developments. "Huge amounts of payments are likely to get blocked or delayed which will put traders in a vulnerable situation. The government must take cognisance of it and help the traders in the event of a financial crisis," the CAIT said. The Taliban, a militant group, has taken over power in Afghanistan from an elected government as its insurgents stormed the country and captured all major cities and provinces in recent days even before the US could completely pull out its troops from the two-decade-old war theatre.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-301
18-08-2021||India||Railways reevaluating bidding process for Rs 30, 000 crore private passenger trains||The railways is reevaluating the ongoing bidding process for the Rs 30,000 crore private passenger trains after it failed to receive any interest from private players for its tender floated last year for the operation of such trains in 12 clusters, senior officials confirmed on Wednesday. Of the 12 clusters put up for bidding, only three saw any bid at all, they said. "The entire process of inviting tenders for the private passenger train operations is being re-evaluated. The present process bids may or may not be scrapped after the review is complete," an official said. It was in July last year that the Ministry of Railways rolled out bids for private participation in passenger train operations in twelve clusters across the country. The plan included 109 origin-destination pairs. Winning bidders were to be provided a concession period of 35 years on a revenue basis model. During the Request for Qualification (RFQ) last year, 16 private sector firms showed interest in the project. GMR Highways Ltd, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd (IRCTC), IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd, Cube Highways and Infrastructure III Pte. Ltd, and CAF India Private Ltd were some of the major firms that evinced interest in the project. This number significantly reduced in the recently held RFP stage (financial bidding) with only two bidders coming forward. The bids were submitted by IRCTC and Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Ltd for three clusters, while all other bidders backed out, citing concession rules favouring the Indian Railways, sources said. The officials indicated that the absence of a regulator, payment of haulage charges in addition to sharing revenue, and curbs on route flexibility are among the likely reasons that kept bidders away from the railways' ambitious plans. The Indian Railways in July last year planned to introduce private trains on its network in phases, with the first dozen due to start running in the 2023-24 financial year and all 151 by 2027. According to the Railway Ministry's projections, the transporter was supposed to select the companies that will run the private trains by April 2021; the first 12 were expected to start plying by 2023-24, followed by 45 more in FY 2024-25, the next 50 in FY 2025-26 and the last 44 by 2026-27. Now, the sources said that the ministry has gone back to the drawing board to plan the modalities of the entire scheme from scratch.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-301

It said in a statement that the Supreme Court Collegium, in its meeting held on August 17, has recommended names of four chief justices of different high courts for elevation as top court judges. Besides them, names of Justice B V Nagarathna from the Karnataka High Court, Justice C T Ravikumar of Kerala High Court, Justice M M Sundresh of Madras High Court and Justice Bela Trivedi from the Gujarat High Court judge have been recommended by the Collegium.

The minister, in a meeting with COP 26 president-designate Alok Sharma, said the government is taking concrete steps and at appreciable speed to meet its commitments on the target of 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030. She also said 100 GW of this renewable energy had already been achieved. Among other important initiatives, she mentioned the extensive work done on Hydrogen Energy Mission. The minister discussed various issues related to climate change and specifically COP 26 -- the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, a Finance Ministry statement said. The UK will host the international climate conference COP 26 in November this year. With regards to ongoing discussions on climate change in various fora, Sitharaman referring to the dialogue on climate justice spoke about the need to bring a sense of compassion towards the poor. The Finance Minister expressed hope that the commitment made by the developed countries to provide USD 100 billion per year to developing countries would be achieved and was optimistic about a positive outcome on the new collective goals on finance in COP 26. The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 countries at COP 21 in Paris, on December 12, 2015 and entered into force on November 4, 2016. Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degree Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-302

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the Taliban is a terrorist organisation which is linked to the Haqqani network in Pakistan, which indulge in anti-India terrorist acts with the help and support of the Pakistan government. He said the Taliban are patron of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar and the Lashkar-e-Taiba and one wonders how the government will protect the interests of India as such terror organisations get emboldened when their patron assume power in Afghanistan. "When such violent terrorist organisations control Afghanistan, then terrorist organisations based in Pakistan directly get protection and what is the Indian government doing about it. Prime Minister Modi and Amit Shah ji should come forward and tell us," he asked. Surjewala said India has always been in favour of a duly elected government in Afghanistan as women and children will get equal rights when democracy is there. "When the Taliban captured Afghanistan last time, everyone saw what heart-rendering treatment was given to women and minorities and all those speaking in favour of democracy. One shudders to even think of these events. Women all over the world are today worried about the Afghan women that their rights will be violated. We are also concerned about this," he said. Recalling the IC-814 plane hijacking, he said the ministers in the then BJP government released Masood Azhar in Kandahar. "Did India not sign an agreement with the Taliban at the time. How an Indian delegation was sent to Doha for talks with the Taliban," he said. Noting that the situation in Afghanistan is very serious, the Congress spokesperson said he had warned the Indian government that Afghanistan has become the regime of violent terrorist organisations and "we have to protect our interests".||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-302

If state governments want they can lower the prices of petrol and diesel, as a state did so recently, he said in a press conference at the Delhi BJP office. "We are sensitive towards it and are taking possible steps like doing blending of 10 per cent which we are going to raise to 20 per cent. So, we are taking many steps," Puri said when asked about the rising prices of petroleum products including cooking gas. The Congress government in 2010 deregulated prices of petrol and diesel, meaning there would be a local impact of international rates, he said. "The Centre imposes excise tax on petrol and diesel, while states impose VAT on it. We use this excise money to fund schemes like PM Garib Kalyan Yojna under which 80 crore people received free foodgrains, PM Awas Yojna, Ujjwala scheme," he said. Puri said that the Congress government, before 2014, issued oil bonds of Rs 1.34 lakh crore to control prices of petrol and "passed on their problem to us. They emptied the chest. We have to pay Rs 20,000 crore this year for the oil bonds that have a maturity period of 15 years." The minister also hit at the Congress saying the figures on oil bonds presented by it were "flawed" and challenged the party to ask states ruled by it to reduce VAT on petrol and diesel.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-302

18-08-2021||India||Covid ebbing as R-value drops to below 1 in country||After breaching the value of 1 in the first week of August, the R number, which reflects how rapidly the coronavirus pandemic is spreading, has been steadily ebbing, according to researchers at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai. India's R has fallen to around 0.9, Sitbara Sinha, who is leading the research, told PTI, citing their data. If R is lesser than 1, it means the number of newly infected people is lower than the number of infected people in the preceding period and the disease incidence is going down. The R-value of Kerala, which has the highest number of active cases in the country, is now below 1 after a gap of seven months, signalling a relief to authorities who have been struggling to bring down the injection levels in the state. The northeastern states seem to have finally come out of the second wave, Sinha said. The R-value between August 14-16, calculated by the researchers now stands at 0.89. The R-value for Maharashtra, another state which has a high number of cases, is 0.89, the data shows. However, Himachal Pradesh continues to have an R-value of above 1, although it reduced in the last few days, while Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand still have R very close to 1, Sinha said. Among the major cities, the R-value of Mumbai was lowest (0.70 from August 10-13), followed by Delhi (0.85 from July 31 to August 4), Bengaluru (0.94 from August 15-17), Chennai (0.97 from August 15-17). However, the R-value remains high for Calcutta (1.08 from August 11-15), Pune (1.05 from August 10-14), The Reproduction number or R refers to how many people an infected person infects, on average. In other words, it tells how 'efficiently' a virus is spreading. A smaller R indicates the disease is on a decline. Conversely, if R is greater than 1, the number of infected people is increasing in each round - technically, this is what is called the epidemic phase. After the devastating second wave that saw hospitals and health infrastructure being overwhelmed by the patients infected by SARS-CoV2 coronavirus, the R-value started to decline. During the March-May period, thousands of people died due to the infection while lakhs were infected. In its bulletin on Wednesday, the Ministry of Health said India saw a single-day rise of 25,166 new COVID-19 cases, the lowest in 154 days, taking the tally to 3,22,50,679. The national recovery rate was recorded at 97.51 per cent, the highest since March 2020. Less than 50,000 daily cases have been reported for 52 consecutive days. From June 20 to July 7, the R-value stood at 0.78. However, it slowly started increasing - it was 0.88 from July 3-22, 0.95 from July 24-27, 0.96 from July 27-31. It breached the value of 1.03 for the first time after the second wave during August 6-9. However, since then it has slowly started to decline. The value was 0.92 from August 6-9, rose to 0.99 between August 12-14. But it slipped to 0.89 between August 14-17. Earlier this month, the central government said 37 districts across nine states, including Kerala (11 districts) and Tamil Nadu (seven districts) are still showing a rising trend in the average daily new COVID-19 cases over the previous two weeks even as the nationwide daily new infections continued to register a decline. It said the R-value is more than 1 in five states -- Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh which remains a cause of concern.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-302
18-08-2021||India||SC allows women to appear for NDA examination||In a major step towards gender equality, the Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed eligible women to take the examination for admission to National Defence Academy (NDA) scheduled to be held on September 5. The top court, however, said that the result of the examination would be subject to final adjudication of the petition. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy passed the interim order on a plea filed by one Kush Kalra, which has sought a direction to the authorities concerned to allow eligible female candidates to appear in the National Defence Academy and Naval Academy Examination' and train at the NDA. The bench also directed the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to take out an appropriate notification in view of its order and give due publicity to it. During the hearing, senior advocate Chinmoy Pradip Sharma, appearing for Kalra, said they have received the Centre's counter affidavit on Tuesday in which the government has stated that it is purely a policy decision and court should not interfere with it. The bench told Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati that why is the government continuing in this direction after the verdicts of this court related to extending permanent commission in the Army and Navy to women. This is unfounded now. We are finding it absurd. Will the Army act on after the judicial orders are passed? We will then pass an order, if that is what you want. I have this impression right from the High Court that till an order is passed, the Army does not believe in doing anything voluntarily, the bench said. Bhati said the Army has conferred Permanent Commission (PC) to many women. The bench said, You had kept on opposing it (PC) till the orders were passed by this court. You did not do anything of your own. The Navy and Air Force were more forthcoming while the Army seems to have some kind of bias. Bhati said that in this case there are several modes of entry into the Army like NDA, Indian Military Academy (IMA) and Officers Training Academy (OTA) and women can enter into the force through OTA and IMA. The bench said, Why is it not through NDA. Is co-education a problem? Bhati said that this is a policy decision that women are not allowed in NDA. The top court told Bhati that this policy decision is based on gender discrimination. It said, We direct the respondents (Centre) to take a constructive view of the matter in view of the judgements of this court . Bhati said that she herself had argued the PC matter and appeared for women Short Service Commission officers, who were seeking grant of the PC. The bench said its endeavour is to persuade the Army to do things by itself rather than on the basis of judicial orders. We tried but there was no success in the Permanent Commission matter either in the High Court or even in the Supreme Court till Justice Chandrachud passed the order, the bench said. The top court told Bhati that even if it is a matter of policy the government was still allowing women's entry through two other ways, then why would it say no to the third way. It is not a case of just gender principle but it is a case of discrimination , the bench said, adding that women officers are now admitted even in combat roles. Bhati said that in the Army women are granted permanent commission only in 10 streams while in the Air Force they are admitted as fighter pilots. The bench observed that the mindset is to change which is not changing at all and even during hearing of permanent commission before the High Court, the government counsel had tried to persuade the Army but it did not materialise. The Air Force and Navy have acted in a more liberal way. However, in the Army, you kept giving them a five-five years job and never gave permanent commission till the verdict of the Supreme Court. If you are introducing women in the Army then why do you create a bar in NDA, the bench said, adding that the government should not compel judicial intervention all the time. It said, We, as an institution, must confess that we may not know all the intricacies of the structure of the Army but the broader principle of gender neutrality that you must understand and adapt to in the backdrop of your peculiarities. Court passing blanket orders does not advance the actual cause . On March 10, the top court had sought responses from the Centre and others on a plea which has raised the issue of exclusion of eligible and willing female candidates from joining the prestigious National Defence Academy (NDA) solely on the ground of sex that it is a violation of fundamental right to equality. The top court had issued notices to the Centre, the UPSC and others seeking their responses on the plea which said the categorical exclusion of eligible female candidates from entering the National Defence Academy is not constitutionally justifiable and is simply done on the basis of their sex." The plea filed by advocate Kush Kalra has referred to the February last year landmark verdict in which the apex court had directed that women officers in the Army be granted PC and command postings.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-302
18-08-2021||India||Anil Deshmukh skips ED appearance again||Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh has again skipped appearing before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money laundering case stating that he was taking recourse to "lawful remedies" for the protection of his liberty. This was the fifth time that the 71-year-old NCP minister refused to appear before the ED. Deshmukh sent a three-page reply to the investigating officer of the case through his lawyer saying that the Supreme Court has "made it open for me to take recourse to all appropriate remedies available under CrPC (criminal procedure code) including filing of a quashing petition". He added that he was taking recourse to legal remedies for the protection of his liberty "within a day or two". Deshmukh added he was a "law-abiding citizen" as he requested the agency to record his statement through an electronic medium, till the time "appropriate orders are passed by court(s)". The next step being mulled by the agency was not informed. The ED had issued the fifth summons to Deshmukh and his son Hrishikesh after the Supreme Court on August 16 refused interim protection to the politician from any coercive action by the federal agency. A three-judge bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar, however, had said that Deshmukh was at liberty to access remedies. Deshmukh has last month issued a video statement stating that he would appear before the ED "after" the apex court's decision on his petition. "I had received ED's summons after which I filed a petition in the Supreme Court. I will go to the ED to record my statement after the SC's decision on my petition," Deshmukh had said. The summonses were issued to the former home minister in connection with the criminal case registered under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) related to an alleged Rs 100 crore bribery-cum-extortion racket in the Maharashtra Police establishment that led to Deshmukh's resignation in April. The agency had raided Deshmukh's premises in Mumbai and Nagpur in June apart from that of his aides and some others. It subsequently arrested two of his aides, personal secretary Sanjeev Palande (51) and personal assistant Kundan Shinde (45). The ED case against Deshmukh and others was made out after the CBI booked him in a corruption case related to allegations of at least Rs 100 crore bribery made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh. The ED recently also attached assets worth Rs 4.20 crore of Deshmukh and his family. The ED had claimed its probe found that "Deshmukh, while acting as home minister of Maharashtra, with dishonest intention has received illegal gratification of approximately Rs 4.70 crore in cash from various orchestra bar owners, through Sachin Waze, then the assistant police inspector of Mumbai Police." The NCP leader has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in these instances and his lawyers have called the ED action against him unjustified. Deshmukh had said Singh made the allegations against him after he was removed from the post of Mumbai Police Commissioner.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-302
18-08-2021||India||Madras High Court asks Centre to free 'caged parrot' CBI||The Madras High Court has batted for more functional autonomy for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), without any government control and bring the premier agency on par with departments that report directly to the Prime Minister. Charging the agency with dragging its feet whenever the court wanted to hand over serious cases, saying it lacked the resources and manpower to take up the probe, the Madurai bench on Tuesday said this has "been parroted" for a long time before the court whenever it wanted to hand over the investigation of certain cases to the CBI. "This order is an attempt to release the "Caged Parrot (CBI)," the bench was quoted as saying by ndtv.com. The agency should be made independent with functional autonomy without the administrative control of the government. "The CBI shall be made more independent like Election Commission of India and Comptroller and Auditor General of India," it said. "Its director should be given the power of the Secretary to the government and should report to the Prime Minister or the Minister concerned," Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice B Pugalendhi said. There was a need to have a special act to provide statutory status to the CBI, they added. The CBI currently reports to the DoPT (the Department of Personnel and Training) under the Prime Minister's Office, and the agency's chief is chosen by a three-member panel comprising the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of India and the Leader of the Opposition. The court was hearing a plea from petitioners in Ramanathapuram district in Tamil Nadu, seeking to transfer the probe into a case of cheating depositors of Rs 300 crore to a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the CBI. "This ground (lack of resources and man power) has been parroted time and again before the court", the judges said. The court said the CBI lacked sufficient financial administrative powers and that it should be vested with ex-officio powers of the Secretary to the government. The judges suggested that the premier agency has to be elevated to such heights that it cane be equated with the US' FBI and the Scotland yard. "There is no doubt that the conviction rate of the cases probed by CBI was 60 per cent, but it needed to be enhanced," the court said. The courts handed over cases to CBI because they had faith in them. Some times cases were handed over even without the State's consent, the bench said. The judges wanted the agency to file a well thought out policy within six weeks for permanent recruiting of Cyber forensic and financial audit experts. The Government should clear pending proposals pertaining to CBI infrastructure development. The court also directed the central forensic science laboratory to clear cases pending as on December 2020.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-302
18-08-2021||India||SC may resume physical hearings soon, says CJI||The Supreme Court on Wednesday indicated that physical hearing in the apex court, which is conducting proceedings virtually amid the Covid-19 pandemic since March last year, may resume soon. A bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana said that physical hearing in the apex court may start within 10 days. The bench, also comprising Justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose, said this while hearing pleas against the Bombay High Court verdict in a matter related to tariff order passed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India last year. The bench said in virtual hearing, sometimes they are unable to see or hear lawyers arguing the matter. "We may hear physically after one week or 10 days," the CJI observed. The top court has been hearing cases through video-conferencing since March last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and several bar bodies and lawyers have been demanding that physical hearings should resume immediately. In July this year, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) had written a letter to the CJI urging that physical hearing in the apex court be resumed saying the Covid-19 situation in the national capital has become almost normal". Earlier in March this year the apex court had commenced hybrid proceedings, a combination of virtual and physical hearing, amid demands by lawyers for resumption of complete physical hearings.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-302
18-08-2021||India||India committed to UN Climate Convention & Paris Agreement, says minister||India is committed to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Paris Agreement, Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said on Wednesday while extending support to the UK which will host the international climate conference COP 26 in November this year. The minister, in a meeting with COP 26 President-Designate Alok Sharma, said that India will work constructively for successful and balanced outcome at the UNFCCC COP26 (conference of parties). The minister discussed issues relating to climate change, COP 26, India-UK 2030 Roadmap and other related matters, ministry sources said. "Had an engaging and fruitful discussion with @COP26 President @AlokSharma_RDG and assured India's full support to the UK for a successful COP 26. "Conveyed the Indian government's position that COP 26 should ensure a balanced outcome with equal treatment to agenda items such as adaptation, finance, technology transfer," Yadav tweeted after the meeting. India believes climate actions must be nationally determined and advocates that the differentiation and operationalisation of flexibility in the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement for developing nations must be at the core of decision-making, he said. The environment minister also noted the global initiatives spearheaded by India under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for tackling climate change, like Leadership Group for Industry Transition (LeadIT), Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) and International Solar Alliance (ISA). Alok Sharma sought the support of India on COP 26 initiatives launched by the UK and for a successful COP at Glasgow, and acknowledged India's leadership role, the ministry said. Both the leaders also exchanged views on important climate negotiation agenda items to be deliberated in the upcoming COP 26 at Glasgow, it said in an official statement.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-303
18-08-2021||India||Congress slams govt over hike in prices of LPG cylinders||The Congress on Wednesday hit out at the government over the hike in prices of LPG cylinders, accusing it of being insensitive and distorting the budget of every household. The party also displayed empty LPG cylinders and 'chulhas' at a press conference here to highlight the issue of steep LPG prices. Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate urged the government to bring down prices of LPG cylinders to provide relief to the common people in the country. She said the government has initiated the very steep hike on LPG cylinders by raising it by Rs 25 per cylinder, which is now being sold at Rs 860 per cylinder in Delhi and is touching almost Rs 1000 in various parts of the country. "Our one and only demand is please bring some respite to people, think about the plight of people and bring down prices of LPG cylinders. This is anti-women and anti-people and due to high prices people are forced to go back to using cow dung and firewood," she told reporters. "We do hope that an insensitive government intoxicated on power will pay some attention and bring some respite to people. This is absolutely immoral and there is no word to describe this," she said. Shrinate said as per Saudi Aramco, which decides on prices of gas, the price actually comes to Rs 600 but why are we paying Rs 260 more. “In the last eight or nine months alone, prices of LPG cylinders have gone up by Rs 265, which is almost 44 percent,” she said. She also alleged that the government is not paying any subsidy on LPG cylinders and there is no difference between the market and controlled prices. On the much-touted Ujjwala Yojna, she said the reality is that beneficiaries of the scheme cannot afford a cylinder at Rs 800 at a time when 97 per cent of people are earning less than what they were three years back and 23 crore people have gone below the poverty line. "At what stage will the government realise that during the economic crisis, when people have lost jobs and their wages have gone down and when people are looking for employment opportunities, they should not distort their home budgets," she said. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra charged that the government's "collection scheme" is flourishing by increasing prices of LPG every month. "On July 1, Modi ji's government increased the price of LPG by Rs 25 and on August 17 again increased it by Rs 25. By showing the dream of Ujjwala, the 'collection scheme' of the BJP government is flourishing by increasing the prices of LPG every month," she said in a tweet in Hindi. Congress leader Alka Lamba said women in the national capital are buying 'chulhas' from old Delhi and what would they be doing in other parts of the country. It would be better if 11 women ministers meet Prime minister Modi and tell him to bring down prices of LPG, she said, alleging that the government is trying to divert the attention of the people by raising non-issues. Delhi Congress chief Amrita Dhawan said the prime minister should resign if he is unable to control prices of LPG.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-303
18-08-2021||India||Jammu and Kashmir DGP orders immediate action against cops who beat up scribes||Jammu and Kashmir police chief Dilbag Singh on Wednesday directed "immediate action" against a police officer involved in the beating of journalists during a Muharram procession in the city, terming it "undesirable behaviour". The incident occurred on Tuesday when photojournalists were performing their duty of covering the procession in the city. Police, unable to control the procession, targeted the photojournalists and charged them with batons besides rouging them up physically. Several photographers including S Irfan of the PTI, Waseem Andrabi of the Hindustan Times and Sajjad Hamid of Free Press Journal, whose camera was also broken, were injured. Taking cognisance of the incident, Singh directed Srinagar SSP Sandeep Chaudhary to take immediate action. "J&K DGP Dilbag Singh took a serious view of the undesirable behaviour with some media men in Srinagar yesterday. SSP Srinagar directed to take immediate action against the erring police officer," Jammu and Kashmir Police said on its official Twitter handle. The police, after roughing up the journalists on Tuesday, also detained a few Shia mourners at Jehangir Chowk in the city as they tried to take out a procession to mark the eighth day of the 10-day Muharram mourning period. The traditional Muharram procession used to pass through the areas of Abi Guzar, Lal Chowk and Dalgate areas, but has been banned since the eruption of militancy in 1990. The pictures and videos of the incident were uploaded on social media as journalists protested the police action. Kashmir Press Photographers Association (KPPA) condemned the use of force by police and termed its action "unjustified and uncalled for". The Kashmir Press Club condemned the assault and demanded action against the policemen involved in the incident as well as sensitisation of the police force to ensure media freedom is respected. Leaders cutting across political lines had on Tuesday denounced the incident, with National Conference (NC) vice president Omar Abdullah saying the police action was unfortunate and expressed hope that Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha will ensure such incidents are not repeated. People's Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti also took to Twitter to highlight the issue saying, "Media is spending hours debating the human tragedy and unfolding crisis in Afghanistan but will they speak up for their own community in Kashmir who were beaten to pulp today by security forces for doing their job?" The Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Conference (JKPC) led by Sajad Lone condemned the police action and said, "Merciless beating of journalists is highly condemnable. We express serious concern over such repeated acts of use of force on the media fraternity without any accountability. Surprisingly, the upholders of the law are out to demolish the founding principles of law." Apni Party senior vice president Ghulam Hassan Mir termed the thrashing of media persons as undemocratic.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-303

All four are teachers at the Bakhtar University in Kabul, which was overrun by the Taliban three days ago. "We have reached out to every possible forum in India and we are hoping that the government will do something to ensure our immediate evacuation. I have not stepped out of the campus in two days and every time there is a commotion outside, my heart skips a beat," Mohd Aasif Shah told PTI over the phone. Shah, who is a resident of Kashmir and has been teaching economics at the Kabul-based varsity for four years, said he like his colleagues fear the current atmosphere following the unexpected turn of events. "I had plans to go back on Monday. I even had my ticket booked but the situation was rapidly changing. It took me hours to get to the airport and the sight at the airport was like the entire Kabul had gathered there. The flight was cancelled and I had no choice, but to return to the university hostel," he said. Shah had returned to Afghanistan two months back after the government decided to conduct offline examinations. "My family used to be here with me in Kabul. We all went back to India after the Covid outbreak, and classes were online. However, the government decided to hold exams offline. So only I came back for two months and I was to return after the exams were over," he said. Syed Abid Hussain from Bihar, who teaches marketing at the university, said so far everybody is safe but considering the situation, "we do not want to live in this uncertainty". "We have tried to get in touch with the embassy as well as the Ministry of External Affairs. We have not heard from them yet but I am confident that the government must be putting efforts for our safe and quick evacuation from Kabul," he said. Adil Rasool from Kashmir, whose wife is there with him at the varsity said, "We are just praying that the situation does not get any worse than this and we are able to go home safely." Right now everybody is inside the campus and waiting for a positive development from the Indian embassy or the government, said Rasool, who has been teaching management at the university since 2017. Afroz Alam from Jharkhand, who teaches computer science at the university, said so far there has been no bloodshed but the fear remains. "There has been no bloodshed outside, we have not heard gun shots too in the city but the scare remains whether this is momentary. The campus is huge, we do not have to move outside for necessities too. I am just hoping for safe and quick evacuation from here," he said. Two days after Kabul fell to the Taliban, India on Tuesday completed the evacuation of all its diplomats and other staff members from the Afghan capital under a "difficult and complicated" exercise, effectively closing its mission for the second time since 1996 when the militant group captured power. The mission to evacuate close to 200 people including the Indian envoy and other staffers in two military aircraft was accomplished with support from the US, a day after the Kabul airport witnessed unprecedented scenes of desperate residents rushing into it in an attempt to flee the country fearing the Taliban's brutality. Indian Ambassador to Afghanistan Rudrendra Tandon told media persons that the situation in Kabul is complex and "quite fluid" and that the remaining Indians stuck in the city will be brought back home when the commercial flight services resume. On its part, the Ministry of External Affairs has said that the focus now would be to ensure the safe return of all Indian nationals from the Afghan capital in view of the prevailing situation in the country, adding India's visa services will continue through an e-Emergency visa facility and it has been extended to Afghan nationals. The Taliban swept across the country this month, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities in the backdrop of withdrawal of the US forces that began on May 1.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-303

18-08-2021||India||Mehbooba Mufti's mother appears before ED in money laundering case||Mother of former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti on Wednesday appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) here in a case related to money laundering, officials said. Gulshan Nazir, who is in her late seventies, came to the ED office along with her daughter at the agency's office located in the civil lines area here, they said. Nazir, the wife of former union Home minister and ex-chief minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, had earlier been summoned on three occasions, a move which was termed by the PDP as a political vendetta against the party which has been opposing the abrogation of the special status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. The criminal case filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) is linked to the recovery of at least two diaries by the ED after raids on an alleged associate of Mehbooba. The diaries contain the details of some purported payments made from the chief minister's discretionary fund in alleged contravention of rules, the officials said. These funds are alleged to have been diverted during the People's Democratic Party (PDP) rule in the erstwhile state. A few lakh rupees from these funds are alleged to have been transferred into the accounts of Nazir and some others, and the ED wants to question her about it, the officials said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-303

Special Judge Geetanjali Goel passed the order in a virtual hearing in the case related to Pushkar's death in a luxury hotel here. Taking to Twitter, Tharoor posted his statement and said, "I would like to express my humble thanks to Judge Geetanjali Goel for her orders today, discharging me from the charges levied by the Delhi Police, which I have consistently described as preposterous." Tharoor said the ruling brings a significant conclusion to the "long nightmare which had enveloped" him after the tragic passing of his wife. "I have weathered dozens of unfounded accusations and media vilification patiently, sustained by my faith in the Indian judiciary, which today stands vindicated," the former Union minister said. In our justice system, the process is all too often the punishment, he noted. "Nonetheless, the fact that justice has been done, at last, will allow all of us in the family to mourn Sunanda in peace," he said. In his statement, Tharoor also thanked lawyers, particularly Vikas Pahwa and Gaurav Gupta, for all they had done to bring the case to this conclusion. During the arguments, while police had sought framing of various charges, including 306 (abetment of suicide), senior advocate Pahwa, appearing for Tharoor, told the court that the investigation conducted by the SIT completely exonerated the politician of all the charges levelled against him. Pahwa had sought Tharoor's discharge in the case, saying there was no evidence against him to prove the offence. Pushkar was found dead in a suite of a luxury hotel in the city on the night of January 17, 2014. The couple was staying in the hotel, as the official bungalow of Tharoor was being renovated at that time. Tharoor was charged under Sections 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) as well as 306 of the Indian Penal Code by Delhi Police, but was not arrested in the case. Tharoor was granted anticipatory bail in the matter by a Sessions court on July 5, 2018. Following that order, a magisterial court converted the anticipatory bail into regular bail after he appeared before it on July 7 in pursuance to the summons issued by the Metropolitan Magistrate in the matter.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-303
18-08-2021||India||Samajwadi Party MP booked for sedition over comments supporting Taliban||Samajwadi Party MP Shafiqur Rehman Barq has been booked for sedition following his recent remarks allegedly defending the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan and equating it with India's own freedom struggle, police said on Wednesday. He was charged under Indian Penal Code section 124A (sedition) following a complaint from BJP leader Rajesh Singhal on Tuesday, Superintendent of Police Chakresh Mishra said. Singhal in his complaint said that Barq's "controversial statement comes in the category of sedition", he said. The MP has been also booked under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language) and 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), Mishra said. Besides Barq, two others -- Mohammad Muqueem and Chaudhary Faizan have also been booked under these sections, the officer said, adding that the matter is being probed. Following the Sambhal MP's remarks, Samajwadi Party (SP) workers Muqueem and Faizan posted material on social media in support of the Taliban, according to the FIR. Responding to questions from reporters on Monday, Lok Sabha member Barq had said the Taliban wanted to free their country and it was Afghanistan's internal matter. He had called the Taliban a force that did not allow Russia or the United States to establish themselves in Afghanistan, "and now they want to run their own country". The MP had said that when India was under British Rule, the entire country fought for independence. "They want to be free. This is their personal matter. How can we interfere?" the SP legislator had said on developments in Afghanistan. Endorsing the Taliban takeover, Barq had said the Afghans want to run their own country in the manner they wanted." The remarks drew sharp criticism from Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. In the state legislative council, the chief minister on Tuesday slammed the opposition MP. "He was shamelessly supporting the Taliban. It means supporting their barbaric act. We are a parliamentary democracy. Where are we heading? We are supporting people who are a blot on humanity," the CM added. Asked to comment on the MP's remarks, Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said he had not personally heard them. "But if this type of statement has been given then there is no difference between that person and Imran Khan." Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday had appeared to endorse the Taliban's takeover of Kabul, saying Afghanistan has broken the "shackles of slavery".||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-303
18-08-2021||India||Chief Justice slams media speculation on judges' appointments ||Chief Justice of India N V Ramana on Wednesday termed "very unfortunate" certain "speculations and reports" in the media about Collegium meeting regarding the appointment of judges in the Supreme Court. CJI Ramana, while speaking in the ceremonial function to bid farewell to Justice Navin Sinha who is retiring, said the process of appointment of judges is sacrosanct and has dignity attached to it and the media must understand and recognise its sanctity. "On this occasion, I want to take the liberty to express my concern about certain speculations and reports in the media. You are all aware we need to appoint judges to this court. The process is ongoing. Meetings will be held and decisions will be taken. The process of appointment of judges is sacrosanct and has certain dignity attached to it. My media friends must understand and recognise the sanctity of this process," he said. The CJI said that as an institution, the apex court holds the freedom of media and the rights of individuals in high esteem and today's reflections in some sections of the media, pending the process, even before formalising the resolution is counter-productive. "There were instances of deserving career progression of bright talents getting marred because of such irresponsible reporting and speculation. This is very unfortunate and I am extremely upset about it," he said. The CJI also lauded the tremendous amount of maturity and responsibility displayed by majority of senior journalists and media houses in showing restraint and not speculating on such a serious matter. "Such professional journalists and ethical media are the real strength of the Supreme Court in particular and democracy in general. You are part of our system. I expect all the stakeholders to uphold the integrity and dignity of this institution," he said. The head of the judiciary was referring to media reports which said the Collegium, headed by the CJI, is understood to have recommended nine names for appointment as judges in the top court, media had reported earlier.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-303
18-08-2021||India||Police oppose Natasha Narwal's plea seeking modification of bail condition||Delhi Police on Wednesday opposed JNU student Natasha Narwal's plea, seeking modification in the bail condition asking her not to leave the national capital without the court's permission, stating that she may destroy evidence. Narwal, an accused in three north-east Delhi riots cases, sought modification of a 2020 bail order in which she was directed to not leave Delhi, saying she has to travel outside for research purposes for her PhD and to visit her native place but has to seek the court's permission every time. During the hearing, Additional Public Prosecutor Rajeev Krishan Sharma opposed the plea and told the court that Narwal is a conspirator and may destroy evidence or run away if the condition of not leaving Delhi is changed. "So much evidence may get destroyed. We have great suspicion and apprehension. The investigation is still going on, the prosecutor, representing the police," told Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat. Sharma further said that there are conspiracy charges against her and a conspirator is always the most dangerous person as they can destroy the evidence and save themselves. "Tomorrow if they go abroad or run away, who will catch them?" he asked. "When they were conspiring to spread the riots, they were also doing PhD. Many people died. The court can understand what they are doing in the name of PhD," The prosecutor added. He said that Narwhal must move an application and inform the police whenever she is going outside the city. Because of this condition, they are not able to cause havoc and destroy evidence. Kindly consider the gravity of the case, he requested the court. Meanwhile, advocates Kunal Negi and Adit S Pujari, representing Narwal, told the court she is an accused in three cases but the court while granting bail in the other two matters, did not impose any such condition on her. "There is no such condition even in the conspiracy case. We will inform the IO prior to travel if the condition is modified," they emphasized. Narwal, along with several others, has been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in the case and they are accused of being the "masterminds" of the February 2020 violence, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-303

The Vande Bharat Mission was carried out last year to bring back Indians stranded in foreign countries after the suspension of regular international flights following the oubreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. "The Indian government will bring its citizens back to their homes from Afghanistan, like we did in the Vande Bharat Mission, through Air India and the Indian Air Force (IAF) planes, whichever way is possible," Scindia told reporters late Tuesday night in Madhya Pradesh's Shajapur, where he reached as part of his 'Jan Ashirwad Yatra'. Scindia said the Union government had started the evacuation from Afghanistan last Friday. "The evacuation process continued for three days. But, when a flight was about to take off on Sunday, NOTAM (a notice to alert aircraft pilots of potential hazards along a flight route) was received following gunshots fired at the Kabul airport," he said. Following the NOTAM, the airspace over Kabul was closed, so the evacuation process was hindered on Monday, the minister said. Later, an IAF plane went to Kabul on Tuesday and brought back Indian citizens, he said. We will leave no stone unturned to bring back all our citizens from Afghanistan. We already did it earlier under the Vande Bharat Mission, the minister said. After starting his 'Jan Ashirwad Yatra' from MP's Dewas district on Tuesday morning, Scindia reached Shajapur late at night. As part of the tour, various newly-inducted Union ministers are reaching out to people and informing them about the welfare schemes of the Centre. Besides Scindia, Union minister S P Singh Baghel also carried out a tour in Gwalior district on Tuesday.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-304
18-08-2021||India||SC dismisses Maha govt plea against CBI probe into transfer, posting of cops by Deshmukh||The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea of the Maharashtra government seeking to set aside two paragraphs related to transfer and posting of police officers, reinstatement of an officer from the CBI's FIR against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said that it is inclined to interfere with the July 22 order of the Bombay High Court and dismissed the petition. The top court said that it cannot dilute the direction of a constitutional court ordering a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe by drawing a line for the agency on which aspect the investigation should be done. "CBI has to investigate all aspects of the allegations and we cannot limit them. This will be like denuding the powers of a constitutional court," the bench said. It said that an impression is being created that the state is trying to protect the former home minister by not allowing the probe on the aspect of transfer and posting of police officers and reinstatement of additional police inspector Sachin Waze. Advocate Rahul Chitnis, appearing for the Maharashtra government, said the state has withdrawn consent for the CBI probe and the High Court direction for a probe was limited to allegations of collection of money from bars and restaurants and not on transfer, posting of police officers and reinstatement of Waje into the police force. On July 22, the High Court said the CBI can inquire into the transfer and postings of police personnel and the reinstatement of Waze in the Mumbai Police force "so far as this has a nexus with Maharashtra's former home minister Anil Deshmukh and his associates". The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea of the Maharashtra government seeking to set aside two paragraphs related to transfer and posting of police officers, reinstatement of an officer from the CBI's FIR against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said that it is not inclined to interfere with the July 22 order of the Bombay High Court. The top court said that it cannot dilute the direction of a constitutional court ordering a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe by drawing a line for the agency on which aspect the investigation should be done. CBI has to investigate all aspects of the allegations and we cannot limit them. This will be like denuding the powers of a constitutional court, the bench said. It said that an impression is being created that the state is trying to protect the former home minister by not allowing the probe on the aspect of transfer and posting of police officers and reinstatement of additional police inspector Sachin Waze. "Which state government is going to order CBI, when the allegations are against its own home minister or any other minister. It is the court, which will have to exercise its power to order the probe and that what High Court did," the bench said. The top court said that the Maharashtra government should allow a free and fair investigation by CBI into the issue and it should be open as there is nothing to hide. Advocate Rahul Chitnis, appearing for the Maharashtra government, said the state has withdrawn consent for the CBI probe and the High Court direction for a probe was limited to allegations of collection of money from bars and restaurants and not on transfer, posting of police officers and reinstatement of Waje into the police force. He said that letter of former Mumbai commissioner of Police Param Bir Singh to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray only alleged the collection of Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants. Chitnis said that Bombay High Court had said that Param Bir Singh can avail remedy before the appropriate forum with respect to undue consideration taken by then minister for transfer and posting of police officials. The bench said that like police has the power to investigate anything related to the FIR registered, similarly, CBI has to investigate all aspects related to the averment made in the letter of Param Bir Singh. "We cannot draw a line and tell CBI that you can investigate this and you cannot investigate that. It has to look into the manner the transfer and posting was done during the tenure of former minister," the bench said. The top court said that investigation is not against the state but against a former minister and state should be open to the investigation by CBI as there is nothing to hide. "Sorry, we are not inclined to interfere with the High Court verdict," the bench said and dismissed the petition. On July 22, the High Court said the CBI can inquire into the transfer and postings of police personnel and the reinstatement of Waze in the Mumbai Police force "so far as this has a nexus with Maharashtra's former home minister Anil Deshmukh and his associates". The High Court, in its judgment, had remarked that the allegations of corruption and misconduct levelled by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh against Deshmukh and if the reinstatement of Waze in 2020 after so many years of suspension had any quid pro quo (a favour/advantage granted in return for something), then it is a matter of investigation. The court had dismissed a petition filed by the Maharashtra government seeking that two paragraphs from the CBI's FIR against Deshmukh be set aside. While one paragraph is about allegations (of extortion) levelled against the NCP leader by former Assistant Police Inspector (API) Waze, dismissed from service after his arrest in the Antilia bomb scare case, the second one pertains to alleged corruption in transfers and postings of police officials. The investigating agency (CBI), in our view, can legitimately carry on its inquiry into the transfer and postings of police personnel and the reinstatement of Sachin Waze in the police force after 15 years, so far as this has a nexus with the former home minister (Deshmukh) and his associates, the court had said. The high court had noted that the allegations of extortion of money and attempts to influence investigations and transfer of particular officers to achieve these objectives "form an inseparable part of the alleged conspiracy". In March this year, Singh, in a letter to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, had levelled allegations of corruption against Deshmukh. The CBI, on April 21 this year, registered an FIR against Deshmukh on charges of corruption and misuse of official positions. The FIR was lodged after the agency conducted a preliminary enquiry against the NCP leader following an order from the HC on April 5. Waze, now in jail, had claimed he was asked to collect money from bar and restaurant owners in Mumbai allegedly on instructions of Deshmukh, who has repeatedly denied the allegations against him.

A bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana issued notices to the Centre and the Bengal government on the plea and posted it for hearing on August 25. Advocate Saurabh Mishra, appearing for the petitioner, told the bench that they have challenged the notification issued by the state government constituting the Commission of Inquiry on the ground of jurisdiction. We will issue notice, the bench, also comprising justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose said. Former Supreme Court judge Justice Madan B Lokur and former chief justice of Calcutta High Court Justice Jyotirmay Bhattacharya are the members of the Commission of Inquiry announced by the West Bengal government last month. An international media consortium has reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on the list of potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus spyware.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-304
18-08-2021||India||Sunanda Pushkar death case: Delhi court discharges Shashi Tharoor||A Delhi court on Wednesday discharged senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor in a case related to his wife Sunanda Pushkar's death in a luxury hotel here. Special Judge Geetanjali Goel passed the order in a virtual hearing. Tharoor thanked the judge and said it was absolute torture for the last seven-and-a-half years and that it was a great relief. During the arguments, while police had sought framing of various charges, including 306 (abetment of suicide), senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, appearing for Tharoor, told the court that the investigation conducted by the SIT completely exonerated the politician of all the charges levelled against him. Pushkar was found dead in a suite of a luxury hotel in the city on the night of January 17, 2014. The couple was staying in the hotel as the official bungalow of Tharoor was being renovated at that time. Tharoor was charged under sections 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 306 of the Indian Penal Code by the Delhi Police, but was not arrested in the case. He was granted bail on July 5, 2018.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-304
18-08-2021||India||Govt refusing to divulge details in public a confession that spyware was used, says Chidambaram||Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Wednesday said the solicitor general telling the Supreme Court that the government has information which he cannot divulge in public by way of an affidavit is a "confession" that software-spyware was used, and sought to know if it was Pegasus and for what purpose it was used. The Centre on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that divulging information on whether the country uses spyware like Pegasus or not would involve national security aspect as enemies of the nation or those indulging in terror activities would change or modulate their software. Reacting to the development, Chidambaram said, "SG tells SC that the government has information which he cannot divulge in public by way of affidavit. That is a confession that software-spyware was used. For what, we do not know." "We want to know if that spyware-software was called Pegasus and for what purpose was it used," the former home minister said in a series of tweets. "If the government answers these two questions, the remaining questions will answer themselves in due course," Chidambaram said. On Tuesday night, Chidambaram had tweeted that the Israel-based NSO Group has admitted and said that Pegasus is spyware and is used to hack phones. "Why is the government reluctant to answer the question, 'Did any of the agencies buy Pegasus spyware and use it?' We want a straight answer," he had said. "If it has not come today, it will certainly come on a future day. The Supreme Court must demand an answer to the question. I hope the Court will," Chidambaram had tweeted on Tuesday. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told a bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana that those involved in terror activities may take pre-emptive steps if the government divulges details of which software is used for various purposes including interception. The apex court, which made clear that it did not want the government to disclose anything which compromises national security, issued notice to the Centre on the batch of pleas seeking an independent probe into the alleged Pegasus snooping matter and posted the matter for hearing after 10 days. During the arguments, Mehta said this cannot be a subject matter of affidavit and public debate and the government has said in its limited affidavit that it will constitute a committee of experts to examine all the aspects of the Pegasus issue.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-304

18-08-2021||India||Jaishankar discusses Afghan situation in bilateral meetings with UNSG, counterparts||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar discussed the situation in Afghanistan after the Taliban seized power in Kabul in his bilateral meetings here, including with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Jaishankar arrived in New York Monday as the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting on the situation in Afghanistan, the second time in just over the 10 days that the powerful UN body met under India's Presidency for the month of August to discuss the unravelling situation in the war-torn country. Following his meeting with Guterres in the UN headquarters on Tuesday, the minister tweeted, Good to meet UN Secretary General @antonioguterres. Our discussions focused on Afghanistan, following upon the Security Council meeting yesterday. He also met Estonia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Eva-Maria Liimets and as UNSC members, discussed our working together on maritime and cyber security and other global issues. Exchanged views on the developments in Afghanistan. Look forward to her presence at the Council meeting tomorrow". Liimets described her meeting with Jaishankar as important and said in a tweet that they talked about the "uncertain" situation in Afghanistan and India's first UNSC Presidency. Good cooperation between Estonia and India, this year celebrating 30 years of diplomatic relations, she added. Jaishankar will chair two high-level signature events this week under India's current Security Council Presidency. As India assumed the Presidency of the 15-nation Council for the month of August, it had outlined maritime security, counter-terrorism and peacekeeping as the focus areas. The minister will chair an open debate Wednesday on technology and peacekeeping under the overarching theme of Protecting the Protectors'. He will lay a wreath at the Peacekeepers Memorial in a ceremony along with Guterres. India and the UN will exchange an MoU in support of partnership for technology in peacekeeping. Jaishankar will also chair a high-level event on August 19 on counter-terrorism during which the Council will discuss the Secretary General's six-monthly report on the threat posed by ISIL/Da'esh, under the agenda item Threats to International Peace and Security caused by Terrorist Acts'. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had chaired the virtual high-level open debate on maritime security that was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Blinken. Jaishankar said he also discussed the evolving situation in Afghanistan with French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian. We will continue to coordinate in the UN Security Council. Thank him for evacuating 21 Indian nationals from Kabul to Paris, he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-304
18-08-2021||India||Afghan exodus demolishes Centre’s citizenship law excuse||The Centre has said that it would prioritise taking in Hindus and Sikhs from Afghanistan — a move that drew comparisons to a contentious 2019 citizenship law that discriminates against Muslims. The Union home ministry said it would introduce “emergency visas” to allow Afghans to stay in India for six months. It did not specifically mention any religion, which, on  the face of it, suggests  the visa is open to all. Muslims make up the majority of those seeking to leave Afghanistan. But a tweet stoked fears. “We are in constant touch with the Sikh and Hindu community leaders in Kabul,” S. Jaishankar, the external affairs minister, said on Twitter. “Their welfare will get our priority attention.” That distinction prompted condemnation from some corners. “Ashamed that the Government of India response now is to look at desperate Afghan refugees not as humans fleeing persecution and sure death, but from the view of whether or not they’re Muslim,” Kavita Krishnan, CPIML politburo member, said on Twitter. On Monday, the India foreign ministry spokesperson had also mentioned Hindus and Sikhs but he did not specifically say that they would be given priority. The spokesperson had added that India would stand by Afghan nationals who had been the country’s partners in development initiatives. India also drew criticism after numerous seats were left empty on an air force flight on Tuesday that evacuated Indian citizens and officials from the country’s embassy in Kabul. India has previously granted visas of a longer duration to Afghans fleeing persecution, irrespective of their religion. Many Afghans migrated to India when the Taliban took over about two decades ago. Some have settled in New Delhi, where a shopping district popularly named “Little Kabul” comes alive every evening. The Narendra Modi government had passed the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act in December 2019 that proposes to fast-track Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Parsi and Christian communities who came to India before December 31, 2014. The rules under the Act are yet to be notified. “One of the justifications for CAA was ‘Muslims cannot face persecution in Islamic countries’, an always-specious argument now more exposed by the horrific images of refugees (mostly Muslim) fleeing Afghanistan, clinging to & falling from wings of planes in the process,” Krishnan tweeted. The new category of electronic visa announced by the Centre to fast-track applications is meant for Afghan nationals who wish to leave the Taliban-controlled country. The visa category is called e-Emergency X-Misc Visa and it does not mention any religion. Sources in the government said the new visa category was expected to benefit religious minorities in Afghanistan, mostly Hindus and Sikhs, who are stranded in the country and fear prosecution by the Taliban. “MHA reviews visa provisions in view of the current situation in Afghanistan. A new category of electronic visa called “e-Emergency X-Misc Visa” introduced to fast-track visa applications for entry into India,” said a statement from the home ministry. Sources said these visas will be initially valid for six months and are being granted to facilitate the stay of Afghans in India. The visas will be granted only after security clearance. There is, however, no clarity yet on what will happen after the expiry of the six-month validity. A ministry official said: “India does not have a refugee policy. India grants shelter to foreigners facing persecution in their countries on a case-by-case basis. Our mission in Afghanistan is shut now and people are being allowed to get online visas. All these applications will first be cleared by security agencies”. The controversial CAA had triggered widespread protests as many feared that coupled with the planned nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC), it would result in lakhs of Muslims losing their citizenship. Following the passage of the law in Parliament, the country had witnessed widespread protests leading to the death of over 100 people in police firing and related violence.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-304
18-08-2021||India||India evacuates nationals posted in Kabul mission||India pulled the shutters down on its diplomatic presence in Afghanistan on Tuesday morning, evacuating its nationals posted in the Kabul mission after tapping into the newly established back-channels with the Taliban. However, several Indians continue to be stranded in Afghanistan. New Delhi does not seem to be planning another evacuation right away, awaiting instead the resumption of commercial operations at Kabul airport. “The Government of India is committed to the safe return of all Indian nationals and will institute flight arrangements once Kabul airport is open for commercial operations,’’ the external affairs ministry said in a statement on Tuesday evening, pointing out that the main challenge for travel to and from Afghanistan is the operational status of the Kabul airport. There is no official figure on the number of Indians stranded in Afghanistan. “We understand that a number of Indians are stranded in that country, some of whom are employed by third country organisations. Our immediate priority is to obtain accurate information about all Indian nationals currently in Afghanistan. They and / or their employers are requested to urgently share the relevant details with MEA’s Special Afghanistan Cell,’’ the statement added. That New Delhi was pulling out ambassador Rudrendra Tandon, other diplomats and Indian staff from the Kabul embassy — the last of the five diplomatic offices India had in Afghanistan — was announced by external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi in the morning after the Indian Air Force flight ferrying 150 passengers had taken off. The C-17 Globemaster flew back to India via Iran and landed in Jamnagar, Gujarat, before arriving at the Hindon air base on the outskirts of the national capital late in the  afternoon after a tense night at the Kabul airport. Briefing journalists at Jamnagar airport, Tandon said any Indian who managed to reach the embassy in Kabul was taken into the mission and evacuated on this flight. About the fate of others stranded, he said some of them had reached out to the mission. “They were too far away in areas that were no longer possible to access.” The evacuation of the mission, he said, was carried out in two phases, adding that India has not abandoned the Afghan people. With the embassy itself surrounded by the Taliban, accessing the Kabul airport was an uphill task and it is in this that the back channels with the Islamist group came in handy. The entire contingent managed to reach the airport shortly after midnight for a flight that eventually left only on Tuesday morning. In a tweet, without going into details, external affairs minister S. Jaishankar hinted at the risks involved in moving so many Indians, including diplomats, through the Taliban-controlled Kabul. “Movement of the Indian Ambassador and the Embassy staff from Kabul to India was a difficult and complicated exercise. Thank all those whose cooperation and facilitation made it possible.” During the night while India was awaiting the lift-off of the evacuation flight, Jaishankar had a phone conversation with US secretary of state Antony Blinken. The US currently controls the Kabul airport, and Jaishankar tweeted that he “underlined the urgency of restoring airport operations in Kabul”. After the flight landed in Hindon, Tandon attended a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security on Afghanistan, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, amid reports of the return of Taliban co-founder Mullah Baradar from Doha and the country’s first Vice-President Amrullah Saleh claiming that he is the legitimate caretaker President. An ex-spy and a trenchant critic of the Taliban, Saleh is reported to be in Panjshir Valley and in consultations with Ahmad Massoud, son of the legendary anti-Taliban commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, to build a resistance. Saleh said the Constitution provided for a caretaker President in the case of the absence, escape, resignation or death of the incumbent. Since he is in Afghanistan, Saleh claims he is the “legitimate caretaker president”.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-304
18-08-2021||India||JNU academic council approves plan to set up medical school||The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) academic council, headed by a controversial vice-chancellor on extension, has approved a proposal to set up a medical school in what is being seen as a fresh attempt to diffuse the standing of the institution as a celebrated cradle for humanities and social sciences. The initiative of M. Jagadesh Kumar, the vice-chancellor who is on extension after his tenure expired in January this year, also tests a government position that advises caretaker vice-chancellors against taking substantive policy decisions. An email this newspaper sent to the vice-chancellor to ascertain his views elicited no response till Tuesday night. Once the executive council approves the proposal passed on Tuesday by the academic council, the university will start the medical school which will offer courses and integrate modern medicine with traditional medicine. “Academic Council unanimously approved, as per the provisions of JNU Act, 1966, establishing a School of Medical Sciences and an attached Hospital with broad and super-speciality departments including supporting and non-conventional departments,” said a media release issued by rector Rana P. Singh. The media release added: “This School will offer PhD, MD-PhD, MD, MS, DM, MCh and MBBS degree programmes, with an emphasis on modern medicine integrated with traditional medicine and knowledge systems from humanities and social sciences.” The new proposal has attracted criticism on two counts — alleged failure to hold proper deliberations and the lack of power of the in-charge VC to push such a policy agenda. The JNU Teachers Association wrote a letter to the education minister, complaining against the  in-charge VC. JNUTA secretary Moushumi Basu said that the proposal for starting a medical school was not discussed with the related centres like the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health. VC Kumar had set up a committee of subject experts from medical institutions, which endorsed the proposal to set up the medical school. Basu said the schools of engineering and management were started by the JNU in 2018 without proper discussion. Both the schools are yet to establish themselves in terms of quality, she said. Aditya N. Mishra, former president of the Federation of Central Universities Teachers’ Associations, said both the engineering and management schools did not have adequate infrastructure and faculty, affecting the quality. “Considering the standard of JNU, both the schools are not able to attract best talents,” Mishra said. A student of the engineering school said it did not have a building of its own. Besides, they have been put up in dormitories and a sizable section of faculty members are not regular employees, the student said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-304
18-08-2021||India||Pegasus: SC issues notices to Centre on plea for court-monitored probe||The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued a notice to the Union government on a batch of petitions seeking a court-monitored special investigation into the Pegasus snooping controversy. The  Narendra Modi government, without confirming or denying that the Israeli spyware  was used, told a bench headed by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana that if the truth was divulged, it would only help terrorists. The Centre, represented by solicitor-general Tushar Mehta, said there was nothing wrong if surveillance was carried out for the sake of national security. The petitioners want to know if the Centre bought Pegasus and used it to snoop on several Indians, including Opposition politicians, judges, journalists and activists. Although the government renewed the offer to set up an expert panel to examine the allegations, the apex court did not immediately concede the plea. The court indicated that if necessary, at a later stage, the court may consider the request or set up its own panel. Mehta declined to file any additional affidavit as suggested on Monday by the apex court, which, along with the petitioners, was not satisfied with the two-page affidavit filed by the additional secretary, electronics and information technology ministry. “According to me, my affidavit suffices but as a responsible government I am saying we will form a committee and submit a report before this court…. If there is an illegitimate use, then it cannot be countenanced by this court. There can’t be anything more fair than this,” the government’s law officer contended. Justice Ramana said: “You understand we are not asking you to divulge what you don’t want to. We are not here for that. We are not compelling you. We are thinking, we will issue notice, let us see. In the meanwhile… we will see if we have to constitute a committee and see what to do.” The Chief Justice added:  “We will see that. This is all at stage of admission. We had thought a comprehensive reply will come but it was a limited reply. We will see, we will also think and consider what can be done.  We will discuss what needs to be done, if a committee of experts needs to be made, or some other committee has to be set up….” Focusing on national security, Mehta said: “Mr (Kapil) Sibal (representing two petitioners) pointed out yesterday that there is a statutory mechanism in the form of an act as well as  rules which permit interception as per the statutorily prescribed procedure. …This is necessary for national security purposes and to combat terrorists…. “It is nobody’s case that under the IP Rules, 2000, a software cannot be used for the purpose of national security and to combat terrorism. They want the Government of India to divulge which software is not used. No country would ever reveal which software they have used or not used. Then the persons who are being intercepted may take pre-emptive or corrective steps.” Mehta added: “We know the IT encryption rules are there for state security, and national security presupposes that these software can be used. These software are purchased by every country, they (the petitioners) want it to be divulged if the software has not been used. If we divulge this, then the terrorists and their sleeper cells… can take preventive steps.” “…These are national security issues and we cannot hide anything from the court. This has to be before a committee and it cannot be a subject to public debate. Some web portals are weaving a narrative that some software is used. If I ask the government to divulge this fact before the court, then I will fail in my duty,” Mehta told the bench that includes Justices Surya Kant and Anriuddha Bose. Mehta was making an oblique reference to Section 69 of the IT Act, which empowers the Centre and state government or their authorised officers to  “intercept, monitor or decrypt or cause to be intercepted or monitored or decrypted any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource” to uphold the sovereignty, defence and security of the country. Responding to the solicitor-general’s submission, Justice Surya Kant said that as a court, the bench does not expect the government to disclose anything impinging on national security but wondered why the Centre was not willing to file a detailed affidavit. Justice Surya Kant said: “We, as a court, and you, as the solicitor-general, and all lawyers, as officers of the court, none of us would like to compromise the security of the nation. For the defence of the nation, we are not going to disclose anything. “Whatever mechanism the defence ministry has evoked, we will not ask you to disclose any such thing. But here there are some persons of eminence (the petitioners) who are alleging snooping and hacking of phones.… “Now, this can be done only with the permission of a competent authority. What is the problem, if the authority files an affidavit before us?” Mehta, however, insisted that the government was willing to disclose whether there was any authorised or unauthorised interception before the expert inquiry committee proposed by the Centre. The expert committee in turn can place the report before the court. But, at the same time, the government is not willing to make a statement in the open court lest it enters the public domain. The solicitor-general said: “What is intended should come by way of an affidavit before Your Lordships or a report by the committee. I am not saying that I won’t disclose this to anyone. I am only saying I won’t tell this publicly. We can say this before the expert committee. “I wish to make it clear that it’s not that I don’t want to disclose by affidavit…. Let me say it before a committee whose report will later come to Your Lordships.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-305
18-08-2021||India||Afghan students in Indian varsities request visas, hostel stay||The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has left several Afghan students in India desperate for visa extensions and funding because of uncertainty not just about their careers but also their lives. Despite assurances against reprisals by the Taliban, Afghan students currently attending online classes of Indian universities from home are keen on fleeing to India. Indian faculty in Afghan varsities have also tweeted SOS messages to be rescued from the anarchy that now prevails in that country. Mohammad Shafiq Sultan, a finance ministry employee of the deposed regime, is awaiting the results of the final semester of MA in international relations and area studies in Jawaharlal Nehru University here. His monthly scholarship of around Rs 20,000 from the Indian Council for Cultural Relations has stopped. Sultan was on Tuesday asked to vacate his hostel room by September 22. “I have been unable to speak to my family in Wardak province for a fortnight. Friends back home have warned me that the Taliban is investigating those who worked for the (earlier) government. They are saying do not come home as I may not have the fortune of a trial as there have been extra-judicial killings. They will persecute me as they think that I may have been brainwashed by going to India,” he told The Telegraph. He added: “I can’t survive for more than a couple of months on savings and help from friends. I can’t afford to pay commercial rent if I am evicted from the hostel. My wages for the last two years — which I would have received once I reported back to work with my degree — are now gone as the government I worked for does not exist any more. We have been pleading with the ICCR to increase the duration of our stipend. I am confident of clearing the entrance for PhD but I can’t survive without the scholarship nor can I go back for fear of my life.” Afghans have been the biggest beneficiaries of the ICCR scholarships with around two-thirds of all such scholarships awarded going to students from that country. At the moment, it is unclear if the new regime will continue the agreement with India under which these scholarships are given. The ICCR did not respond to queries on whether any form of relief would be given to scholarship holders in India and Afghanistan. According to the latest All India Survey of Higher Education report of 2019-20, there were 4,504 Afghan students in India. While institutions such as Delhi University and the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, have reached out to students attending online classes in Afghanistan, and facilitated their visas, the JNU has not. In response to requests from such Afghan students and the JNU Students Union, varsity registrar Ravikesh said on Saturday that “the matter is being looked into” as Delhi’s lockdown regulations include the closure of educational institutions — a clause that does not prevent the JNU from issuing necessary documentation for them to be granted visas to complete their courses in India. A day after the registrar’s note, Kabul was taken over by the Taliban and an exodus at the airport has made air travel difficult. A student of sociology in the JNU, currently in Kabul, told this paper that her family was desperate for her to leave before the Taliban arrived as the possibility of her going out to study seems bleak given their track record. The power supply to her home has now stopped. “My mobile is dying… There is no way of getting out,” she said in a message to this newspaper. Three such students have reached out to the JNUSU. In DU that has facilitated the return of 40 students, a depreciated currency and defunct banking system has made paying guest accommodations too expensive for most students. Iqbal Ahmadzai, a BA (economics) student in Hindu College is currently staying with a well-wisher in JNU’s staff quarters. From Logar province, he spoke of the uneasy calm now as the Taliban finally won a war of attrition in his town and the shooting has stopped, but restrictions have been imposed on women travelling unaccompanied by men, as well as compulsory headscarves. “As I am among the fortunate few to have a place to stay, it is my duty to speak up for most Afghan students who can’t afford PG accommodations. None of us have been given hostels and no reasons have been given for denying us this when we need it the most,” he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-305
18-08-2021||India||Yogi govt to establish Anti-Terrorist Squad in Deoband ||The Yogi Adityanath government has decided to establish a new centre of the Anti-Terrorist Squad in Saharanpur district’s Deoband town, which is home to a Sunni seminary established a century and a half ago. “Listen to the news amid the barbarism of Taliban, Yogiji has decided to open an ATS Commando Centre in Deoband with immediate effect. About one-and-a-half dozen selected ATS officers from across the state would be posted there,” Shalabh Mani Tripathi, an adviser of the state information and publicity department, tweeted on Tuesday. The decision comes months ahead of the Assembly elections. When contacted, a senior member of the 155-year-old Darul Uloom Deoband told The Telegraph: “We have decided not to speak on this issue. We are a reputable university, which doesn’t want to know which office is opening in our town and why.” “There are more intelligence department offices in a small town like Deoband than in Lucknow, the state capital. It is very good for us. We feel secure. We would love to ask the government to open more such offices here so that we can focus on academics while feeling secure,” he added. Although the Darul Uloom Deoband has in the past condemned the Taliban and organised meetings against terrorism, a section of Sangh parivar leaders keep alleging during elections that the seminary is pro-Taliban. An information department officer was quoted as saying to reporters: “About 2,000sqm land has already been earmarked for the ATS office and work will start soon. It is a project close to the heart of Maharajji.” Chief minister Adityanath is called Maharajji by his supporters.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-305
18-08-2021||India||Congress calls bluff on finance minister's oil bonds claim||The Congress on Tuesday rejected as “falsehood” the claim that the prices of petroleum products were high because of oil bonds issued by the previous regime, arguing that the Narendra Modi government was fleecing the poor to fill its coffers and to make up for lower tax collection from the corporates. Former finance minister P. Chidambaram said in a series of tweets: “The finance minister’s statement that servicing oil bonds stands in the way of giving relief on petrol and diesel prices is astonishing. At best the statement is incredible ignorance; at the worst it is motivated malignity.” Congress general secretary Ajay Maken said: “Since 2014-15, the Modi government has spent Rs 73,440 crore on servicing of oil bonds. Against this, they have collected Rs 22.34 lakh crore through taxes on petroleum products. Spending on servicing of oil bonds is barely 3.2 per cent of the tax collection from petroleum products. The real reason is not oil bonds but reduction in subsidy by 12 times and increase of taxes by three times.” The Congress was responding to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s statement on Monday that there will be no cut in excise duty on fuel as they are facing additional burden because of oil bonds issued by the previous UPA government. Arguing that the UPA had reduced fuel prices by issuing oil bonds of Rs 1.44 lakh crore, she had said: “I can’t go by the trickery that was played by previous the UPA government. Due to oil bonds, the burden has come to our government, that’s why we are unable to reduce prices of petrol and diesel.” Sitharaman didn’t release figures to back her charge but the Congress responded with detailed data, saying: “The official figures of the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell reveal that the UPA government gave subsidy on petroleum products to the tune of Rs 1.64 lakh crore in 2012-13 and Rs 1.47 lakh crore in 2013-14. The Modi government drastically reduced this amount year after year and it is just Rs 12,231 crore in 2020-21. “In 2020-21 alone, ‘Modi tax’ on petrol-diesel was Rs 453,812 crore. It is three times more than 2013-14. The BJP government raised central taxes on petrol and diesel by Rs 23.87 and Rs 28.37 per litre in seven years and collected additional Rs 189,711 crore every year.” Maken said: “Since the lockdown, the increase on excise duties on petrol and diesel has surpassed all forms of exploitation and extortion. In the last 15 months, the insensitive government had raised petrol and diesel rates by Rs 32.25 and Rs 27.58 per litre respectively.” Pointing to the denial of benefit to the consumers despite drastic fall in international crude prices, Maken said: “Because of the lowering of corporate tax, the government needs more money to match its spending. The cost of lower corporate tax rates for the government is being borne by citizens in the form of higher petrol and diesel prices. In 2017-18, the corporate tax collections amounted to a total of 3.34 per cent of the GDP and fell to 2.32 per cent of the GDP in 2020-21. This was despite the listed companies registering bumper profits during the financial year.” Maken added: “Corporate taxes have come down primarily on account of the base tax rate being cut from 30 per cent to 22 per cent in September 2019 and to 15 per cent from the earlier 25 per cent for new manufacturing companies. In absolute terms, the total corporate tax collected in 2019-20 had stood at Rs 5.57 lakh crore. It fell to Rs 4.57 lakh crore in 2020-21, thanks to lower tax rates. To compensate for this to some extent, the government has increased the excise duty on petroleum products.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-305

The case relates to a play staged in the school where the script uttered by children allegedly contained derogatory remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The play was allegedly against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). A case of sedition was invoked against the management and organisers of the event. Based on a petition by Nayana Jyoti Jhawar, the division bench of Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice N.S. Sanjay Gowda took note of the photographs which showed the policemen in uniform and with weapons questioning children in March last year.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-305
18-08-2021||India||Union ministry maintains secrecy over India’s Covid vaccine policy||A shroud of secrecy over the closed-door discussions through which health officials and technical experts shaped India’s Covid-19 vaccination policy remains intact. The Central Information Commission, disposing of a set of petitions seeking information on the vaccination policy, has said the Union health ministry has provided all relevant information to citizens. Petitioner Saurav Das, a Right to Information activist and an investigative journalist, had sought from the Union health ministry, among other details, minutes of meetings and file notings of the National Expert Group of Vaccination Administration for Covid-19 and the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, two key bodies that have guided  the vaccination policy. India’s Covid-19 vaccination campaign is currently proceeding at a pace significantly lower than what it needs — less than six million doses administered daily, instead of an ideal around nine million daily — mainly because of limited supplies. Sections of health experts say the current limited supplies are the likely outcome of decisions taken by either NEGVAC or other arms of the government presumably after technical discussions weighing pros and cons of multiple options. Das, whose petitions had sought information on those technical discussions, had appealed to the commission after the health ministry informed him that members of NEGVAC have to sign non-disclosure agreements. The ministry also said other information is exempt under Section 8(1)(a) of the RTI Act as it would prejudicially affect India’s strategic, scientific or economic interests. The ministry also told Das  it has consistently made available information relating to NEGVAC’s decisions and the vaccination policy through the Press Information Bureau, media conferences and minutes of NTAGI meetings are available on its website. The commission in its final adjudication on Monday said it finds the denial of information invoking such exemptions under Section 8(1)(a) without proper justification “untenable,” but said is it “convinced” that the respondent (the health ministry) has provided relevant information. “The respondent ought to and, as facts indicate, has been updating all relevant information which can be of use to citizens and serve the interests of all sections in the society,” the commission said. Das and another RTI activist Venkatesh Nayak, not associated with Das’s petition, said they are disappointed. “Everyone knows the decisions taken — but the minutes of meetings and file notings could have provided insights into the thinking, discussions, debates, if any, leading up to those decisions,” Das said. Nayak said the RTI Act requires the government to provide all relevant information about decisions that impact the public. “The government is obliged to provide information on details of the decision-making process too.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-305

It sent chief minister Nitish Kumar flying to inspect the situation in Khagaria and Bhagalpur districts. At present 16 out of 38 districts including Buxar, Bhojpur, Patna, Saran, Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Begusarai, Khagaria, Darbhanga, Saharsa, Bhagalpur, Munger, Lakhisarai and Katihar are facing the deluge. Bhagalpur and Khagaria are the latest areas to face the floods due to the Ganga that is flowing above the danger level in the state. The river’s strong flow has ruptured embankments, have cut-off various roads and national highways, and is threatening railway bridges. Sixteen people have been killed so far in the floods that have affected 27 lakh people living in around 2200 villages in these districts. Around 88 thousand of them have been displaced from their homes. “During the aerial survey, I saw that a large number of people in Bhagalpur district have been affected by the floods. Increase the number of flood relief centres as required and also ensure that the number of people staying at a centre is limited so that nobody experiences discomfort,” Nitish instructed Bhagalpur district magistrate Subrat Kumar Sen. Talking to media persons after inspecting relief centres, camps and community kitchens, Nitish pointed out that he was touring the flood-affected areas to take a first hand account of the situation. “We keep on issuing guidelines for the affected areas. The state government is providing a financial help of Rs 6000 to every flood-affected family. Food and accommodation is being provided at the relief camps. Special attention is being given to pregnant women staying at such camps,” Nitish said. The chief minister added that the state government was providing an assistance of Rs 10,000 for every boy and Rs 15,000 for every girl born at the flood relief camps. Meanwhile, the railways has cancelled 10 express and two passenger trains, changed the routes of 15 long-distance trains, and decided to terminate and start a couple of other trains from stations other than their pre-scheduled ones on the Jamalpur–Sahebganj and Jamalpur–Bhagalpur sections of the Malda division. “These temporary steps have been taken due to heavy rains and the increasing water level at different railway bridges,” East Central Railway chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar said. The water resources department informed that the left embankment along the Ganga in Gopalpur block in Naugachhia sub-division of Bhagalpur has collapsed due to extreme pressure of water on it. Its officials are taking steps to contain the flow of water that was still spreading all around, inundating villages, roads and agriculture fields. Most of the other major flood-bringing rivers like Kosi, Bagmati, Kamla Balan, Burhi Gandak, Punpun, Adhwara, and Khiroi were flowing below the danger level at several places in the state. The only glimmer of hope was that the level of Ganga was showing a falling trend from Buxar to Patna, reducing the chances of the flood situation further aggravating in these districts. The mighty river will start calming down in the lower reaches from Patna onwards over the next couple of days.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-305
18-08-2021||West Bengal||Netaji's kin seeks DNA test of ashes kept at Japan’s Renkoji temple||Seven decades have passed since Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose went missing on this date in 1945, with many historians suggesting that he might have died in a plane crash, but the recurring demand to bring back his purported remains from a temple in Japan for DNA examination has not been met with thus far. The freedom fighter's grandnephew, Surya Kumar Bose, issued a statement on Tuesday, making a fresh appeal to authorities to facilitate DNA testing of the ashes that have been interred in Renkoji temple, in an attempt to put a lid on the controversies surrounding his "disappearance". Several theories have persisted since Netaji went missing, with some experts having claimed that he did not die in the crash and lived in disguise till death. Bose, who lives in Germany, said, "Almost two decades ago in the course of the Justice Mukherjee Commission of Inquiry (JMCI), a precious opportunity to conduct a DNA test, and to bring the remains of Netaji home to his beloved motherland, was sadly lost. According to the JMCI Report, the Renkoji authorities were not willing to allow a DNA test of the alleged remains." In his statement, he pointed out that the chief priest of Renkoji Temple, Reverend Nichiko Mochizuki, had written to Indian embassy in Tokyo in 2005 insisting that the remains be returned. Bose, an IT consultant, further quoted excerpts from a letter written by Mochizuki, whose father is known to have received the purported remains of Netaji in September 1945, to make his point. According to the excerpt, Mochizuki told the embassy, "I felt that if I accepted the proposal for DNA testing and the remains are eventually returned to India, my father's soul and spirit could finally be at rest. In this way, I agree to offer my co-operation for the testing." The translation of the chief priest's original letter was commissioned by Madhuri Bose, Netaji's grandniece. Renkoji Temple authorities were fully supportive of a DNA test on the remains, Bose maintained. "It is time to seize the opportunity missed by Justice Mukherjee to conduct a DNA testing procedure on the reported remains of Netaji. There is every reason to believe that this entire process would be fully acceptable to and supported by the Renkoji Temple authorities, as well as by the governments of both Japan and India, the IT consultant stated. Bose had in 2015 met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Berlin to raise the demand for declassification of all secret files related to the freedom fighter. "Subhas Bose did not belong just to his family. He had himself said that the whole country is his family," the grandnephew had said back then. Earlier, Netaji's daughter Anita Bose Pfaff had also requested the governments of India and Japan to make arrangements to bring her father's purported remains back home.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-129
18-08-2021||West Bengal||Seven more homes eroded by Hooghly in Santipur||Erosion along a stretch of the Hooghly river bank claimed seven more homes in ward 16 of Nadia’s Santipur on Monday night, with victims demanding their immediate rehabilitation. With this, around 25 hous¬es have been lost to the Hooghly river this past one month in Santipur. Local sources said the latest spate of erosion began around 9pm on Monday. Raimohan Das, a farmer who lost his house, said: “It was so sudden and rapid that we lost everything before real¬ising the possible danger. We felt a tremor and the river gob¬bled up our houses one by one within a span of 10 minutes.” Erosion victims alleged that over the years both the Centre and the state govern¬ment had been making a moc¬kery of their plight as no per¬manent solution had been of¬fered to lakhs living in the ero¬sionprone district. “The state government’s protective measures have pro¬ved useless. We pay taxes to the government, but it has done al¬most nothing, except offering tarpaulin and dry food. It app¬ears the administration consid¬ers us flood victims. We need proper rehabilitation as we have been forced to shift homes several times in the past few years,” Raimohan added. Panicky over the quick erosion, at least 20 families liv¬ing close to the river bank in the Char Saragar and Gobar Char area of ward 16 disman¬tled their houses on Tuesday to shift to safer places. Till Tuesday afternoon, 40 families had taken shelter at a local primary school. On July 18, when five hous¬es and 30 bighas of farmland were lost to erosion, residents had blocked NH12 to protest the lack of protective measur¬es. The administration had th¬en assured them of starting work soon. Nothing has been done, the villagers alleged. A state irrigation official said: “Continuous rain affect¬ed our efforts. We will start taking temporary steps once it stops raining. Major work will be done after monsoon.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-129
18-08-2021||West Bengal||150 BJP workers arrested for violating Covid protocols on first day of Shaheed Samman Yatra||Around 150 BJP workers, including eight MLAs, were arrested across Bengal and Union minister of state Shantanu Thakur was allegedly detained by officers of the Calcutta airport police station for violating Covid protocols on the first day of the party’s Shaheed Samman Yatra on Tuesday. Four MPs from Bengal, recently appointed ministers of state in the Union government, and party workers had gathered at three destinations — Calcutta party headquarters, Gouripur Kalibari Jessore Road and Bagdogra — to lead the Shaheed Samman Yatra held to remember BJP workers allegedly murdered by their Trinamul counterparts between 2018 and 2021. Police stopped them at various places. “It is clear that police are working as servants of Trinamul. If Trinamul can celebrate Khela Hobe Divas on Monday, why aren’t we allowed to do our work while abiding by Covid protocols,” said Bongaon MP Thakur, the Union minister of state for ports, shipping and waterways. While Thakur was allegedly detained, state BJP vice-president Joyprakash Majumdar, five MLAs and others were arrested by airport police from Gouripur on the northern fringes of Calcutta. According to Majumdar, they were kept at the police station for almost three hours. “All of us were arrested. They detained Shantanu (Thakur) illegally because one can’t arrest a Union minister for no reason,” Majumdar said. Thakur wrote a letter to the officer-in-charge of the airport police station alleging he had been detained illegally. Police sources claimed Thakur voluntarily sat inside the police van that took arrested BJP supporters to the police station. Two persons of the BJP’s youth wing were arrested in front of party’s headquarters at 6 Muralidhar Sen Lane in Calcutta. Later, MLAs Anup Saha and Sushanta Ghosh were arrested from the same spot. They were to accompany Bankura MP and Union minister of state for education Subhas Sarkar on his yatra. Twenty-one members, each from BJP’s Barasat and Hooghly organisational districts, were also arrested. Siliguri MLA Shankar Ghosh and 30 BJP supporters were arrested in Siliguri. Around 45 BJP supporters attired like the Narayani Sena troops of erstwhile royals of Cooch Behar were on their way to Bagdogra airport to welcome Nisith Pramanik, the BJP's Cooch Behar MP and Union minister of state for home affairs and sports, when they were arrested from Bihar More there. As the news spread, a large number of BJP supporters came in front of the police station. Its gate collapsed under pressure and injured some cops. Those arrested were later released on personal bonds. Pramanik and John Barla, the Alipurduar MP and the Union minister of state for minority affairs, returned to north Bengal for the first time on Tuesday after becoming ministers, and started the yatra from Bagdogra. BJP’s Nandigram MLA and Bengal’s leader of Opposition, Suvendu Adhikari on Tuesday said his party would move court next week, seeking immediate implementation of the anti-defection law against Mukul Roy. Roy, the former Trinamul de facto number 2, joined BJP in 2017 and became one of its vice-presidents and an MLA, but recently joined his old party. Since then, Adhikari and the BJP have been desperately trying to get the Assembly Speaker to reject Roy’s membership by invoking the anti-defection law.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-129
18-08-2021||West Bengal||Three Bengal ministers removed as heads of boards at civic bodies||Three Bengal ministers were on Tuesday removed from the helm of board of administrators at civic bodies in keeping with the Trinamul Congress’s new policy of “one person, one post”. While Sujit Bose was removed as the head of the board at South Dum Dum, Rathin Ghosh and Arup Roy were divested of the charge at Madhyamgram and Howrah, respectively. The decision prompted speculation on the future of minister and senior Trinamul leader Firhad Hakim, who is at the helm of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s board of administrators. The overall pattern of the changes, said several seniors in Trinamul, has a discernible imprint of the party’s national general-secretary Abhishek Banerjee, whose appointment to the post took place on June 5, the same day the policy was adopted. While the list of members on the board of administrators at the Jalpaiguri municipality was announced on Tuesday, leaders of Trinamul and the BJP were all surprised. Subhajit Kar, who had left Trinamul and joined the BJP in February, was made a member of the board. According to Trinamul insiders, the list of prospective members of the board had been prepared and sent to the state leadership when Kar was still in the party. “It seems the state leadership did not cross-check whether he is still with the party. We think that is why his name is on the list,” a district Trinamul leader said. Kar himself was perplexed. “I have not yet received any formal letter, but yes, I have seen the notification. It is surprising as Trinamul hardly gives recognition to any leader or elected representative of other political parties,” he said. Former minister Rabindranath Ghosh has been nominated as the chairman of the North Bengal Development Council, while Binoy Krishna Burman and Sabitri Mitra, have been made the vice-chairperson. Both Burman and Mitra are former ministers. Former Trinamul district presidents like Ranjan Sarkar and Gautam Das and former MPs like Bijoy Chandra Burman were appointed as members of the council.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-129
18-08-2021||West Bengal||Smugglers across Bengal and northeast border use bartery system for illegal trade||The operatives engaged in smuggling of various items across north Bengal and Northeast, which share borders with Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and China, have begun using barter system to carry on with their illegal trade at a time delivering cash on receipt of consignments has become difficult because of a host of factors. A senior BSF officer posted in Malda district said the force had come to know of the new modus operandi when it had intercepted some drugs consignments and arrested members of a racket that was engaged in sending illegal firearms and cough syrups to Bangladesh. “During interrogation, it emerged that the operatives have switched to a system of bartering these days. This change has indeed made surveillance difficult,” said an officer of a central intelligence agency posted in the district. Between north Bengal and Northeast, the BSF guards around 2,500km of the India-Bangladesh border. As the borders that India shares with Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Bhutan are porous and the areas adjoining the boundaries are densely populated, surveillance has always been a challenge as smugglers invent new ways to hoodwink security agencies. The basket of products that are illegally traded between north Bengal and Northeast with the neighbouring countries has also been expanding and a multi-country network has developed. “Earlier, it was cattle and fake currency which were smuggled along the India-Bangladesh border. But in recent times, the basket has expanded to include items ranging from gold to yaba tablets to cough syrups, firearms and of course, narcotics. The pandemic-induced lockdown, because of which normal border trade has suffered, may have been the reason behind the broadening of the basket and the emergence of the multi-country network,” said a source in the BSF. During conversation with multiple sources in BSF, the SSB and other state and central agencies, it was revealed that the system of barter — an innovation that has taken the agencies by surprise — has resulted in a sudden spurt in illegal trade across multiple borders. Researchers who have studied the new mechanism that the rackets have evolved elaborated on the issue, while underscoring the system is helping the smugglers handle less cash. “For example, a consignment of tablets and cough syrups is sent to Bangladesh. In return, the supplier receives a consignment of narcotics (see map). He is then sending the drugs through his own channels to places like Calcutta, Bihar and even to the neighbouring country of Nepal and in return, obtains some other items which are smuggled out to Bangladesh. This is how this system is functioning. It is not that they are not handling cash, but in lesser quantities,” said Abhijnan Sengupta, a researcher in economics who is based in Malda. He has said while transferring money to banks from anywhere in the world has become easy these days, those involved in illegal trade are aware of the hazards because of strict vigil on transactions. Sending huge amounts of cash through the Hawala channels, the researcher said, has become difficult these days and that’s why the barter system has evolved. “Operatives in multiple countries are involved and hence, the barter system works well as there are no worries about exchanging currencies... Once the product reaches the final recipient, that person can sell it in local currency and realise the gains,” explained Sengupta. As security agencies have learnt about the new method, they have also found that though there are certain limitations in the barter system — for example, ascertainment of prices — the smugglers have even evolved a process to overcome the problem. “There is a specific price for each of the items which they exchange illegally across the border. Messages are exchanged after each consignment is sent and calculations are done on quantities,” said an official of a central intelligence agency.

18-08-2021||West Bengal||Bimal Gurung’s former aide Sanjeev Lama floats hill forum||The formation of an apolitical Hill Youth Forum was announced on Tuesday by a former aide of Bimal Gurung, one in a series of such initiatives in the hills which clearly points out that some in the hills are increasingly losing trust in political parties “to solve the issues of the land”. Sanjeev Lama, who was on the run with Bimal Gurung for more than three-and-a-half-years on Tuesday, said “aware youths” decided to form the apolitical forum to take forward “issues of the land” that are political in nature. “We announce the formation of Hill Youth Forum. People in the hills are confused why problems of the land have not been solved. Political parties have their own agenda,” said Lama. Lama was actively involved with Gurung’s Gorkha Janmukti Morcha but in recent months distanced himself from Gurung. Many believe this is largely because Gurung decided to join hands with Trinamul in October 2020. Gurung decided to support Trinamul in the 2021 Bengal Assembly polls. Lama backed an Independent from Darjeeling. The seat, however, was won by Neeraj Zimba of GNLF who contested on a BJP ticket. “We will take forward our demands constitutionally. We will speak to aware youths and citizens to take forward our demands,” said Lama. The forum’s spokesman, Lochan Gurung, asked: “Why are panchayat elections not being held in hills? Why are various administrative interventions not taking place?” Panchayat elections were last held in the hills in 2000. This is however not the first “apolitical platform” trying to take forward political issues of the hills. Kishore Pradhan, who recently quit the Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists (CPRM), a party currently in alliance with the BJP in Darjeeling, announced “an apolitical platform which will work like a political platform”. Pradhan is supported by former CPRM leader Bindiya Dukpa. After the Gorkhaland agitation in 2017, the highlight of which was the 104-day total shutdown with no concrete returns, another apolitical platform National Gorkhaland Committee is also trying to take up political issues of Darjeeling hills, which include creation of a separate state of Gorkhaland or “permanent political solution.” “It is obvious many in the hills perceive politics to be in complete disarray. This is why many, who can’t immediately float a political party, are trying to create space through these forums,” said an observer. Anit Thapa, who was Binay Tamang’s second-in-command for years, is set to form a political party in early September. Many in the hills say that after the 2017 Gorkhaland agitation, no leader has been able to establish himself where politics is governed by the emotive issue of Gorkhaland. “The decision of Gurung, Tamang and Thapa to join hands with Trinamul (for Assembly polls) did not go well with people if poll results are any yardstick,” said the observer. Even though BJP-GNLF and its allies have won three elections after 2017 they have not been able to assert themselves as the ruling party in the hills as Trinamul allies are still considered more powerful in solving local issues. “There is a complete vacuum in terms of political leadership in the hills now. The BJP-GNLF has been winning elections but they are yet to be seen as parties that rule the roost in the hills,” said an observer.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-129
18-08-2021||West Bengal||Alert on the stranded from Bengal in Afghanistan||The Bengal government has asked all district magistrates to inform Nabanna at the earliest if they receive any information on anyone from the state stranded in Afghanistan. The message was sent to the districts after Nabanna came to know that some persons from the state, particularly from the Darjeeling hills, were stranded in Afghanistan and desperately awaiting evacuation following the country’s takeover by Taliban. “We heard that some people from the state might be stranded in Afghanistan. But we have not received any official complaint from the family members. So, we have asked the district magistrates to play a proactive role to find out if there is anybody stuck in Afghanistan,” said a senior government official. Sources at Nabanna said if the state got any such report officially, the government would request the Centre to evacuate the stranded persons. The state government has told the DMs that in case they receive information of persons stranded in Afghanistan, they should send a report to Nabanna, along with details like phone number, current location and contact person in Bengal. The sources also said Nabanna had become active on the issue after reports came in that some family members in Darjeeling had approached local BJP MP Raju Bista to take initiatives to evacuate their family members in Afghanistan. “It was heard that the MP had already written to Delhi on the developments. It is uncomfortable for the state government that it has no such information yet. This is why the DMs have been asked to play a proactive role,” said a source. Bista, who reached Darjeeling on Tuesday, said a committee headed by a joint secretary in the ministry of external affairs was being formed to oversee the evacuation of Indians stuck in Afghanistan. “I am in constant touch with the MEA and also people from Darjeeling who are stuck in Kabul….Our priority is to ensure the return of every citizen of the country. The MEA has formed a committee and the Prime Minister is also looking into the issue,” said Bista. The Darjeeling MP admitted that there were some problems in the Kabul airport as “Taliban have taken control of some parts of the airport”. “However, we are trying to solve this issue….I request people to be patient and please don’t go by rumours but rely on government information,” said Bista. Senior officials said they would try to find out family members of people stranded in Afghanistan and persuade them to lodge complaints with the authorities. “It should be official between the state and the Centre. The state has to be kept in the loop for the benefit of the stranded people. Some states have already approached the Centre with a list of stranded people in Afghanistan,” said a source.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-129

The CPM area committee, which oversees activities of the party unit to which Ajanta belongs, has recommended her suspension for three months and the final decision will be taken by the Calcutta district committee. “The area committee has sent its recommendation to the district committee. When the district committee meets on Saturday, it will take a final call. However, traditionally, the recommendation of the area committee is never altered by the district committee,” a source in the party said. The article authored by Ajanta, who is an associate professor of history at Rabindra Bharati University in Calcutta, was titled “Woman power in Bengal politics” and chronicled the contributions of the likes of Basanti Devi and Sarojini Naidu. However, in the last part of the series, Ajanta heaped praise on Mamata Banerjee, who came to power in 2011 ending the Left Front’s three-and-a-half decades’ rule. The CPM had showcaused Ajanta and she replied that she had only tried to uphold the contributions made by women in politics without judging any political colour. Clearly, her answer didn’t go down well with the area committee which has finally recommended her suspension to the district committee. In the CPM’s course of things, a member can be suspended for a minimum of a month to a maximum of a year for antiparty activities. If the member continues with such activities even after suspension, those can lead to that person’s dismissal. On Tuesday, calls from this newspaper to Ajanta went unanswered.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-129
18-08-2021||North East||Tripura HC refuses to stay police probe against Abhishek Banerjee, five others||The Tripura High Court on Wednesday refused to put a stay on the investigation against TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and five others for allegedly obstructing police officers from performing their duties, and asked the state government to justify within two weeks why the case should not be quashed. A complaint has been registered in Tripura against Banerjee, MP Dola Sen, West Bengal education minister Bratya Basu, TMC's Tripura leader Subal Bhowmick and two others under section 186 of the IPC for allegedly coming in the way of the police who were carrying out their duties. Senior TMC leader Subal Bhowmick subsequently filed a plea before the court seeking dismissal of the case and a stay on the investigation against the TMC leaders. Justice A A Kureshi, while hearing the case, asked the state government to file a reply in two weeks on why the case should not be dismissed, and asked the police to continue with the investigation. The judge, however, maintained that the police should not submit its final report without consulting the court. Kiran Kumar, the superintendent of police (SP) in Khowai district, had said that a suo moto complaint was filed on August 10 against the TMC leaders, who "misbehaved" with officers on duty two days ago. "We booked them on August 10 under Section 186 (obstruction of public servants in the discharge of his public function) and 36 (common intention) of the IPC. The FIR pertains to entry into the Khowai police station. They will be summoned," the SP had stated. At least 14 leaders and workers of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) were arrested in Khowai district on August 8, including those injured in an alleged attack by BJP men the day before, for "flouting Covid-19 norms". Shortly after, the party's national general secretary, who is also West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's nephew and the de facto number 2 in the party, flew to Agartala from Bengal to meet the apprehended workers in Khowai police station. Those arrested were later produced before a local court, which granted them bail. In a video that went viral on social media, the TMC national general secretary was seen raising his finger to enquire why his supporters were arrested "after having faced assaults". According to the police, the 14 TMC members were nabbed for venturing out after the imposition of night curfew at 7 pm, in violation of the Covid-19 restrictions. Bhowmik, when approached by reporters during the day, said, "We are happy that the high court has admitted the case. Let the police investigate... the truth will come out."||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-9

18-08-2021||North East||Covid: Vaccine cash award of Rs 5 lakh announced by Meghalaya govt||The Meghalaya government has decided to award Rs 5 lakh each to the first 100 villages that get their eligible population vaccinated by August 31. Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma made the announcement in Shillong on Sunday in his Independence Day speech, devoted mostly to the challenges posed by Covid-19 and the government steps to check its spread. “An amount of Rs 5 lakh will be given to every such village (which meets 100 per cent vaccination target) for carrying out development work,” Sangma said as part of the government step to remove vaccine hesitancy. According to Sangma, though cases are on the decline compared to the peak in May, positivity rates continue to be high. Since the onset of Covid-19 last year, Meghalaya has detected over 71,000 positive cases and lost over 1,200 lives, a major worry for the government and the trigger to people vaccinated. “Despite the understanding that Covid-19 vaccination is crucial for protection against severe disease and death, the progress of Covid-19 vaccination in the state is sadly unsatisfactory. As on date only 47% of eligible individuals have taken at least their first dose. There is considerable vaccine hesitancy in the State especially in the rural areas largely due to misinformation,” Sangma said. Along with vaccine hesitancy, Meghalaya is also confronted with refusal for testing and delays in seeking medical attention by infected persons. “Studies and statistics world over as well as practical evidence have indicated that the impact of Covid-19 has not been severe on persons who have been vaccinated. Vaccines give protection from serious illness and death,” Sangma said, hailing the efforts of the frontline workers, police force and civil officials to check Covid-19. Nagaland chief minister N. Rio and his Mizoram counterpart Zoramthanga too dedicated a significant part of their speeches to the impact of Covid and the government and community’s resolve to check the infection. Both of them urged the public to get themselves vaccinated. All the three chief ministers also spoke about finding an amicable solution to their inter-state border disputes with Assam.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-9
18-08-2021||Opinion||Editorial: New disorder||Kabul has fallen. The reverberations of this development in Afghanistan are being felt in global capitals, including New Delhi. India’s challenges in that strife-torn nation are manifold. An immediate priority would be the safe return of its citizens. New Delhi must also ensure that it does its best not to leave behind Afghan citizens, especially those with links with India, who are willing to relocate. India has conducted massive repatriation exercises in the past — the Vande Bharat mission, which facilitated the return of Indian nationals stranded in different corners of the world on account of pandemic-induced restrictions, is a recent example. Curiously, the Narendra Modi government has been tight-lipped about its rescue template in Afghanistan. The Centre’s silence, hopefully, is not a sign that it does not have a plan in place. The long-term obstacle, obviously, pertains to national security. The political ascendancy of the Taliban — history bears witness — has coincided with disturbances on India’s northern and western borders. The Taliban’s patron, Pakistan, is ever-willing to fish in troubled borders too. With China breathing down India’s neck in Ladakh, New Delhi needs to urgently re-examine its options to pre-empt a crisis on the security front. There is room for diplomacy in this. India is not only a non-permanent member of the United Nations security council but also chairs the Taliban Sanctions Committee in it. These accesses can be used as handy leverages to keep international scrutiny firmly focused on Afghanistan and its neighbour. Additionally, the furtive attempts to establish a rapport with the Taliban leadership must be energized. This is because Afghanistan remains a prime theatre of the unfolding New Great Game and India cannot afford to be content with a back seat. There are strategic compulsions as well: New Delhi is keen to establish communication links in order to reach other countries through Afghan territory. Even though India has been among the nations to declare that they would not recognize a change in regime in Afghanistan by the use of force, it should persist with its outreach to the new overlords. The Taliban, keen to seek international legitimacy, may not be unwilling to respond.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-49
18-08-2021||Opinion||Letters to the editor: Taliban takes control of Afghanistan||Moment of crisis Sir — The Taliban have taken control of Afghanistan, nearly 20 years after being ousted by a military coalition led by the United States of America. This development in Afghanistan poses a grave threat to the world. The Taliban are infamous for denying education to women, carrying out public executions  of their opponents, persecuting minorities and for having destroyed the priceless ancient giant statues of the Buddha. The rash decision of the US president, Joe Biden, to withdraw all forces from Afghanistan has led to a humanitarian catastrophe in the country. A new Taliban regime will be a disaster — it has a history of executions, torturing women, and shutting down schools. The group is likely to support other extremists — there is no guarantee that Afghanistan would not once again become a safe haven for outfits such as the al-Qaida and the Islamic State. As in the past, they may try to cause harm to foreign countries. In fact, the Taliban in Afghanistan could also strengthen the militant groups in Pakistan, which are causing trouble in the country. But it is impossible for Pakistan to support the Taliban and maintain good relations with Washington. China has promised big investments in different projects in Afghanistan. According to reports, it is ready to formally recognize the Taliban. The Taliban rule in Afghanistan could jeopardize India’s peace and security as well, especially if it supports insurgent groups in regions as volatile as Kashmir. Venu G.S.,Kollam, Kerala Sir — With the fall of Kabul and the flight of the outgoing president, Ashraf Ghani, the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan seems to be almost complete. The Afghan forces could not resist the advances of the Taliban; they crumbled like a house of cards. In fact, it has been reported that many Afghan soldiers readily handed over their weapons to the Taliban and joined their ranks. The United Nations has urged the Taliban ‘to show restraint to protect lives’. The Afghan special forces may now find it hard to fight back. The withdrawal of the American troops has clearly hastened the Taliban’s return to power. This has drawn parallels with US troops getting out of Vietnam. The Taliban claim that their return to power was made possible by the ‘uprising’ of the people. The visuals of human figures clambering up the ladder and clinging on to the sides of a plane standing on the tarmac at the Kabul airport, the crowds running alongside a US military plane as well as reports of five persons being killed by gunfire at the airport are reflective of the chaos marking the transition of power in the country. While laying out their future plans, the Taliban have promised ‘serenity’ and to build an ‘inclusive Afghan Islamic government’. But only their conduct will show if they have changed and become less rigid — the Taliban have not explicitly stated that girls and women would not be discriminated against and denied education or jobs. They have not made it clear how they plan to treat ethnic minorities either. By securing stability in the region and becoming less stringent in imposing religious laws, they can change their perception of being an entity with a hard-line attitude and become more acceptable. G. David Milton,Maruthancode, Tamil Nadu Sir — Having taken over the reins of power, the Taliban juggernaut is finally trampling on Afghanistan. This onslaught has put the US in an embarrassing position, given that its intelligence agencies had predicted the siege of Kabul in 90 days. A Taliban spokesperson recently spoke of the outfit’s appreciation of India’s involvement in the development of Afghanistan. India must tread carefully. K. Nehru Patnaik,Visakhapatnam  Step up Sir — As always, Indian athletes who won medals at the Tokyo Olympics were heaped with praise. But few paid attention to ones who got close to a podium finish but failed — for instance, the golfer, Aditi Ashok, missed the bronze, as did the wrestler, Deepak Punia. It is, therefore, heartening that Tata Motors has decided to felicitate such promising sportspersons by gifting them one of its premium cars. It would be further helpful if such major companies also stepped up to sponsor the training of athletes in need of support. This might help the country clinch more medals next time.

18-08-2021||Opinion||Editorial: Unseemly rant||The captains of Indian industry were horrified last week by the intemperate outburst against the Tatas and several other reputed business houses by the Union commerce minister, Piyush Goyal. He accused them of pursuing grubby corporate motives in a manner that undermined national interest. The diatribe was apparently triggered after the Tatas strenuously opposed Mr Goyal’s plan to amend e-commerce laws that seek to clamp onerous restrictions on digital marketplaces. The Narendra Modi government has already spooked industry by ordering an intense scrutiny of the relationship between online marketplace operators like Amazon and Walmart and their partners that sell their products through these digital channels. This has snowballed into an anti-trust investigation into their business practices. The Tatas fear that the proposed e-commerce laws will circumscribe their ambitions in the online retailing arena. The boffins at Bombay House, the headquarters of the $106 billion conglomerate, have been beavering away on a ‘Super App’ through which the Tatas plan to sell a wide range of products manufactured by group companies, business associates and their joint ventures. The row is over restrictions that could potentially block the sale through the Super App of multi-brand products currently peddled by BigBasket in which the Tatas recently acquired a 64 per cent stake. The worrying aspect in the controversy is the Centre’s attempts to push a woolly self-reliance agenda under the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ initiative and re-define the notion of national interest. The sordid attempts to blend narrow, executive-inspired policy objectives with harsh regulatory directives raise barriers to business and make a mockery of the government’s self-gratulatory assertions that it is trying to create a level playing field. There is concern that the government’s interference in matters that should be decided by market forces is another sinister attempt to influence outcomes and cherry-pick winners. The industry has retreated into a sullen, dignified silence after Mr Goyal’s tongue-lashing. The fear of retribution has muzzled protest. Opposition politicians have been the only ones to express outrage at the outburst. It is high time that India Inc learnt to work up the courage to publicly voice its views on vital issues that impact its business. The Centre has been grappling with the task of framing new rules for the digital economy. A draft national policy framework paper had projected the size of the digital economy in India at $1 trillion by 2022 which will swell to almost half the size of the overall economy by 2030. There is a lot to play for here. Mr Goyal’s rant is a sign of the edginess within the government as it tries to balance conflicting, often competing, interests in an emerging battlefield.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-49
18-08-2021||Opinion||Lessons in new ways to lead||On August 1, India assumed the presidency of the United Nations security council for the month and promptly got to work on setting the agenda with a focus on three major areas: maritime security, peacekeeping and counter-terrorism. India began its eighth two-year term as a non-permanent member of the UNSC on January 1; this is its first presidency during its 2021-2022 tenure. New Delhi clearly wants to leave a significant imprint of its presidency, as was underlined by the Union external affairs minister, S. Jaishankar, when he said that India will always be “a voice of moderation, an advocate of dialogue and a proponent of international law”. Narendra Modi became the first Indian prime minister to preside over a meeting of the UNSC last week when he chaired the open debate on ‘Enhancing Maritime Security: A case for international cooperation’ via video conference. This reflected a new desire on the part of New Delhi to lead from the front on global governance issues. The message that went out was one of the commitment of India’s top political leadership to sustain and support the nation’s foreign policy ambitions. It was way back in 1992 that the then Indian prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, had attended a meeting of the UNSC. New Delhi seems determined to make the most of its two-year tenure in the UNSC. This was reflected in the comments of the foreign secretary, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, in the run-up to India’s presidency: “We will leave our mark on the Council and our point is to say that India really, by its contribution, establishes the right to be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.” The open debate gave India an important opportunity to highlight its role in bringing the international community together on a topic that is important not only for global stability but also for Indian interests. Under Modi’s chairmanship, the UNSC adopted the first-ever outcome document on maritime security which emphasized the importance of safeguarding the legitimate uses of the oceans while affirming the need to embed it in international law as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Modi outlined five principles to develop a “framework of mutual understanding and cooperation” on maritime security which included free maritime trade, a joint fight against maritime threats from natural disasters and non-State actors, the preservation of the maritime environment, the promotion of responsible maritime connectivity and the peaceful settlement of maritime disputes in accordance with international laws. This was a push towards a more holistic and comprehensive approach to maritime security away from the piecemeal approach of the past. As the centre of gravity of global politics and economics shifts to the Indo-Pacific region, there is no denying the critical role of maritime security; the ability of nations, big and small, to harness its full potential remains a function of wider stability and peace in the maritime order. India’s growing role as a critical, nodal actor in the Indo-Pacific region makes it imperative to push this agenda on the global stage, in spite of the challenges from nations like China. India’s UNSC membership gives it that diplomatic heft, which New Delhi has done well to exploit. The UNSC meeting was attended by several heads of state and senior UNSC members, including the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the secretary of state of the United States of America, Antony Blinken. The latter highlighted India’s leading role in maritime issues in the Indo-Pacific and thanked New Delhi for its “leadership in bringing us together today and calling on all nations to recommit to defending and strengthening the maritime rules and principles that we forged together and [are] committed to uphold”. Putin, on the other hand, recommended the creation of a maritime security body in the UNSC to address maritime crimes, piracy and maritime terrorism even as he reassured the international community that Moscow would continue to work towards ensuring security in the Persian Gulf and the Atlantic Ocean. India also ensured that the language of the presidential statement was acceptable to all members without losing the essence of New Delhi’s priorities. In the past, the UNSC has engaged with selective aspects of maritime security, but India has pushed for a comprehensive approach. Chinese actions in the maritime domain were clearly an important target for New Delhi as Modi called for peaceful resolution of maritime disputes on the basis of international law and emphasized the need to encourage responsible maritime connectivity. India has moved away from the idealism of the past in its engagement with the global multilateral order. New Delhi has become more pragmatic in seeking outcomes in its favour, as is reflected in the way it has taken up key issues as its priority during its UNSC presidency. As a nation that seeks to emerge as a ‘leading power’, a more effective use of multilateral organizations like the UN to shape the global governance agenda should be a priority for New Delhi.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-49
18-08-2021||Opinion||Leading prophet||In his book on Zoroastrian scripture, Rohinton Nariman writes evocatively about Spenta Mainyu, the holy spirit that shows man the path to truth. As judge of the Supreme Court of India, Justice Nariman exemplified an abundance of that spirit. True to the revelations in the Gathas, holy verses for Zoroastrians, Justice Nariman sought to emulate the spirit through “deeds done for the love of truth”, speaking “words of the highest wisdom”. If the Supreme Court were a court of religion, Justice Nariman would be one of its leading contemporary prophets. Like most prophets, Justice Nariman’s foremost contribution was to advance human understanding. He did this masterfully by laying down new laws in several areas. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was in serious danger of being stillborn with challenges to its constitutionality being brought almost contemporaneously with its enactment. Justice Nariman deftly rescued the Code from these birth pangs and made it the centrepiece of India’s new financial regulation regime. His concurring opinion in the right to privacy case laid down a fundamental proposition — that individuals have privacy over their bodies and their minds to do and think as they please. In taxation matters, his assessee-friendly judgments have given succour to taxpayers, large and small. He leaves the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court in a better state than in which he found it. His shining moment in court came quite early, in a case when the power of policemen to arrest citizens for sending messages on social media that they deemed “menacing” or “grossly offensive” was challenged for violating the freedom of speech. Justice Nariman, together with Justice J. Chelameswar, struck down the infamous Section 66A of the Information Technology Act that gave policemen this power. The fact that posts critical of governments can even be published on social media today is a legacy of this judgment. Even though its effects seem to be fraying as several police forces are contemptuously going ahead and registering cases under this unconstitutional section, they are still on the wrong side of the law. As long as the rule of law means something in India, the judgment in the Shreya Singhal case will remain a lodestar of freedom. Freedom, particularly for the oppressed, was a theme Justice Nariman often returned to during his judicial tenure. Its most politically significant expression was in the Triple Talaq case where his judgment ensured that no Muslim man would be able to say talaq thrice and divorce his wife. It was a terrific strike for gender equality, yet it expressed a certain dogmatism. It refused to view the issue as one of gender discrimination, choosing instead the more arcane legal principle that triple talaq was manifestly arbitrary. Like many religious prophets of yore, women’s empowerment did not appear to matter to him for its intrinsic value. In laying down a new principle that parliamentary legislation could be struck down as ‘manifestly arbitrary’, Justice Nariman broke new ground. It is a well-established principle that judges cannot question the wisdom of Parliament — if legislators feel the best way to deal with drug addicts is by putting them in prison, judges cannot question that choice, no matter how senseless it might be. Without such a principle, the rule of law could simply be replaced by a rule of judges who could do as they thought best. If that were the case, there wouldn’t be any need for an elaborate Constitution with carefully delineated rules. Merely stating something was manifestly arbitrary would be enough. But so certain was Justice Nariman about his conviction that manifestly arbitrary legislations emanating from Parliament should have no place in modern, progressive India that a well-defined precedent was overturned to achieve this result. This came from a deeper, more prophetic, belief that courts, and not elected legislators, could get things done more effectively for the greater good of the country. His presence on the benches of the Supreme Court that fast-tracked the finalization of the National Register of Citizens in Assam is a direct consequence of this belief. Again, when threats to the independence of the judiciary, real or feigned, were claimed in the aftermath of sexual harassment allegations against the then Chief Justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi, Justice Nariman along with his brother judges agreed to institute an internal inquiry into allegations of a conspiracy to defame the judiciary. With the inquiry proving inconclusive, in hindsight, this appears like a smoke and mirrors exercise in which Justice Nariman willy-nilly participated. His time-tested belief in the unchecked ability of courts to do justice brooked little introspection. This is why when the former CJI, R.M. Lodha, offered him judgeship of the Supreme Court of India in 2014, Nariman, following the time-bound conventions of the court, accepted it. This was despite his flourishing legal practice and in full knowledge that in the ordinary course he would not have an opportunity to become the CJI. Gopal Subramanium, another leading member of the Bar, also accepted the then CJI’s offer at the same time, only for it to be rejected by the government. In his final years on the bench, Justice Nariman would have the opportunity to revisit this opaque system of appointments where two similarly placed senior members of the Bar could face completely different fates in the appointment lottery. If prophets are society’s greatest reformers, this was Justice Nariman’s opportunity to rise to the occasion. For close to two years now, the Supreme Court has not had a single new judge. Some have put this down to Justice Nariman’s insistence on merit above all other considerations in appointment. Others have pointed to internal politics of the collegium, especially judges only picking their favourites. That the facts themselves are unclear and no criteria for judging merit exists mean that the opaque system of appointment continues. A convention-bound Nariman remained a silently conscientious objector; but a reformer he was not. Perhaps post-retirement, freed from the constraints of his office, Nariman will be more vocal. After all, the judicial ‘Garo deman’ (abode of song, or heaven, in the Gathas) cannot be an overly silent place. It needs its prophets to speak clearly and wisely. What legacy then does Justice Nariman leave behind? On his retirement, different people have answered this question differently. The senior advocate, Indira Jaising, believes that he will be remembered for his “commitment to liberty”. Advocate Gautam Bhatia, focusing on his role in the NRC orders, considers them on a par with “spirals of exclusion, violence, detention camps, and death” for which “we continue to pay the cost in human suffering”. Both are right in their own way. After all, one’s assessment of a judge’s legacy is shaped by whether one likes the results reached in particular cases. But it would be a disservice to Justice Nariman to see him this way, whether in praise or rebuke. Both Spenta Mainyu, and its twin, Angra Mainyu (the evil spirit), are part of the larger omnipotent force of creation in the Gathas. Both exist in each of us and the Gathas urge us to strive to choose good over evil. In every action in his judicial career, Justice Nariman remained steadfastly true to this dictum. With the Supreme Court at a critical juncture in its history, this is his abiding legacy. Arghya Sengupta is Research Director, Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy.

18-08-2021||Jharkhand||Jamshedpur FC plan early arrival in Goa for training ||The Jamshedpur FC contingent will assemble in Goa, the venue for the Indian Super League season of 2021-22, for pre-seasons early this year. Unlike last season when the contingent arrived in batches to Goa in October, plans are afoot to assemble by the end of September. The tournament kicks-off on November 19. The Indian players had a nearly month-long pre-season last time but some among the foreign recruits, including goal machine Nerijus Valskis, had little time to slip into the training groove. "Head coach Owen Coyle wants 5-6 week pre-seasons. So, we have plans to assemble in Goa by the end of next month or, at the most, by October first week. We can start our pre-seasons in the first week of October if we reach Goa by September-end since the players (and support staff) will be required to go into quarantine for 8 days. It will be good if we reach Goa early this time," a team management member said on condition of anonymity. According to him, the quarantine schedule would depend on the anticipated third wave of the pandemic. The team management member said Valskis could get just four days of pre-seasons last time. "In fact, he (Valskis) did his fitness drills for three days and a day for training before he played a match. Some other foreigners like Aitor Monroy, Alex Lima and Nicholas Fitzgerald also had short training time," he recalled. Jamshedpur FC will soon start intimating the players on when to reach Goa. The club had arranged its pre-seasons in Thailand in the 2017-18 season and Spain was the destination in the following season. However, JFC conducted its pre-seasons in Jamshedpur for the 2019-20 calendar. The Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Fatorda, the Tilak Nagar Stadium in Vasco da Gama and the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim are the three venues slated to host the matches with strict training and social distancing protocols. The Men of Steel stood sixth with 27 points (20 matches, seven wins, as many loses and six draws) in last season’s ISL held in Goa. The Tata Steel-owned club has not made it to the play-offs since making debut in the cash-rich ISL in 2017-18. Most of the players are in place and the club is keen to train hard with adequate time in disposal. The club is serious about qualifying for the play-offs and beyond.. "We are doing the required things to qualify this time," the team management member said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-69
18-08-2021||Jharkhand||Tata Steel launches country's first scrap recycling plant ||Tata Steel on Wednesday commissioned its new first of its kind 0.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) steel recycling plant at Rohtak in Haryana. The plant has been set up in collaboration with Aarti Green Tech Ltd., as a ‘Build, Own, Operate’ (BOO) basis. Officials said it is the first such facility in India, equipped with modern and mechanised equipment like shredder, baler and material handler. The scrap would be procured from various market segments such as obsolete vehicles, household and construction materials through an App FerroHaat. The scrap would then be processed through mechanised equipment and the high-quality processed scrap would be supplied for downstream steel making. Steel produced through the recycled route entails lower carbon emissions, resource consumption and energy utilisation. The steel major on Wednesday also launched two new brands - Tata FerroBaled and Tata FerroShred for the baled and shredded ferrous scrap produced in its new facility. These products are high quality processed scrap and they promise to provide the much-needed raw material fillip to Indian steel industry by making available quality processed ferrous scrap and reducing the dependency on imports. Both Tata FerroBaled and Tata FerroShred will ensure high cleanliness, low contamination, high bulk density, lower tramp elements and no radioactivity. The products would be accompanied with test certificates, another first for the scrap industry, along with value propositions like higher yield, better productivity, lower conversion costs, lower transportation  and overall a better quality. Yogesh Bedi, chief Steel Recycling Business, Tata Steel, said, “Steel can be recycled again and again without losing its properties. From that perspective steel scrap is a valuable resource and an important future raw material for steel making.  The brand names will give a distinct identity to the processed scrap and ensure a standardised quality product for the customer and simultaneously raise the bar of the scrap Industry. This initiative was the vision of our CEO and managing director T V Narendran."||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-69

A group of 45 students took admission in the BE course launched in 2014 at IIT (ISM) especially tailored for the Afghan students as part of the government of India’s effort to help rebuild the war ravaged, mountainous landlocked country. Besides conducting the special course for Afghan students, IIT (ISM) also organised a fortnight-long training for 180 mining officials of Afghanistan since April 2013 in 12 batches of 15 officials each for helping the war ravaged country to establish a school of mines in Kabul in line with Indian School of Mines. Talking to The Telegraph Online from his native place and workplace at Indore, Malkhan Singh, a 2017 batch B. Tech Civil Engineering said, “My room was surrounded with all rooms allotted to Afghanistan students of BE course so I had the greater opportunity among others of my batch to interact with them.” “I was always interested in foreign affairs, diplomatic policies, strategic affairs and international relations since my school days so I was very curious to learn about lifestyle, culture, food habits, history of Afghan students ever since they came to our hostel in January 2014,” said Malkhan and added that though only a few of them knew Hindi but during the course of time of more than two years all of them started speaking Hindi fluently. “We used to enjoy food, and many a times I used to visit their canteen as the mutton and chicken used to be quite delicious,” said Malkhan who is presently engaged in organic farming in Indore after completing his B Tech from IIT (ISM) and is simultaneously preparing for civil services exam as he was never interested in government jobs. “They were very fond of Indian movies and many of them were fans of Bollywood superstars like, Akshay Kumar, Salman Khan, Shahrukh Khan etc and we watched a lot of movies both inside the campus and also outside in theatres,” said Malkhan. “Being a fitness freak I used to also accompany them in ISM gymnasium as many of them being physically strong always spent time for workouts at gym,” said Malkhan. “Several of these students, like Farhad Yousefe, remained in touch with me till a few days ago and we are eager to know about them again in the present situation,” said Malkhan. Himanshu Mishra, B.Tech (Civil Engineering) 2018 pass out of IIT (ISM) presently settled in Patna said, “The experience with Afghan students during our stay at Amber Hostel was quite exciting and they were familiar with us like any other Indian student.” Professor of Chemistry at IIT (ISM) G. Udayabhanu who served as the course coordinator for the six month foundation course conducted from January 2014 to July 2014 ahead of beginning for formal session of BE course for Afghan students said, “Our foundation course for Afghan students was like preparatory course and they were taught, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and English and all the students were quite cooperative and humble with teachers.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-70
18-08-2021||Jharkhand||Coal town hospital witnesses an increase in attacks on women||A 40-year-old female patient from Giridih admitted in Patliputra Medical College and Hospital, faced an unusual situation on Tuesday night when a youth of Telipara locality, Aman Kumar Sao, posed nude before her and made sexual overtures. The incident took place 36 days after a mentally challenged woman patient was raped at the hospital by an ambulance driver on July 12. The incident however exposed the failure of the police and district administration’s efforts to heighten security in the hospital, which caters to the  health care needs of people of  several adjoining districts besides Dhanbad, including, Giridih, Jamtara, Godda, Sahebganj, Pakur, Chatra, Koderma etc despite the repeated incidents of violence or attack against women. A high level team of district administration and police led by, Kumar Tarachand, additional district magistrate (law and order), which visited the hospital after the incident of rape carried out security assessment and submitted a report to Deputy Commissioner Sandeep Kumar recommending establishment of a police outpost in the hospital. The team during the security assessment of July 13 also objected over the mushrooming of a large number of eateries and stalls inside the hospital and recommended plugging all unauthorised entries through the boundary wall of the hospital. Several of these recommendations, including the establishment of a police outpost inside the hospital however, are yet to be followed as the site selection of the police outpost is yet to be completed. The latest incident took place at around 11 pm near the toilet where the women were washing the utensils in the wash basin. Aman Kumar Sao who arrived at the hospital to check up on a patient of his locality and came out of the toilet to wash his hand at the wash basin shouted at the woman when she was leaving for her ward, pointing towards a saucer left by the woman at the wash basin. As she approached towards the wash basin to take back the saucer, Aman exposed himself after which the woman started shouting and other patients and attendants rushed to the site and later handed him to the police. Kishor Tirkey, Officer in Charge of Saraidhela police station said, “We have arrested the main accused and lodged a case against him under section 354 of IPC, related to criminal force against the women with the aim of outraging her modesty.” When asked about the repeated incidents of attack against women patients in hospital, Tirkey said,“We had initiated the process of establishing the police outpost inside the hospital and also some sites were suggested by hospital administration inside the hospital but we want a site near the gate so that it is visible to people and patients can approach the police at any time.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-70
18-08-2021||Jharkhand||Dhanbad to conduct Covid tests at schools||The Dhanbad health department under the leadership of Civil Surgeon, Shyamkishore Kant has decided to carry out Covid tests at schools across the district amidst the increasing concern about the vulnerability of children during the third wave of the pandemic. Kishore, during a meeting with health officials at his office on Tuesday, instructed them to hold a meeting with the school authorities across the district and launch the swab testing of teachers and other staff of the school on a priority basis. Talking to The Telegraph Online Kant said, “We have already forwarded a letter to the District Education Officer, Prabala Khes in this regard to cooperate with the health department personnel for ensuring the proper testing of the teachers and staff as soon as possible.” “However, we have also made preparations to hold meetings with the school authorities on our own as soon as possible to ensure launching the testing process in schools by next week,” added Kant. Divulging more details, Kant said, “The focus of the drive would be on vaccination also as we will instruct the school authorities that no staff of the school interacting with the students remain unvaccinated and their swab testing will also be conducted.” “Though, we will not conduct the swab testing of students in schools at large as this will lead to panic among the students and may lead to decrease in students attendance but their thermal scanning and symptom analysis would be conducted by health workers and if anyone is found with influenza like symptoms then only his swab testing would be carried out,” he said. “We at the same time are also planning to increase the Covid testing at different places of the district including the traffic check posts of the district besides the regular testing conducted at the bus depot of Dhanbad and at Dhanbad Railway station as part of the comprehensive plan to increase the testing process across the district,” said Kant. “We will send letter to Om Prakash Yadav, District Transport Officer in day or two to ensure the stoppage of Buses at the Bus depot campus at Bartand campus itself to ensure the covid testing of all passengers as we have received complaints of buses stopping outside the Bus Depot to skip the testing process of passengers,” he said. When asked whether there is any sign of increase in Covid graph in the district, he said that any perceptible increase in Covid testing can be ascertained only if the graph remains high even after increased testing of more than 4000 tests per day.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-70
18-08-2021||Jharkhand||Jharkhand plans to develop parks and playgrounds across state ||The Jharkhand government has decided to create more playgrounds and open spaces across towns and cities of the state with the urban development asking all 40 urban local bodies (ULB), including Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC), to begin work immediately to identify exisiting spaces or create new ones. Amit Kumar, director of the State Urban Development Agency (SUDA), an arm of the state urban development department, said the move was based on directives of chief minister Hemant Soren who was keen to promote sports at the grassroots. “One of the biggest problems for city dwellers today is lack of proper space for exercise, jogging or simply to sit and relax. For kids, the culture of highrise apartments has led to shrinking of play areas. All municipal bodies have been asked to send proposals within a week," Kumar said. Sources said the urban development department planned to use funds from the 15th finance commission for the playground project. “We have asked all municipal bodies to send us at least three proposals. The idea is that at every city/town there must be at least one dedicated playground to begin with,” said an official. To indicate the government's seriousness about the plan, the official referred to Hemant's initiative of August when he launched the revamp of Jaipal Singh Stadium at Kutchery in Ranchi promising funds to the tune of Rs 4.5 crore. Residents welcomed the move. Sunny Singh, an under-18 volleyball player, spoke of how players like him had to struggle for a place to practise owing to encroachments near, and poor upkeep of, the Jaipal Singh stadium. “Even the condition of Morabadi ground isn’t good. It’s a welcome sign if the government is now focusing on developing playgrounds," he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-70
18-08-2021||Jharkhand||Covid patients dodging mandatory institutional quarantine in Ranchi||Many Covid patients, mostly those who are asymptomatic, have been dodging mandatory institutional quarantine in Ranchi and posing a risk of transmission among local residents and family members, officials said on Wednesday, adding that the district administration has directed incident commanders to ensure that Covid patients aren't allowed to stay at home. “We cannot afford to be complacent at this stage. All area commanders have been directed to make sure that Covid patients in their areas are sent to institutional quarantine and not allowed to stay at home irrespective of the severity of their symptoms,” said Ranchi deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan. As per government data, the count of active Covid-19 cases has shot up from 50 to over 100 in Ranchi in the past week or so. However, only about 15 patients were admitted in hospitals, a source from the district administration said. According to latest data with the health department, there were 103 Covid patients in Ranchi on Wednesday and only  two of them were undergoing treatment at Sadar Hospital. Also, Jharkhand’s largest government-run hospital, the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), had zero bed occupancy in the Covid ward on Tuesday – an indication that Covid patients were avoiding hospitalisation. “We do not have any Covid patients admitted in our hospital today. While this can be seen as a positive sign that patients are not developing serious symptoms, we also need to be aware of the fact that patients could be avoiding hospitalization,” Dr. Prabhat Kumar, the coordinator of Covid-19 task force at RIMS, said on Wednesday. Dr. Kumar added that strict adherence to the mandate of institutional quarantine was needed in order to avoid a rise in cases of infection. The government, he said, should not allow home quarantine for Covid patients even if the number of cases come down to zero in the district. In July, the health and family welfare department in Jharkhand had done away with the option of home isolation for Covid patients and made institutional quarantine mandatory even for asymptomatic patients. While the cases dropped significantly in early August, the trajectory of Covid cases has seen an upward trend in the past one week, forcing the government to plan reopening of quarantine centres. The Ranchi district administration is planning to reopen the quarantine centre at the Mega Sports Complex in Hotwar in order to accommodate Covid patients in case of a sudden spike in cases, officials said. As per government data, there were 217 active cases of Covid-19 in Jharkhand by Wednesday morning and about 40 per cent of the patients were symptomatic. Almost half of the active cases in Jharkhand were from Ranchi, the district which has reported the highest number of Covid cases and fatalities in the state so far.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-70
