In its 231-page order, which comes nearly four years after ordering a detailed probe, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has also directed the companies, association and individuals to "cease and desist" from anti-competitive practices in the future.  The final order has been passed against United Breweries Ltd (UBL), SABMiller India Ltd, now renamed as Anheuser Busch InBev India Ltd (AB InBev), and Carlsberg India Private Ltd (CIPL), among other entities.  The regulator did not impose any fine on Ab InBev, while lesser penalties have been slapped on others.  UBL and Carlsberg India, which are major players in the beer market, said they were reviewing the order.  An official release said the companies and other entities have been found to be "indulging in cartelisation in the sale and supply of beer in various States and Union Territories in India, including through the platform of All India Brewers' Association (AIBA)".  As AIBA was found to be actively involved in facilitating such cartelisation, CCI has also held it to be contravening the competition law.  "Giving benefit of reduction in penalty... 100 per cent to AB InBev and its individuals, 40 per cent to UBL and its individuals and 20 per cent to CIPL and its individuals," the release said.  The fines on UBL and Carlsberg India are nearly Rs 752 crore and Rs 121 crore, respectively. A fine of over Rs 6.25 lakh has been imposed on AIBA and various individuals have also been fined by the regulator.  The period of cartelisation was considered to be from 2009 to at least October 10, 2018, with CIPL joining in from 2012 and AIBA serving as a platform for facilitating such cartelisation since 2013. All three beer companies were lesser penalty applicants before the regulator.  As per the release, October 10, 2018, was the date on which the Director General (DG) conducted search and seizure operations at the premises of the beer companies.  Based on evidences of regular communications between the parties collected by the DG during search and seizure, and disclosures made in the lesser penalty applications, CCI found that the three companies engaged in price coordination, which is in violation of competition norms, the release said.  In a statement, a UBL spokesperson said it was examining the order and "will decide on further course of action".  A Carlsberg India spokesperson said in a statement it was reviewing the order with their lawyers and have no further comments at this point.  CCI, which keeps a tab on unfair business practices across sectors, ordered a detailed probe by its investigation arm DG in October 2017.  The matter was taken up suo motu by the regulator following a filing of an application under Section 46 of the Competition Act by Crown Beers India Pvt Ltd and SABMiller India Ltd, both ultimately held by Ab InBev, against UBL, Carlsberg India and AIBA in July 2017.  Section 46 pertains to lesser penalty provision.  The companies were found to have engaged in price coordination in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, West Bengal, National Capital Territory of Delhi and Union Territory of Puducherry.  Besides, they were found "collectively restricting the supply of beer in the states of Maharashtra, Odisha and West Bengal... and in sharing of the market in the state of Maharashtra as well as coordination with respect to the supply of beer to premium institutions in the city of Bengaluru," the release said.  Further, the fair trade regulator also found coordination among UBL and AB InBev for the purchase of second-hand bottles.  Also, "4 individuals of UBL, 4 individuals of AB InBev, 6 individuals of CIPL and the Director General of AIBA, were held by CCI to be liable for the anti-competitive conduct of their respective companies/ association," the release said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-60

The benchmark index was at 1,000 points back on July 25, 1990 and took nearly 25 years before it touched the 30,000 level on March 4, 2015. The Sensex has climbed from the 30,000 level to 60,000 in a little over six years, reflecting the overall bullishness in the market. "Sensex reaching 60,000 today is an indicator of India's growth potential, as well as the way India is emerging as a world leader during COVID period in addition to worldwide monetary expansion and relaxed fiscal policies adopted by world powers," said Ashishkumar Chauhan, MD and CEO, BSE.

In the coming month, the news flow on the corporate earnings would also help the market to rally further, he added. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Seoul and Hong Kong ended with losses, while Tokyo was positive. Equities in Europe were also trading on a negative note in mid-session deals.

The outperformance of India during September so far is stunning with MSCI World Index down 2.13 per cent and Nifty up by 4.03 per cent, he said, adding that the poor performance of the Shanghai Composite due to regulatory crackdown and the China Plus One policy have again made India an attractive investment destination for FIIs.

The rating agency had downgraded India’s sovereign rating to Baa3 (the lowest investment grade) from Baa2 with a negative outlook in June last year. It had cited a weak reform push contributing to a prolonged period of slow growth amid the Covid-19 pandemic, pointing out that the outbreak amplified vulnerabilities in India’s credit profile that were already present and building prior to the shock. The officials of the rating agency are slated to meet North Block officials next Tuesday, sources said. The officials are expected to point out the economic measures taken by the government and steps being taken to meet the budget target. Moody’s had last month projected India’s growth at 9.6 per cent for the 2021 calendar year and 7 per cent for 2022, unchanged from its May 2021 forecast, citing the picking up of economic activity along with the gradual easing of Covid-19 restrictions. The rating agency said it expects further upside to growth as economies around the world progressively reopen.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-60

This follows Dish TV postponing the annual general meeting that was scheduled on September 27. No new dates have been communicated yet. According to Yes Bank, the extension is based on “unfounded reasons” and Dish TV is engaging in “dilatory tactics” in placing the resolutions to remove its managing director Jawahar Goel along with four other directors. The Essel group’s direct-to-home service provider had sought more time as any change in the CEO or the board of directors of the company needs the approval of the ministry of information and broadcasting. Dish TV on Thursday said it has received a communication from Yes Bank to call for an EGM. “In the light of the company engaging in dilatory tactics in placing the resolutions before the shareholders, the bank is constrained to issue the present notice under Section 100 of the Companies Act, 2013 for holding an EGM of the Company,” Yes Bank said. “The bank has issued revised notices to the company on September 9, 2021, wherein the effectiveness of the change in directorship of the company was made subject to receipt of the ministry approval,” it said. It had in its letter dated September 18, 2021 submitted details of the proposed directors to enable the company to apply to the ministry and seek their approval, Yes Bank said. Yes Bank holds 47.19 crore shares of Dish TV, representing a 25.63 per cent stake.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-60
24-09-2021||Business||Competition Commission of India sued by Google over probe leak||Alphabet Inc’s Google on Thursday said it was suing the Competition Commission of India (CCI) following the leak of a confidential CCI report into an antitrust investigation of the US tech giant. According to media reports, a CCI investigation had found Google abused the dominant position of its Android operating system in India, using its “huge financial muscle” to illegally hurt competitors. Google said last week it looked forward to working with the CCI to “demonstrate how Android has led to more competition and innovation, not less.” In Thursday’s statement the company said it had filed a legal challenge against the CCI at the Delhi high court “to prevent any further unlawful disclosures of confidential findings”. Google said it was “protesting against the breach of confidence which impairs Google’s ability to defend itself and harms Google and its partners”. “We are deeply concerned that the Director General’s Report, which contains our confidential information in an ongoing case, was leaked to the media while in the CCI's custody...Protecting confidential information is fundamental to any governmental investigation,” a Google spokesperson said in the statement. “We cooperated fully and maintained confidentiality throughout the investigative process, and we hope and expect the same level of confidentiality from the institutions we engage with,” the  statement added. The company stated that the DG’s findings “do not reflect the final decision of the CCI” and the submission of the investigation report is an interim procedural step. “Google has not yet had the opportunity to review the DG’s findings, much less submit its defence of any allegations,” the statement said. The CCI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the legal action. A Google spokesman declined to comment on whether it had sought cease and desist orders on further media coverage of the contents of the CCI report. India’s antitrust authority ordered a probe in 2019, saying Google appeared to have leveraged its dominance to reduce device makers’ ability to opt for alternative versions of its mobile operating system and force them to pre-install Google apps. Its 750-page report subsequently found the mandatory pre-installation of apps “amounts to imposition of unfair condition on the device manufacturers” in violation of India’s competition law. The report, which has been seen by Reuters but which is not public, also found the company leveraged the position of its Play Store app store to protect its dominance.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-60

GST rates on yarn in the category of man-made fibre at 12 per cent are higher than garments at 5 per cent if the item costs below Rs 1,000, leading to refund of input tax credit generating a revenue outflow. The GST Council has been deliberating on correcting the anomaly in textiles and had announced a three-month waiting period till December at its meeting in Lucknow last week before making the change. The changes will, therefore, take effect from January 2022. “If they bring everything to 12 per cent to correct the inverted duty structure, the common man would have to pay 7 per cent extra. That will lead to a one-shot increase of 7 per cent in prices,” said Sanjay Jain, chairperson of the textile expert committee of the Indian Chamber of Commerce. Jain said garment prices have already shot up 20 per cent in the last one year because of the increase in the prices of cotton and other fibres. A further increase in  rates may severely impact small garment manufacturers. “The solution is to maintain a status quo and let the current duty structure continue and to refund the excess taxes. The other solution is to reduce duty on man-made fibre yarn to 5 per cent. That is ideal but may lead to some revenue loss,” said Jain. The industry is also concerned about a rise in unaccounted activities if tax rates go up. “The moment the duty on garments below Rs 1,000 a piece increases from 5 per cent to 12 per cent, it would be detrimental to the industry. Unaccounted business will grow in a big way,” said Vinod Gupta, co-chairman, textiles sub-committee, Bharat Chamber of Commerce, and senior vice-president, West Bengal Hosiery Association. Working capital The industry also expects a rise in working capital requirement especially for the MSME textile manufacturers if the rates are increased. “If the GST rate is increased to 12 per cent, cost for  consumers will go up. If the rates increase, our working capital requirement will go up immediately,” said Ramesh Agarwal, past president, Merchants Chamber of Commerce and Industry.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-61

Market watchers said they expected the 30-share Sensex to cross the 60000 milestone on Friday itself. The BSE bellwether had scaled 59000 last Thursday and is now at 59885 in just seven sessions, only 115 points short of another milestone in this searing bull run. However, there are concerns that stocks may be in the expensive zone and are ripe for a correction. But the bulls are in no mood to let go of the reins as they filled their shopping carts with stocks that have benefited from the recent reform measures even as they took heart from the lower number of Covid cases that have spurred hopes of a quick turnaround in the economy. The BSE Sensex on Friday opened in the green at 59358.18 and scaled a new peak of 59957.25 during the day — just 42.75 points shy of the 60000 mark. It finally settled 958.03 points, or 1.63 per cent, higher at an all-time high of 59885.36. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty soared 276.30 points, or 1.57 per cent, higher to its new closing peak of 17822.95, while hitting an intra-day high of 17843.90. Investors appeared to give short shrift to the US Federal Reserve’s decision to reduce its monthly bond purchases of $80 billion from November. The Fed also signalled  it may raise interest rates sooner than expected as inflation is expected to average 4.2 per cent in the final quarter of 2021 before falling to 2.2 per cent in 2022. The US central bank has the mandate to maintain an inflation of 2 per cent. Moreover, indices in Shanghai and Hong Kong ended with gains while the bourses in Europe were trading on a positive note in mid-session deals. Investors reacted to the  positive news from debt-ridden Chinese developer Evergrande as the People’s Bank of China injected $18.6 billion into the banking system. Evergrande had said that it has “resolved’’ interest payment on one of its bonds. However, it remains to be seen if it is successful in repaying some of its other bond repayments. “The bulls showed no signs of weakness to soar higher boosted by strong global cues and broad-based buying led by realty, metal and banking stocks,’’ said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services. “Global markets tempered optimism despite a slightly hawkish tilt by the Fed intimating that the US central bank will begin reducing its asset purchases in November and conclude the tapering process around mid-2022.” “However, investors continue to remain on the edge awaiting clarity on the Chinese economy. The domestic realty sector continued its rally,”  he said. Bajaj Finserv led the gainers list among the Sensex stocks as it rose 5.15 per cent. It was followed by Larsen & Toubro, HDFC, Axis Bank, SBI, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank and ICICI Bank which gained up to 3.46 per cent. Heavyweight Reliance Industries was also in action as its shares ended with gains of 2.43 per cent at Rs 2,489.65. However, there are a few experts who are advising caution. “Amateurish money of retail investors is now dominating over the smart money of institutional investors. This may change when FIIs turn into major sellers. We don’t know now when and what might trigger that. Taking some money off the table may not be a bad idea even while riding this bull,’’ said V.K. Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-61

The remarks by exterior affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had been a response to the Chinese overseas ministry’s assertion earlier within the day that the Galwan Valley incident was the results of Indian forces illegally trespassing on the LAC to “encroach on Chinese territory”. The brutal conflict in Galwan Valley on June 15 final year, which noticed troops from each side combating one another for a number of hours with rods, golf equipment lined with barbed wire and rocks, resulted within the first fatalities on the LAC in 45 years. The Indian aspect misplaced 20 troopers whereas China has acknowledged 4 deaths. The testy alternate on Friday mirrored the tensions attributable to the dragging army standoff on the LAC that started in May 2020. The two sides withdrew frontline troops from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February and from Gogra in August. India has insisted bilateral ties will be normalised solely when disengagement and de-escalation is accomplished at different friction factors on the LAC reminiscent of Hot Springs and Depsang. Responding to a query on the reorganisation of the Indian army into theatre instructions and its impression on the Sino-India border on the Chinese overseas ministry’s common information briefing, spokesperson Zhao Lijian stated: “The Galwan Valley incident last year was caused by the Indian side’s illegal trespass of the LAC to encroach on Chinese territory, in violation of previously signed treaties and agreements.” Zhao added, “We hope that the Indian side will strictly abide by relevant treaties and agreements signed by the two countries and take concrete actions to safeguard peace and stability in the China-India border areas.” The collection of treaties and agreements signed by the 2 sides over time on sustaining peace and tranquillity alongside the LAC had “played an important role in upholding stability along the China-India border”, he stated. The exterior affairs ministry spokesperson dismissed Zhao’s remarks that the Galwan Valley incident occurred as a result of India violated all treaties and agreements and encroached on Chinese territory. Bagchi stated: “We reject such statements. Our position with regard to developments last year along the LAC in eastern Ladakh has been clear and consistent. It was the provocative behaviour and unilateral attempts of the Chinese side to alter status quo in contravention of all our bilateral agreements that resulted in serious disturbance of peace and tranquillity.” He added, “This has also impacted the bilateral relations. As emphasized by [external affairs minister S Jaishankar] in his meeting with Chinese [foreign minister Wang Yi] earlier this month, it is our expectation that the Chinese side will work towards early resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols.” Following a gathering between Jaishankar and Wang on the margins of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Dushanbe on September 17, the Indian aspect had stated each ministers had agreed on additional conferences of army and diplomatic officers to speedily resolve the remaining points associated to the standoff. Several rounds of diplomatic and army talks have failed to finish the tensions, the worst in a long time. India has constantly rejected China’s accusations that Indian troops crossed the LAC in japanese Ladakh, and asserted that New Delhi has all the time taken a accountable method to frame administration and sustaining peace and tranquillity. Meanwhile, Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong stated in a digital deal with to a observe II dialogue occasion on Friday that “peace and tranquillity in the border areas is important, but it is not the whole story of the bilateral relations”. His remarks mirrored the Chinese place that the standoff be delinked from ties in different areas reminiscent of commerce. Addressing the occasion co-hosted by the School of International Studies of Sichuan University (SCU), China Center for South Asian Studies and the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, Sun stated the difficulties witnessed in bilateral ties since 2020 had been “unseen for many years”. The two international locations ought to search a “fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution” to the LAC standoff via dialogue, he stated. “We hope that the Indian side will meet us halfway to move the situation towards stability and shift it from urgent dispute settlement to regular management and control, so as to jointly safeguard the peace and tranquillity of the border area,” he added. Sun contended it is crucial for India and China to cooperate to counter turbulence and alter on the worldwide stage, the Covid-19 pandemic, sluggish financial restoration and the sudden adjustments in Afghanistan. “The current status of bilateral relations [is] obviously not in the fundamental interest of either side. Many far-sighted people from both countries have advocated that China and India should improve their relations, and bring…relations back on track,” he stated.

He also said in today’s time, no one can “glorify” terrorists.

The 'Coordination Committee of all District Courts Bar Associations in Delhi' called for suspension of work on Saturday and said it will decide the further course of action in a meeting that has been called for Monday. In a meeting held virtually after the incident on Friday afternoon, the committee also proposed that a common policy related to the security was needed in all the district courts. Jailed gangster Jitendra Gogi was shot dead inside a packed Rohini courtroom here by two assailants dressed as lawyers who were also killed in a police counter-fire, officials said. Delhi Bar Association President Sanjeev Nasiar termed the incident as unfortunate and said the police was negligent in its duty. A senior level investigation is required to look into the incident. This raises a question mark on the security. How could someone, lawyer or litigant, take a gun not just inside the premises but inside a courtroom, he questioned. He said in view of the call given by co-ordination committee, the working in all the district courts will be suspended due to revision of security norms on account of the today's incident in Rohini Court, Delhi. Chairman of Bar Council of Delhi, Rakesh Sehrawat sought action against those responsible for security at the Rohini district courts premises and said nothing can be more shameful than what happened today. The bar body has urged the police to take action against those responsible for the security in the court premises there. We are meeting the commissioner or police tomorrow and will raise our concerns. Nobody, including the judges and the lawyers, is safe, he said. If the steps are not taken to safeguard those inside the court premises, the committee will extend the strike further, he said. He said such incidents have been repeatedly happening not just in the Rohini but also in Karkardooma courts premises and that the court security was at stake. Despite raising this issue to Delhi Police Commissioner in multiple occasions in the recent past, no concrete step has been taken. It is due to the security personnel's carelessness that such incidents have been recurring, he said. He also urged the lawyers to cooperate with the security checking. He also said there was requirement of a separate gate for entry and exits for the lawyers. Rohini District Courts Bar Association Secretary Manjit Mathur said that in a meeting held with the judges and the representatives of Delhi Police in Rohini courts after the incident, the body raised the demand of devising a 'common police' related to the security. There should be a common police. Only improving the security after such an incident takes place will not do any good. We have assured to assist the police and want them to do their part, he said. He added that the bar body has demanded a 'high level enquiry' in the matter.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-178
24-09-2021||India||Odisha set to face heavy rainfall as depression forms over Bay of Bengal||Odisha, which was reeling under rain fury last week, is expected to receive more showers owing to the formation of a low-pressure area over Bay of Bengal that may further intensify into depression. The Met office has warned of heavy to very heavy rain in the coastal state over the next four days. "Under the influence of the cyclonic circulation, a low-pressure area has formed over Bay of Bengal and (its) neighbourhood," the Bhubaneswar Meteorological Centre said in a bulletin. The system is now a well-marked low pressure area over east-central and adjoining northeast Bay of Bengal, the centre said. "It is likely to concentrate into depression during (the) next 12 hrs & move west-northwestwards towards Odisha coast during (the) next 48 hrs," the Met Centre tweeted. The Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) issued an advisory asking all collectors to closely monitor the districts where a yellow-weather warning of heavy to very heavy rain has been issued. Officials have been asked to remain prepared to tackle any localised flood-like situation or possibility of landslides in hilly areas, while also ensuring that the control room stays operational round the clock. The weatherman has forecast heavy rainfall at one or two places in Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Cuttack, Khordha, Puri and Jagatsinghpur districts on Saturday. On Sunday, heavy to very heavy rain is likely to occur in Puri, Khordha, Ganjam, Gajapati, Kandhamal. There is a likelihood of heavy to very heavy showers in Nabarangpur, Nuapada, Bolangir, Kalahandi, Koraput and Malkangiri districts on Monday and Tuesday. Fisherfolk have been advised not to venture into the deep sea and return to the coast by Saturday. Squally weather with wind speed reaching 40-50 kmph and gusting up to 60 kmph are expected along and off the Odisha coast during the period. Parts of Odisha had experienced flood after a deep depression-induced rainfall lashed the state earlier this month, leaving at least nine people dead and causing widespread destruction.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-179

Singh, a senior BJP leader, unveiled a statue of Adityanath's religious guru Avaidyanath in Maharajganj in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. He said Adityanath is walking on the path shown to him by his religious guru. Describing Adityanath as a personality who can play multiple roles, Singh said he is working for strengthening both 'sanatan dharma' and the state. Underlining that there should be proper law and order to ensure development, Singh said, "Criminals start shivering on hearing Yogi's name and their hearts start beating fast." "No one can doubt Adityanath's honesty, even if they are sleeping," he said. Uttar Pradesh goes to assembly polls early next year. Singh also hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his strong leadership and said after consulting him, he has given instructions to armed forces personnel not to initiate any attack but to give befitting reply to any instigation from other countries. Singh also recalled his student days at Gorakhpur University and said he had long association with Gorakhnath peeth head Avaidyanath. Speaking at the event, CM Adityanath hailed Singh and said that working along with Prime Minister Modi, he has strengthened the security of the country.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-179
24-09-2021||India||Doctors scale hostile Himalayan terrain in mission to vaccinate all||To visit the Indian village of Malana deep in the Himalayas, a COVID-19 vaccination team scrambled over a landslide that blocked the road the day before, scaled a retaining wall and then began a three-hour trek down and up a river valley. Despite the hostile terrain, the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, where Malana is located, earlier this month became the first in India to administer at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose in all its adults. The steep topography was one challenge overcome by health workers walking for hours or days to reach remote villages and another was religious beliefs, as the tourism-dependent state immunised its roughly 5 million adults. On Sept. 14, a team of five led by district health officer Dr Atul Gupta set out to Malana to administer second vaccine doses. Blocked by the landslide, they left their vehicle with two blue vaccine boxes slung over their shoulders to manoeuvre over the rubble, climb the wall and then walk to the trailhead leading to the village, accompanied by a Reuters photographer. Before beginning the trek to the village, Gupta and his team placed the boxes onto a gondola connected to pulleys to carry the medicine across the river gorge that separates Malana from the road. That lightened their walk considerably as they set off to cross the gorge which drops down about 100 metres (330 feet). During a rest break on the trek, Gupta said that to convince Malana's 1,100 adults to take their first shots in August, its district chief had priests invoke a local Hindu deity. This helped health workers cover up to 700 people in three days, he said. When Gupta's team reached the village on Sept. 14, nearly three dozen people, who took their first shots before the invocation, lined up to get their second shots just opposite an ancient temple to the deity. "People were initially scared to take the vaccine, worried they would fall sick or die," said village head Rajuram, who gave just one name, sitting by the carved wood and concrete walls of the temple. "Then I took it and others also mustered the courage." Himachal Pradesh's Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur pins the state's vaccination success to its village-to-village drive, its decision to involve local-level politicians, and the federal government's push to prioritise immunisations in tourist hotspots. India wants to vaccinate nearly all of its adults by December, having administered at least one dose to two-thirds of people and two doses in less than a quarter. Thakur wants Himachal Pradesh to be the fastest state to reach the two-dose milestone, hopefully by November.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-179
24-09-2021||India||Elgar Parishad case: Varavara Rao's bail plea hearing adjourned||The Bombay High Court on Friday adjourned till October 13 the hearing on a bail extension plea filed by poet-activist Varavara Rao, an accused in the Elgar Parishad case, and said he need not surrender before Taloja jail authorities till October 14. Rao (82) was granted interim bail for six months on medical grounds by the HC on February 22 this year, and was scheduled to surrender and return to judicial custody on September 5. However, Rao filed an application, through his lawyers R Sathyanarayanan and senior counsel Anand Grover, seeking extension of such bail, as well as permission to stay in his hometown, Hyderabad. while out on bail. On Friday. a bench of Justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar adjourned the hearing on his plea due to paucity of time, and said Rao needn't surrender until October 14 after the NIA said it was willing to extend till that date its interim statement that no coercive action will be taken against Rao. The NIA, in an affidavit filed earlier this month, opposed Rao's plea saying the 82-year-old's medical reports do not indicate that he suffers from any serious medical ailment, which made it necessary for him to take treatment at Hyderabad, neither did it form a ground for further extension of bail. The NIA affidavit said Taloja prison had adequate health care facilities, and Rao can be provided with the"best medical facilities" there. At the time of being granted bail, Rao was undergoing treatment at Nanavati Hospital here for multiple ailments. As part of the stringent conditions imposed while being given interim bail by HC, Rao has been staying with his wife in a rented accommodation in the city. In his plea seeking extension of medical bail and modification of bail conditions, Rao has said that, as per the doctors at Nanavati hospital, he is suspected to have a neurological issue known as cluster headache that needs further examination. Rao has further said in the plea that he continues to suffer from multiple ailments, including urinary tract infection with recurrent hyponatremia, suspicion of Parkinsons' disease, lacunar infarcts in six major lobes of the brain, and some eye problems. He said in his plea that if he returned to custody in the Taloja prison, which was not equipped to cater to his medical problems, his health would certainly deteriorate and he might die. Rao, who sought that his medical bail be extended for another six months, in his plea said he found living in Mumbai and accessing health facilities in the city unaffordable and had urged HC to let him stay in Hyderabad while out in bail.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-179
24-09-2021||India||BJP slams Opposition over caste census, says it believes in 'sabka saath'||A day after the Modi government in an affidavit in the Supreme Court virtually ruled out caste census, the BJP on Friday took a swipe at parties advocating it and asked how much representation have they given to different social groups in their organisations and among elected representatives. The ruling party made it clear that its stand on the politically fraught issue can be different from those, including some of its allies, supporting the step. Several parties, mostly regional ones which draw their core support from some of the Other Backward Classes, are pitching for a caste census. At a press conference, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi criticised parties such as the Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Bahujan Samaj Party, all of whom have called for caste census, alleging their leaders were projected as leaders of the poor and deprived communities but they ended up promoting their own families. Asked about the government's stand on the issue, he said it has taken a position on "technical grounds". Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav used to be called "dharti putra" (son of the soil) but he ended up promoting his son. Mayawati, addressed as "behan" (sister) by her admirers, spoke of the deprived communities but groomed her brother," Trivedi. He also slammed the RJD for its alleged family rule and corruption. "As far as the BJP is concerned, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's policy is clear. It is "sab ka saath, sabka vikas" (with everyone, development of all)," Trivedi said and cited the government's welfare measures like direct benefit transfer and supply of free grains and cooking gas cylinder to the poor irrespective of the beneficiaries' caste and community. "We stand for respecting all, giving space to everyone and progress of all. It is visible in the expansion of the (Union) council of ministers and also in our party's functioning," he said. Asked about some of BJP's allies, including Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U) and Union minister Anupriya Patel's Apna Dal, also demanding a caste count of the population, he said different parties are free to take an independent stand. He noted that many BJP allies had a different stand on the issue of Ram temple while his party strongly worked for it. "On that issue (Ram temple) we and our allies had a different stand. They can have a different stand on this issue (caste census)," the BJP spokesperson said. The Centre had told the Supreme Court on Thursday that caste census of backward classes is "administratively difficult and cumbersome" and excluding such information from the purview of Census is a "conscious policy decision." The Centre's stand assumes significance as recently, an all-party delegation from Bihar, which was led by Nitish Kumar, had met the prime minister demanding caste census. In an affidavit filed in the apex court, the government has said that caste enumeration in Socio-Economic and Caste Census 2011 was fraught with mistakes and inaccuracies.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-179

A bench comprising Justices K Vinod Chandran and Ziyad Rahman A A, while imposing the maximum sentence on the accused Madhu, a Manjeri resident, said when a man abandons his wife and children, roving vultures wait to prey on not only the abandoned woman, but also the helpless children. The court's observation came on an appeal filed by the accused who was convicted for raping a minor girl. "When a man abandons his wife and children, roving vultures wait to prey on not only the abandoned woman, but also the helpless children. In this case we have a 'poojari'/ 'komaram' (priest/ oracle in a temple) taking the abandoned woman and the three children under his wing, only to repeatedly molest the elder girl child, that too in the presence of her siblings. We wonder which God would accept the obeisance and offerings of such a priest or make him a medium?" the court noted in its judgement. The high court was hearing the appeal against the POCSO court order. "However, the offence of rape having been proved, the accused is liable to be convicted under Section 376(1). Considering the special relationship the accused had with the victim and the status of a guardian, we are of the opinion that the maximum sentence of life imprisonment would have to be imposed on the appellant," the court said. According to the prosecution, a mother with signs of acute mental illness and her three children were found wandering and were rescued by the police on March 1, 2013. Upon interrogation, the elder child revealed that the person with whom her mother was staying with had been sexually molesting her for over a year. The court noted that the accused, a priest in a temple, usually came home drunk and used to assault the mother and the children and sexually molest the elder child in front of her siblings. "The mental state of the mother, a shame on society, is quite understandable from the stress of having been abandoned, with three children and no means of food or shelter; for which alone the children were subjected to physical, mental and sexual torture. No mother can remain sane in the said circumstances," the court said. The court held that medical evidence proved that the child was subjected to sexual assault. The high court also noted that the brother of the victim, who was the witness in the case corroborated the statements of the child.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-179

In video footage of the shootout involving the two attackers, who were from the rival gang, gunshots could be heard and policemen and lawyers seen in a scramble. Witnesses said a woman lawyer has also received a bullet injury in her leg. Police said the incident happened around 1.15 pm when Gogi was brought to the courtroom number 207 for a hearing, and the two gangsters posing as lawyers opened fire at him. Advocate Sunil Tomar, who was present in the courtroom for his client's bail matters, said there were 15-17 people in the court of judge Gagandeep Singh when the incident happened. "As Gogi entered the courtroom, two persons, who were dressed as lawyers, whipped out their pistols and suddenly opened fire upon him. After hearing gunshots, people started running to save their lives inside the courtroom and the judge also went back to his office just behind the courtroom," Tomar told PTI. He claimed the assailants pumped around 10 bullets into Gogi. "For the first 15 minutes, I could not figure out what was happening there." Advocate Manoj Kumar Nigam, who was also there, said a woman lawyer also received a bullet injury on her leg. A senior police officer said that Gogi was also accompanied by members of the counterintelligence unit of the Delhi Police's Special Cell. "When Gogi entered the courtroom, the two assailants in lawyers' uniform took out their pistols and opened fire on Gogi. Immediately, the personnel from the counterintelligence team which was accompanying Gogi retaliated and the two assailants died on the spot," he said. Joint commissioner of police (northern range) has been asked to enquire into the incident and submit a report. Some lawyers claimed this is not the first such shootout incident at the Rohini court. "I was stepping out of the court when the incident happened. I heard firing and later more rounds were fired...this (incident of firing) has happened for the fourth or fifth time at Rohini. So, the situation has not improved so far," said advocate Rajiv Agnihotri. Jitender Maan alias Gogi, who carried a reward of Rs 6.5 lakh on his head, was arrested along with his three accomplices from Gurgaon by a team of Special Cell in March last year, according to police. He was arrested along with Kuldeep Naan alias Fajja, Kapil alias Gaurav and Rohit alias Koi. The Special Cell was on the lookout for Gogi, Fajja and Gaurav for a long time before tracing them to their hideout in Gurgaon. A few months ago, Fajja had managed to escape from the police custody when he was being produced in the Karkardooma court, another senior police official said. Since that incident, the counterintelligence team of the Special Cell used to accompany Gogi and his associates to court for hearings, he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-179

Under the agreement, Airbus will deliver the first 16 aircraft in 'fly-away' condition from its final assembly line in Seville, Spain. The subsequent 40 aircraft will be manufactured and assembled by Tata Advanced Systems (TASL) in India as part of an industrial partnership between the two companies. The chairman of Tata Trusts, Ratan Tata, congratulated Airbus Defence, Tata Advanced Systems Limited and the Defence Ministry on the inking of the contract, saying it is a "great step" forward in the opening up of the aviation and avionics projects in India. In a signed statement posted on Twitter, he said the project will create a domestic supply chain capability to international standards, which has never been undertaken before. "The C-295 is a multi-role aircraft with several configurations to meet mission requirements. It envisages total manufacturing of the aircraft in India," he said. "The Tata Group congratulates Airbus and the Indian Defence Ministry for this bold step in fully building this state-of-the-art multi-role aircraft in India in support of the Make-in-India thrust to bolster the country's equity framework," Tata said. The contract was signed two weeks after it was cleared by the prime minister-led Cabinet Committee on Security. Airbus said the first 16 aircraft will be delivered over four years after the contract implementation and that all the planes will be equipped with an indigenous Electronic Warfare Suite (EWS). "This contract will support the further development of India's aerospace ecosystem, bringing investment and 15,000 skilled direct jobs and 10,000 indirect positions over the coming 10 years," said Michael Schoellhorn, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space. "The C295 has proven again as the segment leader, and with the addition of India as a new operator, the type will enlarge its footprint even more, not only on the operational aspects but on its own industrial and technological development," he said. Sukaran Singh, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Tata Advanced Systems Limited, described the sealing of the deal as a moment of pride for Tatas and a "milestone" for the Indian military manufacturing ecosystem. "For the first time, an Indian private company will be wholly manufacturing an aircraft in India. This endeavour demonstrates Tata Advanced Systems' capabilities as a defence manufacturer to build globally competitive complex platforms in India," he said. In a statement, Airbus said 'Make in India' is at the heart of its strategy in India, with the company constantly increasing the country's contribution to its global product portfolio. It said the C295 programme will see Airbus bring its complete bouquet of world-class aircraft manufacturing and servicing to India in collaboration with its industrial partners, including the Tatas and leading defence public sector units such as Bharat Electronics Ltd and Bharat Dynamics Ltd. With a proven capability of operating from short or unprepared airstrips, the C295 is used for tactical transport of up to 71 troops or 50 paratroopers, and for logistic operations to locations that are not accessible to current heavier aircraft, it said. The aircraft can airdrop paratroops and loads, and also be used for casualty or medical evacuation. The aircraft is capable of performing special missions as well as disaster response and maritime patrol duties. "The IAF becomes the 35th C295 operator worldwide, with the programme reaching 278 aircraft, 200 of which are already in operation and have booked more than half a million flight-hours," Airbus said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-179
24-09-2021||India||TMC leaders' visit to Goa triggers buzz ||A few senior leaders of the Trinamool Congress (TMC), including MP Derek O'Brien, have arrived in Goa, which has sparked speculation that the Mamata Banerjee-led party plans to make a foray into the BJP-ruled state's electoral politics by contesting next year's Assembly polls. O'Brien, accompanied by his party colleague Prasun Banerjee, landed at the Dabolim airport on Thursday afternoon, from where they travelled to Panaji. When reporters asked O'Brien about the purpose of their visit to the coastal state, he declined to comment. Sources in Goa's political circles claimed that the TMC was in touch with a few Congress leaders and an Indpendent MLA in Goa, and eyeing to join hands with them for the Assembly polls due in February next year. The name of Congress MLA and former Goa chief minister Luizinho Faleiro is being discussed as one of the probables who might join the TMC. However, he has dismissed such reports. "No one has contacted me. If I take any step, I would do it only after consulting my workers," he told PTI. Talking to reporters on Thursday, former Congress MLA Agnelo Fernandes claimed that there has been a lot of resentment within the Congress, which might have triggered rumours about the party leaders switching sides to the TMC. Fernandes said that the Congress, despite emerging as the single largest party after winning 17 seats in the last state elections, was not allowed to form the government by the party's senior leaders. "Some leaders have been facing insult and humiliation in the party," he alleged. However, he refused to confirm whether there was a possibility of any Congress leader joining the TMC. In the 2017 Goa Assembly polls, the Congress had won the highest 17 seats in the 40-member House, restricting the BJP to 13. But surprising the Congress, the saffron party allied with regional parties and came to power under the leadership of senior leader Manohar Parrikar, now deceased. In the West Bengal Assembly polls held earlier this year, the Trinamool Congress bagged 213 of the 292 seats and secured a third straight term in office.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-180

The petition is allowed. The petitioner has been granted bail, said Justice Mukta Gupta. Singh, who was remanded to judicial custody on August 10 after his arrest, is accused of creating enmity between different groups and inciting the youth to propagate against a particular religion at a rally at Jantar Mantar here on August 8. In his plea filed through advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain, Singh claimed that he was not involved in giving any inflammatory speech or raising any slogan against any person or community. He asserted that the demand of establishing a Hindu nation did not attract Section 153A (hate speech) of the IPC and that he was not even present at the site at the time of sloganeering. The Delhi Police had opposed Singh's plea for his release on bail. On August 27, Additional Sessions Judge Anil Antil had refused bail to Singh, arrested by the Delhi Police in the case, saying right to assemble and freedom to air one's thoughts are cherished under the Constitution. However, these are not absolute and have to be exercised with inherent reasonable restrictions.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-180

There was a sense of interest in the Prime Minister's vision of 'One world, One sun and One grid''. In his meeting with Lall, Chief Executive of General Atomics, the discussions centred around India's recent drone policy, including the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. Drone is an upcoming sector in India and it is of particular interest to the youth. Interacted with Mr Vivek Lall of General Atomics Global Corporation and spoke about how India is ushering a paradigm shift in drones policy, seen in our PLI scheme and reform measures, Modi tweeted after the meeting. During his meeting with Stephen Schwarzman, the CEO of Blackstone Group, investment opportunities in India, including those arising due to the National Infrastructure Pipeline and National Monetisation Pipeline were discussed. The Blackstone Group has a very large presence in India and is a very significant investor in India. He (Schwarzman) referred to India as the number one performing country in the world, said the foreign secretary. His commercial success and intellectual prowess are admirable. We talked about India's investment potential and why our country is one of the world's most attractive destinations for investment, Modi said in a tweet after the meeting with the Blackstone CEO. In a statement, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said he appreciates Modi's commitment to growing India's technology sector and creating a business-friendly environment. "We discussed the importance of semiconductors and the need for a reliable and geographically diverse supply chain," he said. I also expressed Qualcomm's continued support for India's transition to 5G and a digitally empowered society, as well as its semiconductor supply chain initiatives. 5G represents a substantial opportunity for India and we look forward to working with the government, India's technology-forward startup community and local industry to make it a reality, Amon said.

24-09-2021||India||We are natural allies, says Modi at meeting with Kamala Harris ||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has described India and America as "natural partners" as he held the first in-person meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House during which they decided to further cement the Indo-US strategic partnership and discussed global issues of common interest, including threats to democracy, Afghanistan and the Indo-Pacific. "India and America are natural partners. We have similar values, similar geopolitical interests," Modi said in a joint media appearance with Harris on Thursday, the first-ever person of Indian origin to be elected as the vice-president of the United States. Noting that India and the US are the largest and oldest democracies, Modi said the two countries share values and their coordination and cooperation is also gradually increasing. Both the leaders appreciated that the bilateral relationship is on a sound footing, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla told reporters here while giving details of the meeting that lasted for an hour. This is the first meeting between the two leaders. Harris had earlier spoken with Modi over the phone in June during the COVID-19 crisis in India. "You are the source of inspiration for so many people across the world. I am completely confident that our bilateral relationship will touch new heights under President Biden and your leadership," Modi told Harris. Later in a tweet, Modi said, "Glad to have met @VP@KamalaHarris. Her feat has inspired the entire world. We talked about multiple subjects that will further cement the India-USA friendship, which is based on shared values and cultural linkages." The two leaders were wearing masks as they both spoke in front of a battery of  reporters from both India and the US. Modi invited the 56-year-old Democratic leader and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff to visit India. "Both President Biden and you assumed office at a time when our planet faced very tough challenges. In a short time you have had many achievements to your credit be it COVID-19, climate change or the Quad," Modi said. In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs said the two leaders exchanged views on recent global developments, including in Afghanistan and reaffirmed their commitment towards a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region. The two leaders discussed the COVID-19 situation in their countries, including ongoing efforts to contain the pandemic through expedited vaccination efforts, and ensuring supply of critical medicines, therapeutics and healthcare equipment, it said. "As relates to the Indo-Pacific, the US stresses on maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific, Harris said, amidst China's aggressive moves in the strategically vital region. India, the US and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China's rising military manoeuvring in the region. China claims nearly all of the disputed South China Sea, though Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam all claim parts of it. Beijing has built artificial islands and military installations in the South China Sea. Harris said the world is more interconnected and more interdependent than ever before. And the challenges that we face today have highlighted that fact. COVID-19, climate crisis and the importance of our shared belief in the Indo-Pacific region, she said. Both sides acknowledged the importance of collaborative action on climate change. Prime Minister spoke about India's push for increasing renewable energy and the recently launched National Hydrogen Mission. He also emphasized the importance of lifestyle changes to promote environmental sustainability, the statement said. Modi noted that he had the opportunity to speak to Harris after she assumed the Vice Presidency. "One of our interactions happened when India was battling a very tough wave of COVID-19 infections. I recall your kind words of solidarity that time," Modi said. India was confronted with the second wave of the COVID 19 pandemic. "A very difficult time for India," he said. "Like a family, the sense of kinship and so warmly, you extended a helping hand, the words that you chose when you spoke to me, I will always remember that, and I'd like to thank you from the bottom of my heart," the Prime Minister said. "Like a true friend, you had given a message of cooperation, and were very full of sensitivity and immediately after that we found that the US government, the US corporate sector and the Indian community, all came together to help India," he said. Modi said that the US Government, companies based in the USA and the Indian diaspora were very helpful when India was fighting a tough wave of COVID-19 infections. Both leaders acknowledged the vibrant people-to-people linkages as the bedrock of the mutually beneficial education linkages and the flow of knowledge, innovation and talent between our two countries. Modi said that four million people of Indian origin are acting as a bridge of friendship between the two countries. Harris described India as a "very important partner" to the US and welcomed New Delhi's announcement that it will soon resume vaccine export. India stopped the export of COVID-19 vaccines after the second wave of the pandemic hit the country in April this year. On Monday, India said that it will resume export of surplus COVID-19 vaccines in the fourth quarter of 2021 under the ''Vaccine Maitri'' programme and to meet its commitment to the COVAX global pool. On the issue of the climate crisis, she told Modi that the US working together with India can have not only a profound impact on people of nations but around the world itself. Harris said that it is incumbent on the two nations to protect democracies in the best interests of people of the two countries. "As democracies around the world are under threat, it is imperative that we defend democratic principles and institutions within our respective countries and around the world. And that we maintain what we must do to strengthen democracies at home and it is incumbent on our nations to of course protect democracies in the best interests of people of our countries," she said. Their meeting comes a day ahead of the maiden bilateral meeting between Modi and President Joe Biden and the Quad Leaders' Summit at the White House on Friday. They also discussed areas of future collaboration, including space cooperation, Information Technology, especially emerging and critical technologies, as well as the cooperation in healthcare sector. Shringla said, the contribution of Indian professionals, especially in the IT domain, biotechnology, space, and other areas, which represent the knowledge economy was appreciated by both. There was a sense that India had capable professionals, in the high tech sector including research and development capacities, and the US which is known for cutting edge technologies and innovation, were obvious partners, he said. Shringla said that the Vice President has graciously accepted the invitation of the Prime Minister to visit India. PTI||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-180
24-09-2021||India||PM shares photo of himself going through files on board flight to US||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday shared on social media a picture of himself going through files on board his flight to the US and wrote: “A long flight also means opportunities to go through papers and some file work.” Several social media users pointed out that the picture was similar to another that had done the rounds a few days ago. That photograph showed former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri reading files on a plane. Some wondered why the sheaf of papers in Modi’s hand had been illuminated from below. BJP leaders and friendly media channels hailed Modi as a “workaholic”. Law minister Kiren Rijiju and BJP spokesperson Shaina NC tweeted almost identical posts: “Very proud of India’s Prime Minister @NarendraModi Ji who has never taken a single leave and on duty all the time in the service of the nation.” The sole difference was the minister had opted for “India’s Prime Minister” while the spokesperson said “our Prime Minister”. Did Shakespeare foresee the events when he wrote As You Like It? All the world’s a stage,… And one man in his time plays many parts,… With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his part.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-180
24-09-2021||India||PM CARES Fund a charitable trust, PMO tells Delhi High Court||The Prime Minister’s Office has told Delhi High Court that the PM CARES Fund is not a Government of India fund but a charitable trust whose collections do not go to the Consolidated Fund of India and that it does not come under the purview of the Right to Information Act. The Narendra Modi government has also dismissed as “irrelevant” a petitioner’s appeal that the Centre make it clear whether the fund comes under the ambit of the definition of “State” as mentioned in Article 12 of the Constitution. According to Article 12, “the State includes the government and Parliament of India and the government and the legislature of each of the states and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the government of India”. If the PM CARES Fund is not part of the “State”, it would mean that the government is not liable to make public any information related to it under the RTI Act. Not including PM CARES under the Consolidated Fund of India, which is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India and into which all government receipts flow, would free the government of the need to seek Parliament’s permission to make payments from it or be answerable for its strictest sanctity. The PM CARES Fund has been set up to tackle the Covid crisis. In an affidavit filed by the undersecretary at the PMO, Pradeep Kumar Srivastava, before the bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Amit Bansal, the PMO said: “It is reiterated that the Trust’s fund is not a fund of the Government of India and the amount does not go in the Consolidated Fund of India. “In view of the submissions made hereinabove, it is respectfully prayed that this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to dismiss the present petition. The answering respondent prays accordingly.” The PMO has sought the dismissal of a petition filed last year by social activist Samyak Gangwal seeking a direction to the PMO to disclose whether the PM CARES Fund is a government fund, if it falls under the definition of “State” and whether the RTI Act applies to it. The PMO affidavit by Srivastava said: “I submit that I am discharging my functions in the PM CARES Trust on honorary basis which is a charitable Trust not created by or under the Constitution of India or by any law made by the Parliament or by any state legislature. Despite being an officer of the Central Government, I am permitted to discharge my functions in PM CARES Trust on honorary basis. “…The prayers made in (the petition)… is not maintainable for the purpose of the Right to Information Act in general and Section 2(h) in particular which is irrelevant whether an authority, body or institution is a ‘State’ within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India.” Section 2(h) defines a public authority. The PMO questioned the locus of the petitioner. “When the petitioner is claiming to be a public-spirited person and seeking to pray for various reliefs only for transparency, it does not matter whether PM CARES is a ‘State’ within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India,” the affidavit stated. The PMO said transparency was maintained, and the fund was audited and the details uploaded for public viewing. “The Trust functions with transparency and its funds are audited by an auditor who is a chartered accountant drawn from the panel prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. To ensure transparency, the audited report is put on the official website of the Trust along with the details of utilisation of funds received by the Trust,” the affidavit said. It stated that irrespective of whether the Trust was a “State” or any other authority within the meaning of Article 12 or whether it was a “public authority” within the meaning of Section 2(h) of the RTI Act, “it is not permissible to disclose third party information”. However, the PMO said, “All donations received by the Trust are received via online payments, cheques and/ or demand drafts and the amount so received is audited with the audited report and the expenditure of Trust fund displayed on the website.” On August 16 last year the Supreme Court had dismissed a PIL filed by the NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) questioning the legal validity of the PM CARES Trust on the ground that it was not subject to audits by the CAG or answerable to citizens’ queries under the RTI Act. While upholding the validity of the fund, the apex court had ruled that the mere fact that the administration of the trust was vested in trustees like the Prime Minister and his cabinet colleagues would not take away the public character of the trust. The court also said the PM CARES Fund was a charitable trust that did not receive any budgetary support or government money. The Modi government’s submission in Delhi High Court has resurrected the questions raised about the fund when it was launched in the fag end of March 2020. This is not the first time the Centre has claimed that PM CARES is not a government of India fund. This has been the government’s stock response to efforts to bring the fund under the ambit of the RTI Act. Many of the questions floating on social media stemmed from this reluctance on the part of the government to subject the fund to scrutiny under the RTI law, particularly in view of its assertions on transparency and accountability. Some of the questions raised after the PMO affidavit became public on Thursday included how a non-government entity had been allowed to use the government’s emblem, why Indian diplomatic missions across the world had been asked to seek donations for the fund, and why it was made eligible for corporate social responsibility donations. CSR donations can’t be made to the chief ministers’ relief funds. As a result of the push given by the government to the PM CARES Fund, the state governments, which did much of the heavy lifting relating to providing health facilities during the pandemic and bore the additional cost of providing free rations during the lockdown, and NGOs have been having trouble getting donations. More so, because there has been a general tightening of purses. In refusing to put the PM CARES Fund under RTI scrutiny and CAG audit, the Modi government has essentially borrowed the provisions of the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund, set up in 1948. The government is yet to give a satisfactory reply to the question why a separate fund was needed when India already had the PMNRF for all such exigencies.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-180
24-09-2021||India||Qutab Minar and Victoria Memorial not among 100 tourist destinations||A lock on India Gate, a putdown for the Qutab Minar, amnesia about the Victoria Memorial. The University Grants Commission has sent universities a list of 100 “tourist destinations” for organising student visits as part of the Centre’s Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat programme. Some academics have questioned the move as dictatorial, and the choice of sites as biased. “Which places students should visit should be left to individual institutions; why should the UGC or the government prescribe it?” said Abha Dev Habib, former member of Delhi University’s executive council. Pankaj Jha, history professor at Lady Shri Ram College, underlined the absence of many famous sites associated with Muslim and colonial rule as well as those reflective of independent India’s achievements. “There is a greater emphasis on the sites of ancient (apparently Hindu) history rather than medieval (apparently Muslim) or modern (apparently colonial but also Independent India) period,” Jha wrote in response to a query from The Telegraph. A host of ancient Buddhist sites figure on the list too. “The claim is that it would make students ‘understand the rich culture and diversity of the country’, but this top-down dictum for all students hardly promotes diversity. This is a clear attempt to promote uniformity not just of practice but also of thinking,” Jha wrote. While Bijapur and Murshidabad, both associated with the medieval period and Muslim rule, are on the list, the Red Fort and Humayun’s Tomb in Delhi have been snubbed. Agra, however, gets a mention under “monuments included in list of World Heritage and Iconic Sites” although the Taj Mahal is not named. Delhi — Old and New — with its layers and layers of history buried and alive across hundreds of monuments has been entirely ignored. Ditto Calcutta, the capital of British India till 1911, and Mumbai, hub of finance and films and the birthplace of the Indian Railways. Colonial structures like the two Victorias — Memorial and Terminus — are missing as are the Cellular Jail in the Andamans and Rashtrapati Bhavan, India Gate and the Gateway to India. Goa has two mentions, though — Old Goa and Colva Beach. The nudge to all the universities came in a letter, dated September 22, from UGC secretary Rajnish Jain that said the National Education Policy proposes to strengthen and promote the spirit of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat among students. “A list of 100 tourist destination shared by the ministry of tourism is enclosed. Educational institutions are required to send students under Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat Programme to study the destinations and their history, scientific contributions, traditions, indigenous literature and knowledge, etc, as a part of augmenting their knowledge about different areas to understand the rich culture and diversity of the country,” Jain wrote. “All the higher educational institutions are requested that the visits may be organised only when Covid restrictions are lifted fully. Meanwhile students can be encouraged to learn about these locations and have activities digitally.” The letter added: “A report of the activities undertaken may be sent to ministry of education.” Jha said the UGC move was in line with the government’s recent attempts to closely “control and regulate” academic activities in institutions of higher education. So, all students of all streams, all regions, and all universities have been asked to visit the same set of sites, he said. “Are most of our achievements confined to the ancient period? Did the residents of this subcontinent stop growing after the ancient period? Did we never learn or did anything remarkable in the medieval and modern period?” Jha asked. The Northeast is heavily represented on the list, with Imphal, Aizawl and Itanagar featuring under the head “capital of state” — although Itanagar has been placed in Nagaland rather than Arunachal Pradesh — and Agartala, Dimapur, Dibrugarh and Silchar mentioned for their “airports”. Shillong makes it under “identified for wi-fi based on footfalls” — a strange and unexplained description that occurs about 30 times on the list, covering sites from Chilika Lake and Nagarjunakonda (Buddhist site in Andhra Pradesh) to Fort Kochi and the Jain pilgrimage spot of Sravanabelagola in Karnataka. But Bangalore gets a thumbs-down, despite its contribution to Indian science (IISc and Isro) and the country’s infotech revolution. Sarnath, Shravasti, Kapilavastu and Kushinagar of Uttar Pradesh and Bodhgaya, Vaishali and Rajgir of Bihar make it under “Buddhist Circuit”. Somnath and Dholavira (archaeological site in Kutch) in Gujarat are “iconic sites”. Jammu and Kashmir gets the nod in the form of Gulmarg, Pahalgam and Patnitop while Ladakh contributes Kargil and the Pangong Lake — sites of old and current confrontations with neighbours. Khajuraho from Madhya Pradesh and Konarak from Odisha are included as “world heritage sites”. An email was sent to UGC chairman D.P. Singh asking whether the commission had tried to find out from the tourism ministry why it had excluded Delhi and its monuments from the list. It remained unanswered. Another email to the tourism ministry seeking the reasons for the absence of some apparently obvious candidates evoked no response, either.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-180
24-09-2021||India||Supreme Court to set up expert panel on Israeli spyware Pegasus ||Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana on Thursday said the Supreme Court would pass orders next week on the constitution of an “expert committee” to probe allegations that the government had used the Israeli spyware Pegasus to illegally snoop on citizens. The court’s decision implies a prima facie finding that there might be some substance to the allegations and an inference that only an independent probe can establish the truth. Justice Ramana said the court would have passed the order this week but had to postpone it to next week because some of the prospective members for the proposed committee it wanted involved had expressed inability to take up the task citing personal reasons. There was no hearing of the Pegasus case on Thursday. Justice Ramana conveyed the decision during the morning mentioning time in open court, while sitting on a bench that included Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli. “Mr C.U. Singh, I wanted to tell you that on this Pegasus case, we wanted to pass this week some orders appointing a committee. But we could not pass the orders because many of the members who we had in our mind said they cannot participate due to personal reasons,” he told senior lawyer Singh. Singh represents some among the batch of more than two dozen petitioners who have sought a court-monitored special investigation team (SIT) probe into allegations of Pegasus-enabled snooping on judges, lawyers, activists, journalists and others. He was in the court on Thursday in connection with a different matter. Justice Ramana did not elaborate on the composition, nature or contours of the committee. The committee is expected to include a few information technology experts and possibly a retired Supreme Court judge. The court decision comes after the Centre refused to file a fresh affidavit either admitting or denying the allegations of illegal surveillance through Pegasus — a point its earlier two-page affidavit did not clarify. The Centre has claimed it cannot file the fresh affidavit because making the matter public would hurt national security. On September 13, the apex court had given the government three days to reconsider its decision, failing which it said it would pass the necessary orders. “Mr Mehta, beating around the bush is not the question here…. You have two-three days, Mr Mehta; if you have any rethinking you can mention before this court,” Justice Ramana had told solicitor-general Tushar Mehta on September 13. “We are not interested to know about national interest issues but we are only (interested in the matter) in the face of allegations that some software was used to snoop on certain citizens like lawyers, etc. We wanted to know if it’s done and, if so, to see if it is permissible under law….” Justice Ramana had added: “You have been repeatedly saying that you don’t want to put anything on affidavit. We also don’t want security issues to be put here. Presumably a committee has to be formed and then the report will be submitted here. Now we have to look into the whole issue and decide something. Then everything will be in public.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-181
24-09-2021||India||Rs 50,000 compensation to families of Covid victims a crude joke: Cong||The Congress on Thursday blasted the Narendra Modi government for filing an affidavit in the Supreme Court proposing a compensation of Rs 50,000 to the families of Covid victims, saying this demonstrated the arrogance and insensitivity of a regime that was initially reluctant to offer any assistance at all. Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said: “We demand Rs 5 lakh for every death. There is no scarcity of money. The Modi government has earned Rs 4 lakh crore from the people by taxing petroleum products last year alone. The official figure of Covid deaths is 4.5 lakh. The government will require only Rs 22,000 crore to give Rs 5 lakh each for every death. After all, such a large number of people died because of the government’s mismanagement.” Arguing that the offer of Rs 50,000 was like rubbing salt in the wound, Shrinate said: “This is a crude joke. Rs 50,000 is spent in getting a patient admitted to a hospital. People were struggling to get admission, there was no medicine, no injection, not even oxygen. The main breadwinner of the family has died in many cases. Young people have lost their lives. Children have been orphaned. What will happen with Rs 50,000? Why can’t the government return Rs 22,000 crore from the Rs 4 lakh crore they have extorted from the people?” Recalling that the Modi government was initially not willing to pay any compensation, as is manifested in the earlier affidavits, the Congress spokesperson alleged that they agreed to shell out Rs 50,000 when no option was left after being rebuked by the Supreme Court. The government had earlier told the court that Covid was not a natural disaster. This was rejected by the court. Shrinate said: “The offer of Rs 50,000 is also illegal. On April 8, 2015, the same Modi government released amended guidelines under the NDRF (National Disaster Response Fund), clearly stating that Rs 4 lakh will be given to the family of a person dying because of natural disasters. Even the petitioners had demanded Rs 4 lakh. Modi is now violating the law framed by his own government. What is the basis of calculating Rs 50,000 when the extent of tragedy is so big?” She also raised questions about the PM CARES Fund, wondering what was being done with the thousands of crores collected for Covid relief. “The money was collected from public sector units, corporate houses and individuals in the name of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister’s Office and the Government of India emblem were used for collecting funds. Why is there no accountability?” Shrinate asked. There has been confusion about the PM CARES Fund as the government has given different replies in response to different RTI queries. Finally, it has said in court that the fund is a private trust and doesn’t belong to the Government of India. Shrinate insisted there was no dearth of resources and said: “Rs 5 lakh be fixed as compensation amount. There should not be any attempt to hide the number of actual deaths. The state governments should be asked to conduct surveys to ascertain the number of deaths and accept the claims for compensation.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-181
24-09-2021||India||Suicide kin on central government's Covid cash list||The Centre on Thursday submitted in the Supreme Court a set of guidelines on eligibility for the ex gratia of Rs 50,000 pledged to the family of each Covid dead, including among the beneficiaries the kin of those who died by suicide after testing positive. In an affidavit, the Centre said the guidelines would be “binding” on all state governments and urged the apex court to make this point clear in its order. The ex gratia is to be paid from the state disaster relief funds. The affidavit filed through the Union home ministry has fixed the following criteria to determine a Covid death: ⚫ Proof of diagnosis of Covid through an RT-PCR, rapid antigen or molecular test. Clinical determination of Covid through other investigations in a hospital or any other inpatient facility by the attending doctor will also be accepted. ⚫ A death certificate issued by a doctor in hospital or at home through Forms 4 and 4A, as required under Section 10 of the Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969. ⚫ Deaths occurring within 30 days of testing positive for Covid or collection of samples that yield a positive result. It will be immaterial whether the death had taken place in hospital or at home or elsewhere. ⚫ Deaths occurring after 30 days of remaining in hospital or any other inpatient facility. ⚫ Review and rectifications will be allowed of certificates of death issued before the guidelines dated September 3, 2021, came into force. Fresh certificates issued after rectifications will also be accepted. The central government affidavit states that the next of kin of the Covid dead will be at liberty to raise grievances before district-level committees that the states will have to set up for selection of beneficiaries. The families of those whose death certificates do not recognise Covid as the reason before the guidelines came into force but could now be identified as Covid deaths under the new rules will also be permitted to approach these committees. “On such application, the district-level committee will examine the contemporaneous medical records of the deceased patient in light of the guidelines dated 3.09.2021, and if the district-level committee comes to the conclusion that the case of the applicant indeed falls within the parameters contemplated under the guidelines… then (it) would issue a fresh or corrected certificate for the deceased in accordance with the guidelines… certifying his death to be a Covid-related death eligible for financial/other assistance as provided by the central government/SDRF,” the affidavit says. The committees will have the power to look into disputes between a hospital and a family regarding the cause of death. The government has made it clear that the Union home ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research has clarified that all Covid-related death certificates issued before the guidelines came into force and those corrected or issued afresh after that will be considered as valid documents. “Furthermore, in addition to the above, this Hon’ble court may also pass a mandamus directing all state governments/UTs to constitute the said committee within 30 days in the interest of justice,” the central government affidavit says. According to the Centre, “all the state governments are respondents in the present petition and the guidelines have been framed in pursuance” of the apex court’s directions. “Hence, it is binding on state governments to implement it.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-181
24-09-2021||India||Union government plea against Kerala HC order on Covishield||The Union government has filed an appeal before Kerala High Court against its order reducing the interval between two doses of Covishield vaccine to 28 days from 84 days. The appeal was filed on Wednesday against the September 6 order of the single-judge bench of Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar that allowed Kitex Garments Ltd’s petition to administer the second dose of Covishield after 28 days of the first one. The order had meant that people across the country would have benefited from the shorter interval between the two doses of the vaccine just like the indigenously manufactured Covaxin. The Centre’s appeal is based on the argument that the order of the single-judge bench was against the policy of the Union government that had opposed the Kitex plea for shortening the duration citing better efficacy in the 84-day interval. “The precedent if allowed to stay would set at naught the national policy for administration of vaccine and would cause serious prejudice for the larger segment. The judgment would militate against the settled position that in matters related to government supported by scientific study, the Court shall not meddle with or substitute its view with the view of the administration,” The Union government represented by assistant solicitor-general P. Vijayakumar stated in the appeal. In seeking the dismissal of Kitex’s petition, the Union government had stated that “the decision to increase the dose interval of Covishield vaccine was based on scientific evidences and expert opinion as per available efficacy data”. But the single-judge bench had allowed the plea by Kitex citing concessions given to NRIs and students travelling abroad. “If the government can permit persons who are intending to travel abroad to exercise a choice between early protection and better protection from Covid-19 infection, there is absolutely no reason why the same privilege shall not be extended to others who want early protection in connection with their employment, education etc,” the court had said. In its order, the single-judge bench had pointed out the absence of any compulsion on the people to get vaccinated. Hence, it had ruled, there was no reason for the government to stop them from taking an early second dose. Though the court had ordered the Centre to rectify its Cowin app to allow registration of the second dose of Covishield any time after 28 days of the first dose, the petitioner did not benefit from the order because the government did not make the changes. Sajeev T.K., general manager of Kitex Garments Ltd based in Kizhakkambalam in Ernakulam, told The Telegraph on Thursday that about 80 per cent of the employees who completed the 84-day interval had been inoculated. “We could have administered the second dose to all our employees and their families in just a few days if the government had modified the Cowin application,” he said. One of the biggest garment manufacturers in Kerala, Kitex had procured 10,000 second doses of Covishield through a private hospital to inoculate its employees and their family members. He said the company would continue the fight to reduce the vaccine interval as it would help others across the country. “Reducing the gap would only help people get faster protection from the Covid virus. So we will continue this fight,” he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-181

But it also gave him a sense of vindication, removing what he called a “stain”. Manzoor Ahmad Wagay on Thursday bared his heart before south Kashmir’s top army officer, describing how he had to face taunts from the police since his son, Rifleman Shakir Manzoor, disappeared on August 2 last year. Eyewitnesses suggested the soldier had been abducted by militants. But some police officers suggested he must have joined the militants or gone over to Pakistan for arms training, Wagay said, providing a peek into how the families of local soldiers were called on to prove their loyalty even during their worst trials. A day after the body was found, confirming Shakir had been killed by militants, the soldier was buried on Thursday with full military honours. In attendance were senior army officers, including the head of the counter-insurgency Victor Force, Major General Rashim Bali. Wagay’s pent-up hurt bubbled over at the event. “Naturally, as a father I’m sad. But I’m also happy because whenever I went to the police, they would express suspicion that he had joined the militants,” the 56-year-old told Bali before a large crowd. “I was living with a stain and felt humiliated. I’m happy that the stigma is removed.” Bali did not respond to Wagay’s remarks but thanked the people for joining the family’s searches on several occasions. A police officer in Kulgam did not answer a text message seeking a clarification. Shakir was kidnapped while he was travelling home to Reshipora, Shopian, to celebrate Id. He was dragged out of his car, which was torched. His body was found at Mohammedpora in neighbouring Kulgam, a few kilometres from Wagay’s home. Wagay said someone must have brought the body to the spot and dumped it, after which some residents informed him. He identified his son from his bracelet and stitch marks on his foot. For the preceding 13 months, Wagay had travelled from village to village, often with shovels and spades, to find his son’s body. He had been almost certain the militants had killed Shakir, for he had found some of the young man’s clothes at three places in nearby Landoora. Soon after the abduction, Wagay had appealed to the militants through videos to release Shakir or hand over his body if they had killed him, promising he would bear them no grudge. “My son was in the army.... It is your job to fight the army, I have no complaints against you if you have killed him,” Wagay had said in Urdu in one video. “I shall have no complaints if the mujahideen have abducted and killed him, but I shall have a complaint if his body is not returned to me.” Many people in Kashmir address the militants as mujahideen, a reverential term that roughly translates as “holy warrior”. It is understandable for a father whose son could be in militant captivity to use the word. “Don’t give me my son back (alive),” he had said. “If you don’t want to forgive (him), then return his body. I won’t reproach you.” Family sources said Shakir was listed as missing and not dead, which means the family was not entitled to any compensation during these months. Emotional scenes were witnessed at Shakir’s funeral, with many local women bidding him a tearful farewell.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-181
24-09-2021||India||Plea to Jagan Mohan Reddy on Odisha border row ||Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who hails from Odisha, has urged Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to withdraw its police force from a disputed area on the inter-state border. Andhra Pradesh has claimed sovereign rights on Kutia panchayat under Potangi block in Koraput district of Odisha which comprises 20 villages. Officials of both the states have also engaged in verbal duels a number of times while settling the border issues. The skirmishes have spread to other villages in the neighbouring Gajapati district of Odisha. The situation is likely to be more tense in the coming days as Odisha is gearing up for polls in the Kutia gram panchayat. The Andhra Pradesh government had already conducted polls in a few villages of the Kutia panchayat defying the Odisha government’s request not to hold an election. “In the interest of residents of both the Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, I seek your personal intervention for a conducive and mutually agreeable resolution of the matter,” Pradhan said in a letter to Jagan on Wednesday, adding that such a dispute poses a threat both to the security as well as to the developmental aspirations of villagers located in border villages in both the states. “The persistent volatile situation arising out of inter-state conflicts on the issue of delimitation of physical boundaries is extremely unfortunate and uncalled for,” Pradhan wrote. Pradhan urged Jagan to initiate steps for retreat of the armed police force in the disputed villages and immediate withdrawal of police cases registered against local representatives and government officials in both the states. “Except for essential public utility facilities of rural infrastructure, health, education and basic civic amenities, new structural construction and earth moving activities be put on hold, as these actions have led to the ongoing altercation,” Pradhan said. Pradhan also suggested a bilateral discussion between the chief ministers to lay the broad parameters of a future road map to address the issues and a joint working group talks at the level of chief secretaries and developmental commissioners of both the states. Odisha, which has borders with four states, is facing boundary disputes with Bengal as well. The Odisha government on Tuesday stopped the construction work of a guard wall by the government of the neighbouring state on the Udaipur sea beach, which is close to the Digha beach in Bengal. Sources said that Odisha is determined to not allow the work till a high-level meeting comprising senior officials of both the states settles the border dispute.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-181
24-09-2021||India||Bihar: Lalu Prasad’s ‘go green’ missive to RJD workers||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president Lalu Prasad has asked his workers to “go green” to strengthen the party in Bihar. Addressing party workers virtually on the final day of a two-day training camp in Patna on Wednesday, Lalu said: “Discipline is very important. Everybody should wear green caps just like the (red) caps of Samajwadi Party (of Uttar Pradesh), keep green gamchas with them and hoist green flags on their houses. The caps and gamchas are like our party’s licence. They will let government officials know that you are an RJD worker. The flags will establish our identity.” Asserting that the steps will inculcate discipline, unity and brotherhood among the party members, Lalu further asked them to “organise like the Left parties so that the RJD becomes stronger on the ground and the polling booths”. “Our party has such a huge public base in the state, yet our workers fail to show promptness at the polling booths. The public base of the Left parties is lesser than us, but their organisation is very strong because their leaders and workers have to regularly attend training camps,” Lalu said. “We also must hold regular training camps. We need to strengthen our organisation just like the Left parties. We need to have RJD workers at the booth level so that they could work vigorously and spare time for the party,” Lalu added. His emphasis on strengthening the party at the booth level is being seen as a step to counter the BJP, which has a strong organisation of workers at the polling booths. The leader, known for his rustic charm, also iterated that he would return to Bihar soon and tour all 38 districts to fight against the incompetent governments in the state and at the Centre. “I will come to Bihar very soon and tour each district in the state. We will fight against the state and central governments. Our party was defeated by unfair means in the 2020 Assembly elections,” Lalu said. The RJD chief is staying in New Delhi with his daughter and Rajya Sabha member Misa Bharti due to poor health after getting bail in fodder scam cases. His wife — former chief minister Rabri Devi — is also staying with them. The RJD workers, leaders and office-bearers from the block to district level attended the training camp. Lalu said that speeches delivered by the leaders at the training camps would awaken and broaden the mental horizon of the workers. Asserting that his younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has emerged as a strong leader and has been accepted by all the party workers and leaders, the RJD chief asked everybody to prepare for the future polls by demanding a caste census. “A caste census is the need of the hour. It will help provide reservation to different castes according to their population. We need to break the barrier of 27 per cent reservation for the Other Backward Classes. Even Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar has talked about reservation for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes on the basis of their population,” the RJD president said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-181
24-09-2021||India||Odisha: Sweetmeat seller arrested for poisoning 20 stray dogs||A 53-year-old sweetmeat seller in Odisha was arrested on Thursday for allegedly killing 20 stray dogs with poison in the last five days. The accused, Ajay Kumar Sahoo, was held following his latest killing of six stray dogs in the Shankarpur area of Choudwar in Cuttack on Wednesday. “We arrested Sahoo after he confessed to the crime and admitted that he killed the dogs as they were creating nuisance in the area and near his shop. Their constant howling at night also disturbed his sleep,” an officer of Choudwar police station told The Telegraph. State secretary of the People for Animals, Jiban Ballav Das, told this newspaper: “The accused had mixed poison in a food item and fed it to the dogs, killing six of them on Wednesday. Among the six dogs, three were pregnant and could have given birth in recent days.” Das said the accused had mixed a poison called danadar (germicide) in gulgula (food item) and gave it to the dogs to eat. After consuming the poisoned gulgula, the canines vomited. They were all found dead on Wednesday afternoon. Das said: “The accused has so far poisoned to death about 20 stray dogs, including these six. After we brought it to the notice of the director-general of police, the police today arrested the accused and produced him in court.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-181
24-09-2021||India||Congress demands investigation into Pegasus snooping row||The Congress on Thursday iterated its demand for an investigation into the Pegasus snooping row, describing the Supreme Court’s decision to set up a “technical committee” to look into the matter as a step in the right direction. Party communications chief Randeep Surjewala tweeted: “Pegasus spy scandal is not an issue to protect ‘national security’ but an assault on ‘national security & privacy’ by Narendra Modi Government. The solution is simple: A Supreme Court-monitored full investigation. The Supreme Court observation of setting up a ‘technical committee’ is a right step in this direction.” Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said: “As far as the Supreme Court is concerned, I would want to react to it solely based on what I have read in media reports, watched on TV channels…. What happened with the Pegasus snooping scandal was the greatest threat to national security. A probe into this will ensure that national security is never compromised. “Please understand, who were the people snooped upon? It was not just political opponents, they were people in constitutional positions. They were people associated with the Chief Justice of India. They were people associated with the Election Commission.” Shrinate added: “These are very, very serious allegations. The reality is that snooping was done on people who were in elected positions of power (ministers), which also compromises the Official Secrets Act, and there was never a bigger compromise with national security than Pegasus. “There has to be a full-fledged probe under the supervision of the Supreme Court. Anything less than that is not going to be satisfactory.” Former finance minister P. Chidambaram referred to the drug seizure at the Adani-operated Mundra port in Gujarat and tweeted: “The seizure of over 3,000kg of heroin is unprecedented and points to a major crime syndicate operating freely in India. The same accused are reported to have successfully ‘imported’ a large quantity in June 2021 and got away with it. An import of this magnitude could not be attempted by anyone without official patronage at a high level. Why are the Prime Minister, Home Minister and Finance Minister silent on the incident?” The Congress had demanded an enquiry under the monitoring of the Supreme Court in this issue as well. The government has so far not commented on the drug seizure.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-181

Such elephants trample democratic processes, laws, political culture under their feet and set new precedence.” The Sena asked whether it was appropriate that the governors were using all their power to destabilise state governments because they had been formed by non-BJP parties.

This is the first time such a list is being prepared by the police. Those to be included in the list will be identified on the basis of four offences — jumping the red light, speeding, drink driving and dangerous driving. Special commissioner of police (traffic) Muktesh Chander said the motive was to inform the errant drivers that their driving skills were “very poor” and they needed to improve. “The motive is to tell them that their driving is so bad that they end up violating rules regularly. They themselves are in danger as well as their family and relatives who commute with them. People on the road are also in danger,” he said. “We want to tell them that their driving habits are not good and they should join our road safety classes,” he added. If an offender does not join the classes despite being asked repeatedly and keeps committing traffic offences, his or her licence will be cancelled permanently under the Motor Vehicles Act, the officer said. They will not be given a licence in the future as well.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-182

The PM-Cares fund bears our national emblem, but the central government has insisted that it is not a government fund, "leaving us all confused", the chief minister said, tongue in cheek. "The Chief Minister Relief Fund is regularly audited. PM-Cares fund was formed for Covid-19, but yesterday they (Centre) told the court that it is not a government fund. Government employees have donated money there, funds through CSR have been donated there, lakhs of crores of rupees have been donated. So where is that money?" she fumed. The Centre has informed the Delhi High Court that the PM-Cares Fund is not a government fund as donations to it do not go to the Consolidated Fund of India, and no third party information can be parted with irrespective of its status under the Constitution and the Right to Information (RTI) Act. An affidavit filed by an Under-Secretary at the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), who is discharging his functions in the PM Cares Trust on honorary basis, has said that the trust functions with transparency and its funds are audited by an auditor -- a chartered accountant drawn from the panel prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. Mamata, during her campaign in bypoll-bound Bhabanipur constituency, also hit out at the BJP-led Union government over the Pegasus snooping scandal, claiming that the country's opposition leaders were being spied on. "It has been proven that the Union government snoops on opposition leaders; our phones are tapped. The Centre bought this software from Israel to snoop on us. No one can speak out against them. If you speak out, efforts will be made to intimidate you by using (central) agencies," she claimed. The Trinamul boss further criticised the state unit of the saffron party for "carrying out a demonstration" near her residence on Thursday with the body of a BJP worker. "Yesterday, BJP leaders staged a protest outside my residence over the death of a BJP worker. That BJP worker died a natural death, and they are claiming that he died during violence. We won't tolerate such hooliganism. If they think they can protest outside my residence with a dead body, we, too, can do the same outside their homes with the carcass of a dog. "We can teach them a lesson in the language they understand," she said. The chief minister maintained that her fight against the "demonic BJP" would continue till it is ousted from power, and after winning the Bhabanipur by-poll, the party would take its battle to other states. Mamata, who is contesting the September 30 bypoll from the Bhabanipur seat to retain her chief minister's chair, claimed that destiny had this plan in store for her. "People want me to be a representative from this seat and continue as the state's chief minister," said the feisty Trinamul leader, who lost to the BJP's Suvendu Adhikari in Nandigram during the April-May Assembly polls. Mamata has to get elected to legislature by November 5, in conformity with the constitutional provisions, to continue as the chief minister. Shortly after the poll results were announced in May, state cabinet minister and Trinamul MLA from Bhabanipur Sovandeb Chattopadhyay vacated the seat to facilitate her return to the assembly from there. A resident of Bhabanipur, Mamata had won the seat twice in 2011 and 2016 but shifted to Nandigram, where the anti-farmland acquisition movement against the Left Front government had transformed her into a major political force in the volatile state, to dare her former protege and now BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari on his home turf. Though she powered the Trinamul to a resounding win for a third straight term in office, the TMC boss failed to register victory in Nandigram. The Chief Minister has claimed that a conspiracy was hatched to hurt her and defeat her in Nandigram. She had suffered an injury on a leg during electioneering in the constituency. "If I speak about the conspiracy that was hatched to injure me and kill me, all of you will be shocked. I had to move around in a wheelchair for 1.5 months. But that did not stop me from hitting the campaign trail," she said. The Trinamul supremo is pitted against BJP's Priyanka Tibrewal and Left Front's Srijib Biswas in Bhabanipur. The Congress did not field any candidate for the bypoll.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-75

24-09-2021||West Bengal||On Bhowanipore bypolls, high court has a few questions||Less than a week before the Bhowanipore Assembly by-elections, a set of questions raised by the Calcutta High Court has left the Election Commission of India as well as the Mamata Banerjee government scurrying for answers. A division bench of the high court, comprising acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Rajarshi Bharadwaj, reserved its judgement in the matter but questioned the necessity of winning candidates resigning from their constituencies to force bypolls, which could lead to wider electoral reforms once the matter comes to its logical conclusion. The Bhowanipore bye-election is scheduled for September 30. In its note issued on September 4, the election commission had referred to the West Bengal chief secretary’s claim, “…in view of the administrative exigencies and public interest and to avoid vacuum in the state bye-elections for 159 Bhabanipur-Kolkata from where Ms Mamata Banerjee Chief Minister intends to contest elections may be conducted.” The acting chief justice questioned whether the central poll panel agreed to the bye-election because the chief minister had expressed her desire to contest from a particular seat. “Can a chief secretary write that the CM wants to get elected from a particular constituency therefore bypolls be held?” asked acting chief justice Bindal. From 2011 onwards Mamata has represented the Bhowanipore Assembly seat twice. She moved to Nandigram this year, but there, she lost to BJP nominee Suvendu Adhikary. Soon after Mamata took oath as chief minister, Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay resigned from Bhowanipore to pave the way for his party chief to get elected to the Assembly. Unless Mamata gets elected by November 5, she would cease to be the chief minister. Soon after the EC’s announcement of the bypoll in Bhowanipore (along with Shamshergunj and Jangipur where elections were deferred), excluding 31 other Assemblies and three Parliamentary constituencies lying vacant across the country, Sayan Banerjee, a Calcutta high court  advocate, had filed a petition questioning why a particular constituency was being favoured. Chief secretary H.K. Dwivedi had also argued before the Election Commission that a “constitutional crisis” will prevail in Bengal if the Bhowanipore bypoll was not held. On Thursday, the high court asked the Election Commission to submit an affidavit on whether the CS could make such a recommendation. The commission could not give a satisfactory reply to the division bench’s question. “What is the role of the chief secretary behind writing this letter? The petition was filed on September 13, why couldn’t a satisfactory response be elicited till now? Why did the CS refer to a “constitutional crisis”, what is the constitutional crisis? Why is the exigency only for one constituency and not others?” asked the acting chief justice. To a query on poll-related expenses, the Election Commission had replied that Rs 3 crore was  spent on an election. “There is a growing trend of winning candidates resigning and money being spent unnecessarily on bypolls,” the bench observed. Hearings on this issue will continue.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-75
24-09-2021||West Bengal||Two more electrocuted, 48-hour toll rises to 8 in Kolkata||Two men were electrocuted at Agarpara and Belgharia, on the northern fringes of the city, on Wednesday night and Thursday morning. The places are near Khardah, where three members of a family were electrocuted on Tuesday, possibly when they were trying to charge a mobile phone in a flooded room. The twin deaths took the electrocution death toll in the Dum Dum-Khardah area to eight within a span of 48 hours. Police said they were making announcements in waterlogged areas asking people to be cautious while moving through flooded streets and switching on electrical appliances at home. However, the deaths indicate a lack of awareness among people about maintenance of electrical wiring. At least four of the electrocution victims died while charging mobile phones. Dipak Nath Chowdhury, 65, a resident of Tarapukur in Pashmim Pally in Agarpara, was electrocuted late on Wednesday when he was trying to open the collapsible gate of his house. The police said Chowdhury had gone out and was about to step in when the tragedy struck. His daughter was with him but escaped her father’s fate. Chowdhury was taken to BN Bose Hospital where he was declared dead. The police suspect cracks in the wiring of the doorbell, which was attached to the collapsible gate, could have caused the electrocution. Hours later, on Thursday morning, a contractual labourer at the Texmaco railway workshop was electrocuted after he plugged his mobile phone charger into the switch board and turned on the switch. The police said the entire ground floor of the workshop was flooded. The victim, Sona Roy, 36, was engaged in cleaning one of the officer’s rooms when he got electrocuted. Roy was taken to Kamarhati ESI Hospital where he was declared dead. An officer in the Barrackpore City Police said the exact cause of the electrocution could be ascertained only after forensic department officials examined the spot. The power utility company has been alerted, the officer said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-75
24-09-2021||West Bengal||Death lurks: Whose fault is it?||At least eight persons have been electrocuted in Kolkata and on the outskirts in 48 hours. Such deaths have become common after every spell of downpour. The deaths are followed by kind words and condolences. But no one is held responsible. Metro spoke to some of those in positions of power in places where the deaths have been reported from. From the Amphan experience we have learned that such incidents may happen after heavy rainfall. We have coordinated with the power service provider and asked them to investigate the deaths. We can carry out a probe if we receive a specific complaint. Otherwise, the police’s role is limited to creating awareness. We are making announcements about precautions. Q: On Wednesday, a senior official of the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company had said electrocutions inside private properties were not the look-out of the state electricity board. What do you think? A: This is wrong. Unless we know the cause of electrocution, how do we create awareness? I have sought a report on all electrocution deaths. Q: Who is responsible for the electrocution deaths in the city? A: I will not be able to answer that before the investigation reports come. We are only the power supply agency. Q: Do you think the state is doing enough to create awareness? A: Awareness drives have always been there. Spokesperson for CESC (the utility that supplies power to Dum Dum, where two 12-year-old girls died from electrocution on Wednesday) Q: Who is responsible for the electrocution deaths in Dum Dum? A: We are only a power supply agency. Lamp posts are set up and maintained by the local civic body. Q: As the area is still waterlogged, who will decide whether the power supply should be on or off? There could be more such accidents. A: We act on orders from the local civic body that maintains lamp posts. In this case, it is South Dum Dum Municipality. The area where the girls were electrocuted was part of Ward 9 Metro called Roy Chowdhury at 9.13pm. The man who answered the call, without introducing himself, asked the identity of the reporter and then said Roy Chowdhury was busy in a meeting and could take calls only the next morning. A WhatsApp message was sent to Roy Chowdhury’s mobile number asking whether the junction box attached to the lamp post that caused the deaths was open and whether South Dum Dum Municipality was responsible for its maintenance. No reply came till late on Thursday. Q: Is it true that the lamp post that caused the death of the girls had its junction box open and wires were exposed? A: That is hearsay. The executive electrical engineer (of the municipality) has to send a report in three days. I will be able to tell only after I get the report. I have asked the electrical wing to conduct a survey across the 35 wards (of the municipality). If any post is found faulty, it will be replaced.

Among the dead are two 12-year-old girls, Anushka Nandi and Sneha Banik, who were returning after taking private tuition on Wednesday evening. Between Wednesday night and Thursday morning, two men were electrocuted on the northern fringes of Calcutta.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-76
24-09-2021||West Bengal||‘LPG leak’ blast tied to mobile charging||Four of a family in Beckbagan were injured in an explosion possibly triggered when a family member switched on a mobile charger connected to a switchboard in a room filled with LPG gas because of an overnight cylinder leak, police said. “Preliminary findings of forensic department officials suggest it was a vapour cloud explosion,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. Three of the four victims have been hospitalised with burns. Anand Das, 40, wife Kiran, 35, son Shivan, 7, and niece Bhumi Chowdhury, 16, were in the house on the ground floor of a five-storey building in Ahiripukur First Lane, close to Beckbagan. The incident happened after 5.30am on Thursday, one of their relatives said. “I received a call early in the morning from my younger sister. She said there was an explosion in her home. I rushed over and found that their house had been damaged and my brother-in-law was seriously injured and covered in debris. My sister and nephew were also injured. Many people had gathered to see them but no one was coming forward to help them,” said Kiran’s elder brother Vijay Nayak. A wall of the house and a portion of the main door exploded. Such was the intensity of the blast that a window grille was twisted out of shape under its impact. Nayak said his sister told him that the family was sleeping when his brother-in-law Anand woke up and went to the washroom. On returning, he plugged his mobile phone to the charger and switched it on when the explosion happened. Anand, who his landlady said works as a cook at a consulate, and Kiran have been admitted to a private hospital on Park Street. Their son has been admitted to SSKM Hospital and niece Bhumika was treated and discharged from the hospital. Anand suffered the most severe burns, including on his hair and face. Kiran had burns on her hands while their son injured his hands and legs. Investigators said they had found two LPG cylinders in the house, one of which was empty. “According to a preliminary opinion of the forensic science laboratory (FSL), an electric spark could have triggered the explosion as the air was already heavy with leaked gas, possibly from the gas cylinder,” said an officer. The switch board and the electrical connections of the house were also being examined by the FSL team, the officer added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-76
24-09-2021||West Bengal||Dead child’s family refuses compensation||The family of 12-year-old Anushka Nandi, who died from electrocution along with friend Sneha Banik after one of them touched a light post in a flooded street in Dum Dum in Kolkata, refused to take the Rs 2 lakh the state government offered as compensation on Thursday. Anushka’s family told Dum Dum MP Saugata Roy, state education minister Bratya Basu and Pachu Ray, the chairperson of South Dum Dum Municipality’s board of administrators, to leave their house when they arrived with an entourage to express grief. “We don’t need your money. If you really want to help, bring our daughter back to life. Else, please leave this house,” Anushka’s mother Priyanka told Roy. She told this newspaper that they did not need any money from the government. What they want is action against Surajit Roy Chowdhury, the coordinator of Ward 9 of South Dum Dum Municipality, where the incident happened, for criminal negligence. “They cannot fix a price on our daughter’s head. All the lamp posts in our area have exposed wiring and the entire locality gets waterlogged whenever it rains. We had asked Roy Chowdhury to do something about it but he did not heed to any of our requests,” said Priyanka. The 12-year-olds were returning home from tuition wading through water on Wednesday night when one of them accidentally touched a lamp post with exposed wires. She got electrocuted. The other girl tried to help her and got electrocuted, too. The principal responsibility of maintaining lamp posts in all wards of South Dum Dum lies with South Dum Dum Municipality. Roy Chowdhury, the coordinator of the ward, passed the blame to CESC. “We can do little about waterlogging as the main drainage channel, Bagjola canal, is overflowing. The maintenance of electrical lines as well as posts rests with CESC and I cannot do anything about it,” said Roy Chowdhury. Metro on Thursday found the entire neighbourhood flooded and almost all lamp posts had electrical wires jutting out. The hatches on most of the posts — meant for carrying out maintenance and repairs — were open, increasing chances of someone coming in contact with a live wire again. Residents said this was the way they had been over several years. After the deaths on Wednesday night, some of the hatches have been hurriedly taped. Koel Dey, a schoolteacher, who used to teach dance to Anushka and Sneha, said residents had visited the ward office and told the ward assistant about the state of affairs but nothing was done. “It has taken the deaths of two young girls to finally nudge the authorities into some action. But even then they have done a shoddy job,” said Dey. Residents of the locality who had gathered to catch a last glimpse of the two children said they were living in fear. Ray, the chairperson of South Dum Dum Municipality’s board of administrators, said they had formed a committee to probe the deaths. “We will have a report in three days and take action against anybody who has been negligent,” said Ray.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-76
24-09-2021||West Bengal||Bengal keen to vaccinate all college students in early October||The Bengal government set to start Covid-19 vaccination drives for students enrolled in 550 colleges and 40 universities across the state in early October in a bid to open the institutions for in-person classes in November. District magistrates and chief medical officers were instructed by senior health and education officials in Calcutta via a videoconference on Thursday afternoon to send a database of college and varsity students’ vaccination status within this week and start the process of vaccinating them “as soon as possible”. Colleges, universities and schools in Bengal have been officially closed since the first outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020. “District officials have been asked to send students' vaccination statuses within this week and to chalk out a plan for vaccinating students with special priority. The drive was conceived after a recent communication from the higher education department expressing their desire to open campuses of certain educational institutions soon,” said a senior health department official in Calcutta. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee in August had said  the state government would try to open schools and colleges after Puja vacations on alternate days in an effort to wait out a possible third wave. “After Puja vacations, we will try to reopen schools and colleges on alternate days,” Mamata had said at Nabanna after a meeting with the state's global advisory board on Covid-19 headed by Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee on August 5 this year. Sources said several colleges and universities have sent a primary database of students to the higher education department, in order to help the health department assess the needs of vaccine doses. “We have asked colleges and universities to give a database with the status of students’ vaccination as many students may have taken jabs on their own. As soon as we get the database ready, we will not delay a day to start the vaccination,” said Bidhan Ray, Birbhum district magistrate. There are over 550 colleges and some 40 universities in Bengal. Nearly 10 lakh students are waiting for both doses. According to a primary survey, around 3.5 lakh students have got the first dose. Under a tentative plan, the government has asked college and university authorities to open vaccination camps on campuses before Durga Puja and invite students with a schedule based on the daily capacity of doses. “Health department officials will be deployed to organise such camps. However, there will be an option for students who live far away from their respective campuses to get vaccinated from the nearest government-run vaccination centre,” said an official. Ashis Kumar Panigrahi, pro-vice chancellor of Burdwan University, said all heads of departments would coordinate with the varsity to send a database to the higher education department this week. “We have around 3,000 students and all of them have been given online forms to furnish their details,” he said. Many college and varsity teachers said they were worried for students in science or engineering courses as they can’t attend practicals with institutions staying shut. “Once campuses open, it will be of great help to them. In-person classes are crucial for students of humanities too,” said a professor at Visva-Bharati. Sources said the government is also focusing on full vaccination of teachers and staff of government-run schools too. It is planning to reopen schools on alternate days. “We need to ensure that all teachers and staff are vaccinated. As most teachers were on election duty during the recent Assembly polls, it is presumed that most have already received both doses. But we will make sure that the staff in schools have been fully vaccinated,” said a source in the health department.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-76
24-09-2021||West Bengal||Power turned off in flood zones in East Midnapore||Rain-related woes continued into Thursday in East Midnapore, where a 10-day spell of near continuous rain battered dykes and caused widespread inundation, displacement and fatalities related mostly to electrocution. Bhagabanpur and Patashpur blocks remained largely without power till Thursday. “Most substations in the blocks have been submerged. Although there were no fresh incidents of electrocution, substations that did not get submerged have been turned off for safety,” said a West Bengal State Electricity and Distribution Company Limited (WBSEDCL) official. “That brings the total number of days without electricity in the blocks to four as of Thursday. Over one lakh people have been without power,” the official added. On Thursday morning, residents of Bhagabanpur and Patashpur raised a blockade on the Egra-Bajpur state highway near Manglamaro to protest against their continuing predicament. “It is an injustice. It does not take one week to fix power lines, even if the damage has been substantial. We now believe the only way out for us is to create a scene about it, unfortunately,” said Chinmay Das, one of the nearly 1,000 protesters. Sources said the Keleghai river, which reportedly caused widespread damage, was still flowing above the normal level on Thursday. Following the electrocution of two relief workers in Bhagabanpur’s Itiberia on Tuesday, the Contai divisional area manager (transmission) and Madhakhali station manager were showcaused by the power utility. “As there is no electricity, pumps are not functioning and we are facing an acute drinking water crisis. We have been forced to buy water,” said a resident of Bibhishanpur, where one electric tower was reportedly angled into caving slush on Wednesday. Another resident of Bibhishanpur echoed his neighbour and vented ire against the administration for forcing them to live without power for days. “We can’t even charge our cellphones to make important calls. We have to travel a few kilometres from our waterlogged homes to pay and recharge our mobile phones from trucks equipped with generators,” she said. “We are aware of the protests. A committee is being formed to survey the areas in person so as to restore electricity in a safe manner,” said WBSEDCL regional manager Shyamal Hazra, adding that the committee would consist of the BDO, the local officer-in-charge, a substation manager and a panchayat representative. One more life was lost to waterlogging at Kajlaghar village in the district’s Bhagabanpur area early on Thursday. A child aged a little over one year was sleeping along with his parents when he fell from the bed into flood water that had entered the room. By the time the parents realised that the child had slipped off the bed, he had died of suffocation, police sources said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-76
24-09-2021||West Bengal||Funds crunch for children’s Covid units in Bengal ||The cash-strapped Bengal government has been forced to sanction only 679 paediatric intensive care units (PICU) beds in state-run hospitals across Bengal though it had initially planned on 1,300 such beds as part of its preparedness for the third wave of Covid-19, which is likely to impact children more. Health department sources said the state could not sanction the rest of the 621 beds as Nabanna could not give funds for new buildings. “A paediatric ventilator will cost around Rs 5 lakh to Rs 8 lakh. Even though the state government can afford the cost of machines, it can’t afford to set up new buildings to install these units,” said a senior state government official. The order issued on September 17 in which 435 PICUs out of 679 PICUs were sanctioned clearly stated that funds would be given for only minor renovation and installation of air-conditioning systems and other infrastructure. “This means it is clear that no new building would be allowed to be set up for PICUs. The problem is that a majority of the state-run hospitals don't have enough vacant space to convert into PICUs by installing additional ventilator beds,” said a senior government official. As of now, state-run hospitals have a total of 3,816 paediatric beds of which 229 beds are in PICU. The state government had identified the paucity of paediatric intensive care units in June and had taken initiatives to increase the number of beds in PICU keeping in mind that more children could be affected in Covid-19’s probable third wave. Initially, 244 beds in PICU were sanctioned in July. In September, another 435 PICU beds were sanctioned. Sources said more PICU beds are required in the state as intensive care units for children are different from those for adult patients. “In case of intensive care units for kids, it is necessary that the units have enough space to accommodate any of the parents of the sick child. This why more PICU beds could not be installed in existing facilities,” said a source. Some officials blamed both the Centre the state government for failing to arrange funds for this purpose. “The Centre did not give  special funds to develop infrastructure for children though it was being discussed these past few months that more children could be affected if the third wave comes as they are not vaccinated yet. Exactly this is how the Centre overlooked the need to generate more medical oxygen during the second wave,” said an official. Another official said the state government also failed to arrange funds.“It spent heavily to kick off welfare schemes promised by the chief minister ahead of polls. But it could have saved some money to develop Covid-19 treatment facilities for children,” the official added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-76
24-09-2021||West Bengal||Three protests in Siliguri over Covid-19 vaccine shortfall||Protests over shortage of Covid-19 vaccines erupted in at least three locations of Siliguri on Thursday. Among those who had to face protests was Gautam Deb, chairman of the board of administrators of Siliguri Municipal Corporation (SMC). Deb faced people’s ire at Buddha Bharati High School Haiderpara under ward 40.  According to sources, it was earlier announced that only 200 residents would get vaccines here. However, as more people kept coming, civic and health staff on duty had to turn away many. When Deb reached the venue at noon to check if vaccination was being held properly, angry residents surrounded him. “We stood in queue for hours and health workers are now saying we will not get vaccinated. We can’t accept this. You have to resolve the issue or else, we will continue with our protests,” one of them was heard telling Deb. Deb soon had the situation under control by saying that going by stocks, another 50 persons would get jabs. “For the rest, the camp will be organised on Friday as well. This ward (40) covers a large area and we will keep on organising camps in the coming days to cover the entire population,” he said. Another protest erupted at Pateshwari Junior High School in ward 41 with some residents alleging anomalies in the vaccination process. “Many of us have been standing in queue since early morning with coupons. But we saw many coming later without coupons and getting jabs,” said a protester. Civic employees calmed the crowd. The third protest was witnessed near the principal’s chamber in North Bengal Medical College & Hospital on the outskirts of the city. Sources said some who had come to collect coupons for vaccination got angry when they were denied coupons. “In all, 100 coupons were supposed to be distributed for the first dose of vaccination among people aged between 18 and 45. But as news spread, more people stood in queue. When they learnt no more coupons would be issued, they got angry,” said a source in NBMCH. Deb, when asked about the protests, blamed the Centre and said chief minister Mamata Banerjee time and again has said how the Centre was failing to send enough vaccines.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-76
24-09-2021||West Bengal||Advanced unit for kids launched in Cooch Behar||A 15-bedded sophisticated Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) was inaugurated at the Maharaja Jitendra Narayan (MJN) Medical College and Hospital here on Thursday. In Cooch Behar district, this is the first of its kind unit launched for children aged up to 12 years. Sushanta Roy, the officer on special duty deputed by the state health department in north Bengal, said the facility earlier had a Sick Neonatal Care Unit (SNCU). “It was a level II unit and in case of major complications, children had to be referred to the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital for treatment. The PICU is a level III unit with sophisticated equipment.” “The unit has a comprehensive oxygen supply network, along with C-PAP and Bi-Pap machines, an echocardiography unit and other facilities. We will have specialist doctors at the unit round the clock, along with a team of paramedics who are experienced in critical care. It is a major development in terms of health infrastructure in the district,” added Roy. Pawan Kadyan, the district magistrate, along with Roy and other health officials, inaugurated the unit. Every year, around 200 children with critical problems are referred outside the district for intensive care. In another development, an echocardiography machine was installed at the super-specialty hospital in Jalpaiguri on Thursday. “We have requested the state health department to appoint a cardiologist here so that the machine can be utilised properly,” said a doctor.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-76
24-09-2021||West Bengal||Darjeeling ration dealers seek exemption from Duare Ration||Ration dealers in Darjeeling have sought exemption from “Duare Ration (ration on doorsteps)” in the hills citing high transportation cost owing to terrain and Internet connectivity snags, among others. There are 614 ration shops across Darjeeling hills, including Kalimpong district, of which 111 shops have been brought under Duare Ration launched by the state government recently. “Our dealers are facing various issues given the difficult terrain in the hills. It will be fair and just if the hills are exempt from further carrying on the project,” said Pemba Tamang, president, Darjeeling Gorkha Hill MR Dealers’ Association. Under the Duare Ration scheme, ration dealers have to deliver food items at the beneficiaries’ door. Dealers get a commission of Rs 150 per quintal. “Everything (cost) has to be taken care of from this commission. In reality, our expenditure is at times more than commission,” said a dealer. Dealers not under Duare Ration get a commission of Rs 75 per quintal. The commission rate for both hills and plains is the same, which dealers maintain is unfair given the topography in the hills. Ration dealers maintain in the hills all homes can't be reached by road and often there is no other way apart from carrying load on the head..“Head-load costs us a minimum of Rs 20 for a 50 kg sack (in labour charges),” said another ration dealer. Ration dealers in the hills maintained that apart from transport cost of Rs 3,000 on an average, they have to hire two labourers at Rs 2,000, an electronic point of sale operator at Rs 800 per day, bear loading and unloading charges at Rs 1,200 and provide food for five persons costing Rs 500. The total cost comes to Rs 7,500 per day, they said. The other major problem cited by dealers is erratic Internet connectivity. “Biometric authentication is mandatory for Duare Ration at the point of sale, but owing to network issues, in many places we can’t get the authentication done,” said Tamang. Many dealers also said that many daily wage earners are not at home when they reach. Dealers are expected to segregate beneficiaries in 16 clusters and mark a fixed distribution day in a month from the first Tuesday to the fourth Friday and stick to the days in the upcoming months. “Most daily wage earners and tea garden workers can take ration only during weekends,” said a dealer. Many dealers also complained that at sale points there are no provisions to charge e-POS weighing machines. “The E-POS machine gives a back-up of three hours while weighing machines have a back-up of four to five hours. Even charging these machines is a problem in the hills,” said a dealer. On Tuesday, the association members submitted a memorandum highlighting their grievances to Rajya Sabha MP Shanta Chhetri. Chhetri, has reportedly assured the members to take up the matter with the state government.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-76

These include a meet of homestay owners, an organic “haat” and a ceremony at Siliguri Town station, one of the oldest stations of the region that had been the terminus of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway toy train for decades. “The Covid-19 pandemic had a massive socio-economic impact on tourism. We have designed the events to bolster the confidence of people like homestay owners, popularise organic items and highlight the toy train,” said Raj Basu, ACT convener. According to him, Saturday will see the Homestay Congress at Mainak Tourist Lodge. Former footballer and ACT’s ambassador Bhaichung Bhutia will be present. “He will tell participants on how we are trying to transform his native village (in Sikkim) and some villages in the hills and foothills. The idea is to promote sustainable rural tourism,” said Basu. Experts will also address issues that homestay owners face. On Sunday, the ACT will celebrate “Himalayan Organic Day” with a “haat” on Church Road. “Organic farmers from Siliguri and Sikkim will join the event with their produce. There will be an exhibition of rural handicraft and handloom products of this region, information booths on rural travel and more,” said Sanjukta A. Bose, an ACT member. On World Tourism Day, the ACT will host an event at the old platform of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR) at the Siliguri Town station. “The station needs a revamp. People visiting the region should have the option to visit the station and learn about DHR’s history,” Basu said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-77

24-09-2021||West Bengal||Six migrant workers die as bus plunges into ditch||A bus carrying migrant workers and family members veered off NH12 at Rupahar near here on Wednesday night and plunged into a ditch, killing six men and injuring 30. The private bus was on its way from Jharkhand to Lucknow. Three of the injured are admitted to Raiganj Government Medical College and Hospital, while others were discharged after primary treatment. All the deceased and the injured were from Jharkhand. The bus, police sources said, was on its way to Dalkhola in North Dinajpur from where it was to have entered Purnia in Bihar and headed for Uttar Pradesh. However, when the bus reached near a diversion of the four-lane highway (where the stretch is yet to be four-laned) around 11pm, the driver lost control of the vehicle. The bus bumped off the road and fell into the ditch filled with water. Within minutes, local people came out of homes and started rescuing the passengers. After some time, Raiganj fire station personnel, volunteers of civic defence and disaster management arrived, along with police. A number of passengers were rescued and finally, the bus was pulled out of the ditch around 2am on Thursday. It was then that six men’s bodies were pulled out of the bus. The accident triggered traffic halt for around two hours. Even on Thursday morning, trained divers were engaged to find out whether any passenger was in the ditch. None was found till afternoon. Senior police officers and officials of North Dinajpur district administration have blamed the pathetic condition of NH12 – which is maintained by the National Highways Authority of India for the accident. “The condition of the stretch where the accident occurred is pathetic. We have asked NHAI officials to immediately take up repairs,” district magistrate Arvind Kumar Meena said. Residents of Rupahar have also trained guns at the NHAI. Jagat Sharma, a resident, said the NHAI had not carried out repairs on the stretch where work on a flyover is about to start. “A few months ago, there was flat land on the side of the road but as the highway was widened, earth was dug and used for the  work. As a result, ditches formed and they got filled with water during the monsoon. Had there been land, the number of casualties would have been less,” said Sharma. A bus driver who regularly moves through the route has said the road has a number of such diversions where the stretches are yet to be four-laned. “The curves to the diversions are steep and the signage at each location is not distinct. During night hours, there is every chance that a driver misses the signage,” he said. NHAI officials, however, said they carried out repairs regularly. Dinesh Kumar Hansaria, a project director of the NHAI in Malda, said the top bituminous layer had been damaged because of consistent rainfall. “We have already initiated repairs on the damaged stretches,” he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-77
24-09-2021||West Bengal||Mamata assails Tripura govt over Durga Puja prohibitory order ||Mamata Banerjee has brought up the imposition of prohibitory orders in West Tripura through Durga Puja till Diwali this year to lambast the BJP over its divisive and “false” campaign against her that she was not allowing people to celebrate Hindu festivals in Bengal. The Bengal chief minister touched on the topic in her three public speeches since Wednesday during the campaign for the Bhowanipore bypoll. The Trinamul Congress has alleged the BJP government in Tripura enforced Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) in Agartala and other parts of West Tripura district to prevent political activities by Mamata’s party. The prohibitory orders came in the wake of Trinamul’s plan to take out a road show in Agartala with MP Abhishek Banerjee at the forefront. “Before they (the BJP) come here to seek votes in Bhowanipore, first let’s talk about this…. In Tripura, till Diwali (November 4), you imposed Section 144. So, you imposed Section 144 on Ma Durga? Section 144 on Lakshmi Puja, on Deepavali, on Navratri, on Kali Puja? We will never do this,” Mamata said in Hindi at the Ajanta Restaurant crossing on Thursday evening. The Biplab Deb government had told Tripura High Court earlier this week that the prohibitory orders had been clamped because of apprehensions of a surge in Covid-19 cases and political violence. “We never, ever do these things. How many Pujas do we have here, in Bhowanipore alone? I visit hundreds of Pujas, personally, every year,” she added. In her speeches at Ekbalpore and Chetla too, on Wednesday evening, Mamata had broached the subject. “During elections, they falsely say I don’t allow Durga Puja, Lakshmi Puja, Saraswati Puja and what not…. Countless Pujas take place everywhere in Bengal, every year. It is a global spectacle, a wonder of the world. We don’t impose restrictions, unlike in BJP-ruled states… instead, we help out thousands of organisers,” the chief minister said on Wednesday, referring to the state government’s disbursal of Rs 50,000 each to 36,000 puja committees. Sources in Trinamul said Mamata had been making use of those opportunities to call out the BJP on its “hypocrisy”, with an eye on the 2024 general election. They pointed out how she had repeatedly been underscoring that the Bhowanipore bypoll was much bigger than just a bypoll in a single Assembly constituency. “B for Bhowanipore, B for Bharatvarsh, B for Bharat Mata,” said the chief minister on Thursday. “The khyala (game) from here, will begin in Tripura, in Assam, in Goa, in Uttar Pradesh…. The BJP ought to know by now, that the player who will defeat them has finally arrived,” she had said on Wednesday.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-77
24-09-2021||West Bengal||Calcutta HC asks EC to reply within 24 hours on CM bypoll||The high court on Thursday questioned the manner in which the Election Commission announced its decision to hold the bypoll to the Bhowanipore seat based on a request from the state administration. Following a petition by advocate Sabyasachi Chatterjee, the division bench of Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj asked the EC to file an affidavit within 24 hours stating the law that empowered it to act according to a written request of chief secretary H.K. Dwivedi for this bypoll. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is pitted against the BJP’s Priyanka Tibrewal in the September 30 bypoll. Mamata has to win it to stay as CM. Mamata had lost from Nandigram to the BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari in the Assembly polls. When the petition seeking judicial intervention in alleged irregularities on the part of the EC in declaring bypoll only to the Bhowanipore Assembly constituency came up for hearing on Thursday, the bench questioned why the bypoll date was announced only for Bhowanipore when several other bypolls had been pending for months. Petitioner Chatterjee told the court that the poll panel, while notifying the election dates, had stated that chief secretary Dwivedi, in a written request to the EC, stated that the state would face a constitutional crisis if the bypoll in Bhowanipore was not held within six months of the last Assembly polls as the chief minister had expressed her desire to contest from the constituency. “The para 7 of the notification said that on the basis of chief secretary’s request it (the commission) had decided to hold the bypoll in Bhowanipore on September 30," Chatterjee added. The petition was moved a week ago when the bench had adjourned the hearing of the case asking the lawyer why it took him days to approach the court after the poll panel issued its notification. Against this backdrop, the court’s directive to the poll panel to file its affidavit within 24 hours surprised the legal circles. However, Opposition parties in Bengal had been raising questions right after the Bhowanipore bypoll date was announced by the commission. When contacted, senior advocate and CPM MP Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, who argued the case on behalf of the petitioner, said: “The other vital point that I have referred is that such a notification might influence people in casting vote in favour of Trinamul Congress candidate as they would feel that a constitutional crisis would be created if they do not vote for the chief minister.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-77

Haque was a five-time Farakka MLA and the Congress’s in-charge for Jharkhand. Haque accepted the Trinamul flag from Banerjee, as did nearly 200 other Congress workers from Murshidabad, which was once considered as an impregnable fortress of the Congress. “Congress block presidents and leaders of various wings from Farakka joined Trinamul,” said a source. Haque’s switch to Trinamul came after he had submitted a letter dated Tuesday stating that he was resigning from all posts and portfolios in the Congress. After the induction ceremony on Thursday, Haque was seen alongside Banerjee in the campaign for Trinamul nominee Amirul Islam at the Samserganj football grounds. “Trinamul is a party of its word.

24-09-2021||West Bengal||District overhaul awaits BJP in Bengal||The Assembly poll setback has taken the Bengal BJP back to the drawing board as the state leadership is eyeing a structural overhaul of the organisation. A three-member committee set up by BJP joint general secretary (organisation) Shivprakash, who looks after the party’s affairs in Bengal, has prepared a list of organisational districts that it wishes to delimit. “This is a complete organisational restructuring. We need to shrink the size of many districts where we are weak. It is easier to concentrate on smaller units,” a state BJP functionary said. “The list has been prepared accordingly,” this person added. While Bengal has 23 administrative districts, for the BJP, the state is divided into 39 organisational districts. Although the new rejig will not bring about much change in the number, several districts will shrink in size while others will expand, party sources said. One of the internal analyses of the poll debacle, done by the party, has shown BJP leaders that while the party’s organisation is strong in all districts of north Bengal and some districts in the west, it is still quite weak in the south. On the basis of this report, Shivprakash had asked state BJP vice-presidents Biswapriyo Roy Chowdhury, Ritesh Tiwari and Raju Banerjee to look into the matter and a prospective delimitation. “The number of districts will mostly remain unchanged. The proposal is to break away parts of an existing weak district and join them in a district that looks organisationally stronger,” another BJP source said. Brawl Bengal BJP president and Balurghat MP Sukanta Majumdar got involved in a brawl with Calcutta police near chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s residence on Thursday. Majumdar and a few other BJP leaders, including the party’s Bhowanipore bypoll candidate Priyanka Tibrewal, were leading a convoy of cars carrying the corpse of Dhurjati Saha. Saha, a BJP candidate in the summer polls, had allegedly been beaten up by Trinamul goons on May 2. He passed away on Wednesday. On their way to the crematorium, Majumdar got out of his car and sat on the crossing near Mamata’s home. The police immediately removed him. The area is under Section 144. Majumdar later said he would ask Tibrewal, who is a lawyer, to file a case against the police for harassing women members of the BJP.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-77
24-09-2021||North East||Assam shootout: BJP puts blame on Islamic outfit PFI||The BJP on Friday alleged that "third party political and apolitical forces" including Islamist outfit Popular Front of India (PFI) could be behind instigating protesters to attack Assam Police personnel during an eviction drive in Darrang district. Two persons were killed and 20 others injured in clashes between police and alleged encroachers during an eviction drive in Gorukhuti and other villages under Sipajhar revenue circle on Thursday. "At Gorukhuti, we have observed a pattern similar to the PFI's way of functioning. The outfit aims to only create unrest," local BJP MP Dilip Saikia told reporters. The Islamist organisation has been banned in several states and the Centre is also in the process of making it a proscribed outfit. He said that other "political and apolitical organisations" could also be behind the incident and the facts will gradually be unravelled during investigation. BJP state chief Bhabesh Kalita claimed that there was a "pre-planned move" to gather people from outside and attack the police. "Doubtful citizens are being evicted and the BJP is fully behind the state government's drive," he added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-4
24-09-2021||North East||Assam: Two killed in police firing during eviction drive||At least two people were killed in police firing in Assam’s Darrang on Thursday during an operation to evict alleged encroachers in a minority-dominated settlement. A macabre element was injected when purported footage from the locality showed a photographer hired by the district administration stomping on and punching a wounded man moments before he became motionless. The video, the content of which had not been disputed till late on Thursday night, showed uniformed personnel opening fire repeatedly and in quick succession. The man, wielding what looks like a stick and chasing the police, runs into a posse of uniformed men. Shots ring out, the man slumps, many uniformed men close in on him and rain blows with batons. When the police disperse, the man can be seen lying on the ground. The photographer, who is at the centre of the posse, turns back, jumps and appears to land on the left side of the man, who throws up or flails his left arm momentarily. A policeman lands another lathi blow on the man. The photographer then appears to knee the man near his face and starts walking, only to turn around and slam his fist into the man. The video camera zooms in on the motionless man, on whose vest a red stain can be seen spreading from his chest. The photographer is again seen jumping and this time clearly landing on the left arm of the man. The photographer punches the man. The police then lead the photographer away from the motionless man. Bijay Shankar Baniya, a professional photographer hired by the district administration to document the situa¬tion, was arrested later. Darrang superintendent of police Sushanta Biswa Sarma, younger brother of chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, said the protesters, armed with sharp weapons, had pelted the police and others with stones. The police said they had initially fired in the air to disperse the protesters but failed, thereby being forced to fire at the crowd, killing two and injuring at least 10. Around 10 others, including policemen, too were injured in the clashes. The dead have been identified as Saddam Hussain and Sheikh Forid. The injured include eight policemen. Assistant subinspector Moniruddin has been admitted to the Gauhati Medical College Hospital in a critical condition. The eviction operation is part of the BJP government’s move to free 77,000 bighas from encroachers at Sipajhar in Darrang district on the northern banks of the Brahmaputra and set up an agriculture project involving youths from the indigenous communities. The residents, who claim they have been living there since the 1970s, were served notices on Saturday and the ongoing drive was launched on Monday, freeing 4,500 bighas from about 800 families. Four places of worship were also demolished, the residents said. The eviction, along with the allotment of the freed land to the landless among the indigenous communities, was one of the key poll planks of the BJPled alliance. Chief minister Sarma had visited the affected area in June and promised to evict the “encroachers” and set up the agriculture project. There was no resistance on Monday but on Thursday, the affected people demanded rehabilitation and adequate time to move out because of the ongoing pandemic, sources said. Thursday’s police firing drew condemnation from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who called the action “statesponsored fire”. The Assam government has ordered a probe by a retired judge into the police firing. Chief minister Sarma said the eviction drive would not stop. “The police have been entrusted with the responsibility of clearing the land from encroachers and they will continue to do it till the job is done. Eviction will stop once it is dark and resume tomorrow,” he said on Thursday evening.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-4
24-09-2021||Opinion||Editorial: Hardest hit||Women have been hit hardest by the pandemic. On the one hand, the female labour participation rate in India fell to 16.1 per cent in 2020, the lowest among major economies. On the other hand, there was a rise of about 50 per cent in cases of child marriage the same year, according to data released by the National Crime Records Bureau. There is, of course, a causal relationship between deteriorating economic conditions and early marriage. Economically distressed parents often marry off girl children — younger brides require smaller dowries or command higher bride prices — to escape the financial burden of caring. The closure of schools has also left young girls extremely vulnerable. The fact that West Bengal had the third highest number of child marriage cases shows that even welfare schemes that have had some success, such as the Kanyashree Prakalpa, need to be reimagined. Reports show that the scheme has, ironically, become tangled in the marriage economy of rural Bengal with the money provided for funding education being used to pay dowry. The spike in child marriages has, expectedly, corresponded with a worrying rise in infant and maternal mortality rates and child malnutrition: both have risen in Bengal. Underage, undernourished mothers are in no position to give birth to healthy children, perpetuating a vicious cycle of deprivation. The numbers speak for themselves. But governments seldom want to hear the harsh truth. Last year, the Union minister for women and child development had told Parliament that “there is no data to indicate rising number of child marriage cases during the lockdown”. Such ignorance — subterfuge? — is likely to make a bad situation worse. This month, the Rajasthan government passed an amendment to reduce the age of registration of marriage for women who had been married off as children. The second case exposes a lacuna in the law prohibiting child marriage. The law holds that a marriage between two underage individuals is ‘voidable’ — that is, it can be annulled — only if one of the contracting parties files a case at the district court. The entrenched social acceptability of child marriages means that thousands of cases go unreported. The bigger problem, however, lies in viewing child marriage merely as an inequitable tradition. Child marriage is also — in as many as 50 per cent of the cases, according to some estimates — a medium for trafficking women, often by family members. What chance do young girls have in a system that is rigged entirely against women?||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-29
24-09-2021||Opinion||Letters to the editor: Calcutta turns into city of floods||Troubled waters Sir — The city of joy, Calcutta, seems to have turned into the city of floods. During my childhood, it was widely known that some parts of the city, lower than the rest, were prone to water-logging, causing distress to the residents of those areas — Thanthania Kalibari and its adjoining areas, parts of South Calcutta and neighbourhoods near the Hooghly river are some examples. With the gradual increase of population and careless development activities over the years, the list has only grown longer. Waterlogging is common in other big cities like Mumbai and Hyderabad. One cannot control the rains, but what one can surely do is build infrastructure and ensure proper drainage of water through a robust underground sewerage system. But successive governments and the municipal corporation in Bengal have done little to tackle this problem. The Left Front failed to adequately utilize the Asian Development Bank’s loans for de-siltation and the renovation of the city’s sewers. The incumbent Trinamul Congress government, too, seems indifferent to this issue — it appears to have no concrete policy on this matter. The government is only interested in securing votes; that is why its efforts remain confined to populist tactics like Duare Sarkar, Duare Ration and other such initiatives. Ultimately, the common people of Calcutta are the victims. Every monsoon, they have to navigate knee-deep water even days after the spells of heavy rain stop. This time, too, when the entire city was half submerged, with no sign of the water receding, many of the state’s lawmakers were busy campaigning for the re-election of the chief minister in the upcoming bypolls. These lawmakers should remember that they are, above all, public servants. Swapan Kumar Raha,Calcutta Sir — Bagherghole, on Boral Main Road under the Rajpur-Sonarpur municipality, gets waterlogged for days at a stretch after every shower. Water from the drains mixes with the accumulated rainwater, raising the risk of skin infections in people who have to navigate this area on foot, bicycle or motorcycle. Daily commuters regularly face harassment since the auto-rickshaw services along the Bagherghole-Garia route is affected. The careless disposal of plastic carry bags and vegetable residues from the local market often end up blocking the drains. Needless to say, these drains are seldom cleaned and solid waste management is as good as absent. This also hampers the livelihoods of shopkeepers and local vendors, who are unable to continue business because of waterlogging. Regular waterlogging also damages the roads. An effective and time-bound intervention from the Rajpur-Sonarpur municipality and the local member of the legislative assembly is the need of the hour. Joydeep Saha,Calcutta Sir — Images of waterlogging in Calcutta and the suburbs make us shudder and shake our heads in dismay. The government and the civic authorities, of course, have standard responses — they blame the overwhelming intensity of rainfall. What often remains in the shadows is that the height of many important roads and highways has been raised considerably over the last two decades, possibly as a mark of ‘development’, without taking into account the fact that the adjoining or feeder roads consequently become relatively low-lying. The accumulated water, therefore, flows out onto the low-level roads. The residential houses and hospitals in such areas — Mukundapur, for instance — suffer as a result. It is our misfortune that we have such short-sighted, thoughtless planners and politicians. Suman Sankar Dasgupta,Calcutta Sir — As if waterlogging itself were not enough trouble, commuters are further harassed by surging taxi fares during monsoon. I had to pay Rs 1,500 for an urgent ride — even after the rains had abated — which would have cost me less than Rs 500 on a normal day. The mess of overhead electric wires in the city also poses a serious threat to the public during heavy rains. Loose wires and large pools of accumulated water make for a deadly combination. The government needs to plan ahead in order to prevent such problems. Madhuri Sarkhel,Calcutta Sir — Waterlogging has become a chronic affair in Calcutta and its suburbs. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has laid new sewage lines in several areas of the city. But much more remains to be done. This mammoth problem needs to be tackled on a war footing. Murtaza Ahmad,Calcutta  By the horns Sir — Poaching has been a persistent problem in India, but the Assam government has shown its willingness to grab the proverbial bull by the horns. On World Rhino Day, it destroyed nearly 2,500 horns of one-horned rhinoceros seized from poachers by burning them publicly. The goal was to dispel the myth that rhinoceros horns have miraculous medicinal properties or significant health benefits. While the symbolism of the action is appreciated, more concrete measures are required to curb the menace of poaching, which reportedly doubled during the periods of lockdown.

24-09-2021||Opinion||Editorial: Clinching proof||Sudden demographic imbalances among religious communities in a heterogeneous society can lead to social and political tensions. The conclusion of a report by the Pew Research Center that the populations of India’s principal religious groups have remained stable since Partition must, therefore, come as a source of relief for planners and conscientious citizens. The study — it drew its data from the decennial census and the National Family Health Survey — found that there has been a marked decline, as well as near-convergence, in the fertility rates of Hindus and Muslims. The latter — the community may have had the highest fertility rate but — had experienced the sharpest drop; between 1992 and 2015, their fertility rate dropped to 2.6 from 4.4. The corresponding figure for Hindus was a decline from 3.3 to 2.1. Two other, equally significant, inferences have been drawn by the study. First, it found that religious conversion has had no impact on the composition of India’s population. Second, it argues that there is no concrete evidence of undocumented migrants flooding India because of the absence of signs of outmigration from neighbouring nations. The report, which complements an earlier study published in June, would be useful to demographers and policymakers to frame future interventions. This is because India’s average fertility rate — at 2.2 — remains higher than those of advanced economies. The obvious thrusts should be on literacy and public awareness. The 2011 census had revealed that the literacy rate among Muslims was a little lower than 70 per cent. Investments must be made to raise this and improve standards of education among minority communities. That would facilitate greater awareness about the perils of the burden of having a large family and give women greater autonomy in decision-making. Another important takeaway is the dismantling of the false rhetoric concerning the surge in Muslim population or, say, the influx of migrants into India. The data demonstrate that the toxic narratives concerning India’s largest minority community have been created by the ruling party without any real empirical evidence. Yet, the Bharatiya Janata Party has succeeded in disseminating such spurious information precisely because of the ineptitude — unwillingness — of the Opposition to challenge this narrative with facts and findings from credible institutions and agencies. Data, experts have opined, are very much the new oil. Why, then, should they not be used as fuel by political parties to battle the demonization of minorities?||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-30
24-09-2021||Opinion||Real diversity||In his book, Culture and Imperialism, Edward Said said, “culture is not monolithic... and is not the exclusive property of the East or West nor of the small groups of men and women”. This means one ethnic or cultural group cannot dominate another. Historically, there have been attempts to create ‘oneness’ out of multicultural diversity. If culture is diverse by definition, why, then, do we need to pay special attention to diversity and inclusion? Should it not organically be assimilated in our population? The objective of initiatives such as reservation is to enhance the representation of groups which are usually invisible. It is not just about economic benefits. Diverse groups have been subjected to oppression, injustice, and exploitation. Affirmative action is, thus, one way to approach the chronic issue of inequity. From an economic perspective, which is what businesses are usually bothered about, diversity leads to innovative practices. Only a diverse group would know how to approach an issue in unconventional ways. Hence, diversity matters — more than ever. In any conversation on diversity, gender is globally celebrated, and rightly so. These days, this has been extended to sexuality. This is why brands suddenly turn rainbow in June, Pride Month. But beyond these optics, are anti-reservationist actions and thoughts, which is a result of years of socialization and upbringing. Reservation is described as anti-merit. But merit is the outcome of privilege, which is often not connected to economics, but social capital or ‘network’ in business terminology. Over and above financial capital, social capital pushes one to believe that caste-based discrimination no longer exists. This is far from true. Social capital may even unknowingly become an unwritten reservation for the upper castes. Despite visible and quantifiable instances of caste-based atrocities, private companies actively choose not to approach caste-based affirmation as part of their diversity and inclusion initiatives. In fact, gender and sexuality have come to be a safe bet for private companies because such initiatives resonate with dominant caste groups, who are the decision-makers. According to a 2019 study published in the Pacific-Basin Finance Journal on the composition of Indian boards, more than 94 per cent of corporate leadership and board appointments are from the upper castes. Further, a research exposé led by S.S. Jodhka highlighted how caste plays an important role in recruitment and entrepreneurship wherein candidates from Dalit and Muslim backgrounds are systematically ignored. Similarly, a 2018 study published in the Strategic Management Journal proves that caste/family names along with their extended networks play a significant role in CEO selection. In spite of the United Progressive Alliance government setting up a committee in 2006 for “affirmative action for SC/ST communities” to improve representation of the marginalized in the private sector, nothing substantial has happened. Of the 17,788 member companies, only 19 per cent adopted the code of conduct. Ironically, there is more vocational training and scholarships for the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes than employment opportunities. This is not surprising as most executives are socially trained to ignore caste-based diversity. The deliberate exclusion of marginalized castes in the private sector has fulfilled the social and economic aspirations of the upper castes. This is what passes as merit. While social media has given the issue of diversity some visibility, attempts to protect privilege have seen gender become the most agreed upon D&I initiative globally. Caste has thus been invisiblized yet again. The idea that recipients of affirmative action are being given a free run is completely untrue. Each individual has to face the same rigorous structure of learning and pass the same exams. As teachers we can educate under-represented groups so that they can eventually build social capital. Education is the only tool through which discrimination and injustice can be eradicated. It is time we look beyond gender-based diversity and make the workplace and educational institutes more equitable.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-30
24-09-2021||Opinion||Rethinking ethics||The Covid-19 epidemic has become a historical event, which we greet with awe. It has entered the global imagination as an act of crisis. Yet, at another level, Covid pretends a return to routine. The idea of the normal has acquired a sacred, official quality. We read ‘normalization’ as the role of governance. Yet, this idea of the normal is instrumental and lacks a moral imagination. A wise friend of mine reminded me that the two silences of the Covid era are the lack of a literary imagination and the absence of an ethical presence. The silence of ethics has been deafening, both in policy and in science. One must realize that ethics is not merely a question of right and wrong; it is a way, a set of metaphors, for reading an event. The epidemic speaks the language of cost-benefit without articulating a sense of suffering. Despite the eerie demography of deaths, Covid provided no sense of mourning. In fact, in creating an Olympiad of body counts, it facilitated the language of triage and dispensability. In India, we treated the informal economy as disposable. Worse, science spoke in the spirit of exponential loss but had no sense of suffering, of care, of compassion. Ethics was the main casualty of the Covid crisis. The question before civil society is how do we retrieve a sense of ethics. Our inability to make policy remember memory and the failure of memory and mourning mark the flaws of Covid policy. Yet, the old-fashioned ethics of earlier decades will not do. During the national movement, we linked character-building to nation-building. Goodness was individualized in terms of personal roles. Most autobiographies, from the work of the chemist, P.C. Ray to Gandhi’s experiments with truth, were ethical narratives. What we need to add to it is an institutional and cosmic ethics. One realizes that corruption and evil are becoming innovative. Mere goodness becomes reduced to a form of correctness, an etiquette, a form of life that gets eliminated quickly. One sees this in the hard realism of a Bollywood movie where the good cop or the good father or the vulnerable teacher is dispatched before the interval. The battle of good and evil needs a different kind of goodness, a goodness based on an innovative and experimental ethics. Let me begin by citing two brilliant examples of a search for a new ethics. In the last few years, there has been a spate of books on trees. One thinks of Suzanne Simard’s Finding the Mother Tree, Peter Wohlleben’s The Hidden Life of Trees or even Richard Powers’s Pulitzer-prize-winning The Overstory. All these books talk of trees in a different way. The old idea of forestry was an insult to the forest as an idea. Forestry was constructed more as a law-and-order model of quick growth and productivity. Yet Simard shows that the forest is a mode of thought, of communication, of symbiosis, of trusteeship. A tree is no longer timber and paper. It is a way of life. A gift to the living. It is an act of generosity. A dead tree transfers its nutrients to neighbouring trees before it dies. Trees warn one other about beetle invasions. A tree, literally, is a system of trusteeship and reciprocity. There is no such thing as a tree that is a statement of illiteracy and individuality. A tree is a commons. Simard shows that the idea of productivity, which we treat in hallowed terms, is instrumental, short-sighted. A tree is an act of cooperation. A science which sees trees as a lesser order of being is illiterate. Ecolacy has to be a part of ethics and science. We have to relate to nature in a different way. What is true for the tree is true for the earth. We need an earth ethics which tribes produced in sophisticated myths. We need an ethics of nature that mimics its generosity, its reciprocity, its celebration of difference. We need to immortalize the ethics of a tree as part of our constitutional ethics. We need myths and cosmologies, which are more life-giving than rights in a contractual sense. Ethically a tree, like any form of life, is a sacrament. To the ethics of nature, we need to add an ethics of the body, the music of a sensorium, which will create an ethics of memory. In this age of obsolescence and genocide, we need an ethics of memory. Covid showed that we lack an ethics of memory. We had information as impersonal bytes but memory as the music of sharing is missing. Today, we need to create a wall of mourning for every species and language lost. This brings me to my second story. This story occurred in a little town called Chirala, a weaving town close to Hyderabad. It was host to an international seminar between historians of science and weavers. On the first day, the seminar followed the predictable distancing but on the third day everyone sat on the floor. The workers also brought their looms to explain. This created a dialogicity that was different from the usual hierarchy of seminars. In this gift of conversation, one of the activists told the historian that you have stolen both our livelihood and our theory. He said that we have to reclaim our theories of knowledge to reclaim the forms of life we are losing. The taken-for-grantedness of obsolescence has to be challenged by a new ethics of memory and cognitive justice. We need to create a new ethics of diversity to challenge the linearity, the monoculture, that obsolescence is anchored on. We need a new experimental ethics. It is only civil society that can create this new dialogic ethics, an ethics that looks at different sciences, theologies, languages, to create life-giving sensibility. Gandhi had a sensibility about it. He talked of accounting (money), accountability (honesty), responsibility, trusteeship and sacrifice. Ethics has to embrace all and go beyond cost-benefit within this world. Saving a weed, a fungus, a marginal group is a creative form of ethics. We go beyond the language of monocultural efficiency and show that an ethics of diversity is far more progressive than the Darwinian idea of the survival of the fittest. This search for a life-giving ethics has to be panarchic, different at different levels of life. One needs to alter the desiccated norms of professional ethics. The feminist reading of the body and nature should educate scientific ethics. It needs to be more than a collector of table manners. The university must create a new realm of cognitive ethics, new debates — about violence, suffering and the consequences of knowledge. This cannot be left to technocratic experts. One needs the marginal, the housewife, the victim, the minority, to talk about their apprehensions as well as their stories. Their fears embody the cognitive understandings we have to bring into science. We need a perspective which is both aesthetic and ethical. For example, every school could be responsible for saving a lost language or a dying craft. The Kasturirangan Committee report is a dead end in terms of ethics. Finally, literature has to create a new language, a poetics of ethics, to challenge the idioms of progress. It has to capture the exemplar and the dissenter challenging power. Ethics, in this sense, becomes both resistance and innovation, adding to the life-giving diversity of democracy.

24-09-2021||Jharkhand||Deoghar sets sights on GI tag for its famed 'peda'||As for the peda, the most favoured sweet offering for the gods, Mathura has stolen a march over other holy sites by getting its own GI tagged. Now, Deoghar, home to the Baba Baidyanath Dham, is eyeing a similar recognition which, the local administration hopes, will not just give its pedas global recognition but will also lead to a boom in the businesses of peda making. On Friday, Deoghar deputy commissioner Manjunath Bhajantri said that he had asked all peda makers of the district to register themselves with the industries department by September 30. After that he would move a formal application with the appropriate authority for GI tagging the Deoghar peda. GI tag defines the region of origin of a particular food, agricultural or industrial product. It  is given under the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999. And it is provided by the Geographical Indications Registry headquartered in Chennai. Bhajantri said that he had held a couple of meetings with peda makers of the district to apprise them of the benefits of a GI tag. “We are also conducting awareness campaigns so that more and more traders get themselves registered,” he said, adding that after GI tag, Deoghar pedas can get a national and international clientele. Sellers, he said, can sell them round-the-year using online modes and  food aggregators. Mukhyamantri Laghu Evam Kutir Udyam Vikas Board, an arm of the state industries department which has been created exclusively to work for the upliftment and betterment of small and cottage industries, is also holding awareness sessions with peda makers to motivate them to register themselves with the district industries department. District coordinator Niraj Kumar said that so far, 10 peda makers had registered themselves. He was sure more would follow soon. “Deoghar and Ghumara in Deoghar district are the two places that are considered as the hub of peda makers. There are about 200 traders who have been in the  business for generations. We are trying to motivate maximum traders before moving a formal application to the GI certification agency,” he said. Kumar's said that once the registration window for local traders was closed, they would form a society. “Only those who are part of that society will be able to use the GI logo after the approval,” he said. The entire process of getting GI registration takes about two-three months after submission of an application. In Jharkhand, the traditional Sohrai-Khovar art form of  Hazaribagh was the first to receive a GI tag in May last year. This particular art form showcases the use of earth colours, mainly by adivasi women,  to decorate their homes. Over the years, it has also been used as wall paintings comprising lines, dots, animals and plants. Khovar depicts a nuptial chamber decorated to bless a newly married couple. In tribal culture, Sohrai is celebrated as a  festivals (cattle festival) which coincides with Diwali.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-38

24-09-2021||Jharkhand||Two weather systems brewing, expect the east to be swamped next week ||Eastern India, primarily Bengal, Odisha and the Bihar-Jharkhand belt, is expected to experience a vigourous monsoon in the next couple of days with the Met office pointing to two back-to-back low pressure systems brewing in the Bay of Bengal. Weather officials said on Friday that the monsoon was likely to remain active till early October. Of the two systems, one will start impacting Bhubaneswar and other places in Odisha from Sunday (September 26), while the other is expected to follow two-three days later and trigger rainfall across cities and towns of Jharkhand and Bengal like Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Calcutta. This system is also likely to impact the weather of Bihar as it moves northwards. "Today's (Friday's) air-chart analysis and other weather models suggest that under the influence of a cyclonic circulation, a low-pressure area has formed over east central Bay of Bengal which is likely to move north-west  towards the Odisha coast during the next 48 hours. This will impact the weather of Odisha, Bengal and Jharkhand," said anIMD official in New Delhi. Officials at IMD's Ranchi Met Centre said the back-to-back weather systems would prolong monsoon's stay in the eastern region states of Jharkhand, Bengal, Odisha and Bihar. Weather officials at IMD's Regional Met Centre at Alipore in Calcutta said the normal date for the monsson to start retreating (from west Rajasthan) was September 17 with the season ending on September 30. "But the prevailing situation suggests that this year’s monsoon withdrawal is likely to be delayed by more than two weeks," said an official at the Calcutta Met Centre. He went on to add that the two back-to-back systems were expected to bring more rain to the central and eastern regions, delaying the retreat of the monsoon. Met statistics revealed that if the two low-pressure circulations hit the mainland as forecast, September would have had five such systems, the highest for any monsoon month this year. July saw four low-pressure systems bringing rain from the Bay of Bengal, while June and August experienced two such systems each. Satellite pictures suggested that the monsoon trough at mean sea level was passing through Daltonganj, Jamshedpur (Jharkhand) and Digha (Bengal) on Friday and was extending till East Central Bay of Bengal.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-38
24-09-2021||Jharkhand||Hemant Soren re-launches Sona Sobran Dhoti Saree Lungi Scheme||Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren on Wednesday re-launched an old government scheme named after his grandfather Sona Sobran to provide dhotis, saris and lungis at Rs 10 to poor families in the state. The scheme was launched in 2014 when Soren was the chief minister for a brief tenure but was discontinued by the Raghubar Das-led BJP government in 2015. “The scheme has been named Sona Sobran Dhoti Saree Lungi Scheme and will cover nearly 58 lakh below poverty line ration card holder beneficiaries across Jharkhand. The government has sanctioned Rs 500 crore for this scheme. Beneficiaries will receive dhoti, saris and lungis twice a year for Rs 10 from ration shops along with food grains,” Soren told the gathering at the function in Dumka after laying foundation stones of projects worth over Rs 230 crore and inaugurated 18 projects worth over Rs 37.92 crore. Soren stressed that after managing to curb Covid cases, the government is now going full throttle on initiating development schemes. “For over a year the entire world has been battling the Covid pandemic and a state like Jharkhand with limited resources has managed to cope with the crisis through better management and cooperation of masses. However, we need to be cautious as we continue the unlock process and march towards normalising life. The government will go all out to initiate development schemes and create job opportunities and fulfil the promises made to the masses. We have made our intention clear by conducting the Jharkhand Public Service Commission exams recently, which was held after a span of more than five years, and will open gates of employment. We would also like youths to seek employment in other sectors too like animal husbandry, pisciculture and poultry,” he said. He announced that the government will soon open English-medium schools of excellence in all the districts which will be functional from next academic session along with Hindi schools and also promote sports infrastructure at the block level to nurture and promote sporting talent. Soren also encouraged tribal and Scheduled Caste entrepreneurs to set up industries. “We have launched the new industrial policy with a slew of incentives for tribal and Scheduled Caste industrialists and would like them to avail benefits,” said Soren. The chief minister also advised officials to arrange an awareness campaign about government welfare schemes at the village level so that people can avail their benefits. Earlier, finance minister Rameshwar Oraon, who also holds the portfolio of public food supplies, said that the financial condition was not good due to the central government’s step-motherly treatment by deducting pending dues of the Damodar Valley Corporation from Jharkhand’s account but not making any efforts to clear the pending amount owed by public sector units to the state government. “Despite such constraints, we are committed to fulfil our poll promises and the initiation of this scheme is a part of this effort,” said Oraon. The function was also attended by JMM supremo and Rajya Sabha MP Shibu Soren.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-39
24-09-2021||Jharkhand||Envoy Nick Low praises Ranchi UK grant for tribal students||British deputy high commissioner Nick Low on Thursday praised the initiative of the Jharkhand government to provide scholarship to tribal students for higher studies in the UK. In a letter to chief minister Hemant Soren, Low congratulated him for successfully rolling out the Marang Gomke Jaipal Singh Munda Overseas Scholarship Scheme and helping students from tribal communities go abroad to pursue higher studies and expressed sadness for not being able to attend the felicitation. “I have the honour to write this letter with both joy and sadness in my heart. Joy because I am truly delighted to convey my heartiest thanks and congratulations to the government of Jharkhand for launching the Marang Gomke Jaipal Singh Munda Overseas Scholarship Scheme for students belonging to tribal communities to pursue higher education in the United Kingdom. Sadness because I am unable to rearrange my programme to join you for this afternoon’s event,” the letter states. Praising the state government’s visionary initiative for supporting marginal communities, Low said: “In the direction of bridging the inequalities of access in higher studies, I sincerely congratulate you for steering this visionary initiative to bridge the inequalities of access to higher education faced by marginal communities in India. “Your leadership and the efforts of the state government of Jharkhand to drive this knowledge partnership between Jharkhand and the United Kingdom deserve the highest praise. The legacy of Jaipal Singh Munda, who started his Oxford BA programme a century ago will, I believe, now be taken forward both through this batch of scholars and subsequent beneficiaries.” Welcoming the first batch of students to the UK universities, Low said: “It gives me immense pleasure also to welcome the inaugural cohort of six scholars selected to follow masters programmes in prestigious universities across the United Kingdom.” On Thursday, the chief minister and tribal welfare minister Champai Soren felicitated the students selected for the scholarship and their parents at a programme in Ranchi. The scholarship scheme has been rolled out for Scheduled Tribe students to pursue higher studies in universities across the UK. The awardees are entitled to a complete cover of tuition fees along with living and other miscellaneous expenses. Under this scheme, 10 ST students will be selected every year in Jharkhand. Addressing the students, Soren said that a budget provision of Rs 10 crore has been made for higher education abroad. He urged the department to adjust the budgeted amount left in the next financial year so that more and more students can get the opportunity of quality education abroad. He also announced that efforts are on to increase the number of students to be selected for the scholarship in future. The chief minister said since this scheme is giving opportunities to the students of tribal communities for higher education abroad, the government will also consider in the near future about giving a similar chance to children from other communities as well. Among the selected students, Hercules Singh Munda is going to pursue an MA at the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies, while Ajitesh Murmu is going to study for an MA in Architecture at the University College of London. Akanksha Mary Balmuchu has been selected for an MSc in climate change science and management at the Loughborough University, while Dinesh Bhagat will pursue an MSc in climate change, development and policy at the University of Sussex. Apart from this, Anjana Pratima Dungdung has been selected for an MSc at the University of Warwick and Priya Murmu will pursue an MA in creative writing and the writing industries at the Loughborough University.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-39
