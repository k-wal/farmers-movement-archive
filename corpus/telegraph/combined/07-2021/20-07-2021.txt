20-07-2021||Calcutta||Visiting PSU banks a nightmare for elderly customers||A visit to a nationalised bank has become a nightmare for many customers, especially senior citizens, in the wake of the Covid curbs and a series of mergers. Thousands of elderly people — often with the simplest of business — are being made to wait for a long time in queues outside banks. On many occasions, only to be turned away from the gate. Ironically, the social distancing protocols are going for a toss in the queues. Many people, who just have a simple query or have come to collect a form, are not ready to wait for a long time and are jostling with others to get inside. The Telegraph has reported about similar queues outside banks in September last year. In a year threatened by disease and other constraints, trips to banks have become a necessity for many elders because issues that can be solved in one day are dragging on for an indefinite period. ⚫ Last week, an octogenarian waited close to an hour in a queue outside a nationalised bank on the northern fringes of Calcutta so he could get a new passbook. When his turn came, a man at the gate asked for the passbook and told the senior citizen the bank would call him when it was available. When the senior citizen asked for the person’s identity or phone number for future reference, he was told: “Please take your passbook and go home. You don’t have to get an update.” ⚫ On Monday afternoon, a 60-year-old man had to wait in a queue for close to 75 minutes outside another nationalised bank in Bansdroni. All Ashis Mukherjee had to do — give his permission to renew a recurring deposit after maturity. Till now, the deposit was auto-renewed on maturity but not any more because of a “system change”, he was told. ⚫ An 83-year-old woman waited for close to 40 minutes outside a nationalised bank in New Alipore. The bank has been recently merged with another bank. The woman had got a message saying that the old IFSC (Indian Financial System Code, needed to transfer funds online) had changed. “I could not understand whether the message was an intimation or a prod to visit the branch and get a new chequebook. I thought it was best that I visited the branch,” said Purnima Banerjee, a retired teacher. The Centre has amalgamated 10 public sector banks into four entities. Allahabad Bank and the United Bank of India — both used to be headquartered in Calcutta — have been merged with Indian Bank and Punjab National Bank, respectively. Across the city, thousands of customers of these two banks are going through a torrid time. A 72-year-old Behala resident, a customer of the erstwhile United Bank of India, received a message saying that she would be getting a new cheque book with a new MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition technology, printed on cheques for faster identification of a bank and branch during electronic clearing of cheques) code. But the message also said she would have to get the cheque book “activated” through the branch. The woman, a former employee of a PSU bank, went to the branch last week but was told to visit “after seven days”. “The whole idea of sending a cheque book to my home is to reduce the need for going to the bank. What is the point in going to the bank twice to use my own cheque book,” asked the woman. The branches with a large base of depositors had bigger queues. The Bansdroni branch of a PSU bank had over 50 people waiting in a queue around noon on Monday. The sun was blazing, the mercury had touched 34 degrees, the RealFeel was 44 degrees and the humidity was close to 65 degrees. One of the people waiting in the queue was Prabir Barik, 65. He has a fixed deposit with the branch. But there was an error in the spelling of the name of the nominee for the deposit. “I came last month. I was told to come after a month. Here I am today, standing in the queue for over an hour but yet unsure if I will be able to get the work done,” said Barik. A helpdesk that was supposed to sort customers according to their needs at the gate was not seen at any of the 20-odd branches this newspaper visited on Monday. A branch manager of a PSU bank in south Calcutta said the social distancing norms were being implemented according to the capacity of each branch. “A 3,000sq ft branch with 15 employees and eight counters can allow 12 to 15 people at a time. A 1,000sq ft branch with three counters cannot allow, say, more than three to six people at a time,” said the official. Many banks have been providing “limited services” — mainly cash deposit, withdrawal and implementation of government schemes — citing lack of personnel because of Covid. A senior member of the State Level Bankers Committee in Bengal, which coordinates between the government and the banks, attributed the staff shortage to lack of transport options. “Local trains are suspended. Buses and taxis are also limited. Many people who stay far away from the branches cannot come to work every day,” he said. A senior official of a PSU bank in Calcutta said it was unfortunate that people still had to wait hours for ancillary services like collection of forms and updation of KYC details. “Leave aside digitisation and doorstep banking, there is no operational helpline for customers in most cases,” he said.

20-07-2021||Calcutta||Online platform launched to help candidates prepare for competitive exams ||An online platform to help candidates prepare for competitive exams was launched on Friday. RICE Education, which prepares students for recruitment tests for government jobs, will now offer online courses for exams conducted by the public service commission, staff selection commission, railways and banks through an app called RICE Smart. The course is a combination of online classes, pre-recorded videos, assessments (daily/weekly/monthly) and face-to-face doubt-clearing sessions. “A number of students from the districts or the city outskirts were staying in Calcutta to attend classes which have been impacted by the pandemic restrictions. The online courses will make it possible for students to access the best teachers and prepare for government services,” said Samit Ray, chairman, RICE Group. RICE Education has 19 centres in Bengal and has been coaching students since 1985. “In the last 36 years, about 1.5 lakh students have found success through RICE and we believe that with the quality and affordable online support from RICE Smart, many more will attain success in government competitive exams,” said Ray. Apart from doubt-clearing sessions, the on-site interaction will simulate the experience of in-person examination. “The centres will replicate the exam experience allowing students to prepare for an exam,” said an official. The platform is available as an app that can be downloaded from the Play Store. The platform also gives students an option to download the app and experience the free demo classes before deciding to join the paid courses. The rates are Rs 20,000 for the public service commission exams, Rs 15,000 for the exams conducted by the staff selection commission and the railways and Rs 8,000 for exams conducted by banks.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-45
20-07-2021||Calcutta||Covid: Halt in case slide sparks concern among state govt officials, public health experts  ||The number of new Covid cases every day has been varying between 800 and 1,000 over the past 15 days, a trend that has triggered concern among state government officials and public health experts. Several private hospitals said the rate of positivity for Covid tests and the number of patients admitted had almost remained the same over the past fortnight. According to the state health department data, Bengal recorded 885 new Covid cases on July 5. On July 18, the count was 801. In between, it hovered between 800 and 1,000. “At the peak of the second wave, the number of daily new cases in the state had gone up to around 20,000. From there it has dropped below 1,000. We were expecting it to drop even further by now,” said a senior official of the state health department. The main cause of concern, the official said, was that many people were dropping their guard after the government started relaxing the Covid restrictions. “More mingling of people without safety protocols means increased chances of transmission and that can lead to mutation of the virus. We are keeping a vigil on the situation,” said the official. The health department, he said, is regularly sending samples of Covid patients to the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics to find out whether any new variant has emerged. “On Monday, the Delta variant, which drove the second wave in large parts of the country, was found in all the samples tested,” the official said. Private hospitals said the number of Covid patients admitted, after a sharp drop, has remained almost the same for the last 15 days. Peerless Hospital had 175 Covid beds in May. All of them were occupied on most days of the month. Now, the hospital has only 40 beds. On Monday, eight patients were admitted. “Since the beginning of July, two to three patients have been getting admitted daily. The rate of positivity (percentage of the samples tested positive) is not dropping below 5 per cent,” said Sudipta Mitra, the chief executive of Peerless Hospital. The RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences had cent percent occupancy in its Covid ward comprising 260 beds in May. “The number of patients had been falling drastically till 20 days back and we brought down the bed count to 25. But since the beginning of July, the number of admitted patients has remained steady at 17 or 18,” said R. Venkatesh, regional director, east, Narayana Health, which runs the Mukundapur hospital. The test positivity rate at the hospital, which had shot up to 60 per cent, is varying between 2 and 3 per cent. At Belle Vue Clinic, too, the test positivity rate has been around 2 per cent over the last fortnight. The hospital is testing around 35 samples daily, said CEO Pradip Tondon. Doctors said a more aggressive vaccination drive, along with maintaining personal safety, was the only way to ensure a further drop in the number of cases. “Even if the virus mutates, transmission can be kept under control if safety protocols are followed. If vaccination is not scaled up and people violate Covid protocols, a third wave will come,” said Chandramouli Bhattacharya, a consultant in tropical medicine and infectious diseases. Fliers’ protocol The state government on Monday announced that fliers arriving from outside the state would be required to be fully vaccinated or carry an RT-PCR negative report. The test has to be conducted within 72 hours before the flight departure.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-45

The blockade threw traffic out of gear in several pockets of south Calcutta on the first working day of the week. Police had to push back the protesters as they refused to vacate the road even after multiple requests. The protestors, who were holding posters and banners, demanded employment on Monday and shouted slogans that they heard by the Bengal police brass. “We have cleared the recruitment test. Some of our batchmates have been inducted. When will we be employed? We will go home only after the authorities tell us our joining dates,” a protester shouted. Senior officers, including deputy commissioner (south) Akash Magharia and joint commissioner (establishment) Akhilesh Chaturvedi, tried to pacify the crowd citing a stay on recruitment because of a case pending with the state administrative tribunal. “We told the protesters that the matter was pending in court and that blocking the road would not get them jobs,” said an officer. The blockade started around noon and was removed at 3pm.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-45
20-07-2021||Calcutta||City cops remove 191 beacons from vehicles of govt officials ||The city’s traffic police have removed 191 beacons over the past 72 hours from vehicles of government officials who are not entitled to them, police officers said on Monday. The majority of the bureaucrats and others who were intercepted and allegedly found violating beacon norms claimed ignorance about their ineligibility for the privilege, the officers said. Some had to be shown the transport department notification about beacon eligibility. An officer said the public servants whose vehicles were “politely” stripped of beacons were of the rank of engineer, district judicial magistrate, additional district magistrate, divisional forest officer, deputy secretary, chief medical officer of health, medical superintendent (of a government hospital), deputy superintendent of police, sub-divisional officer and director of a government establishment. The personal assistant of a state minister was spotted using a beacon in violation of norms. All 25 traffic guards in the city and the special raids section of the traffic department cracked the whip on unauthorised use of beacons from Saturday. “We are stopping every vehicle with a beacon and politely asking which department the car belongs to. Then we are asking for the rank of the officer concerned and checking whether it is on the list given to us. If the officer is entitled to the beacon, we are immediately releasing the vehicle. If not, we are requesting the officer to immediately comply with the government order,” said a traffic sergeant in south Calcutta. Several empty but beacon-fitted vehicles were stopped and the drivers asked to remove the lights when the concerned officer was not in the car. The occupants of several vehicles allegedly resisted the move and challenged the list. “A beacon-fitted vehicle was ferrying a PWD engineer. He said he was confident about his entitlement. In such cases, we did not get into arguments and noted down details of the vehicle for verification,” said a sergeant in central Calcutta. Metro reported on Saturday that the police had written to all offices of the state and central governments in the city to comply with the beacon rules issued by the Bengal government. The maximum number of violations — 19 — was reported from the south-east traffic guard, which includes pockets like Southern Avenue, Rashbehari Avenue, Lake, Gariahat and Ballygunge.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-45
20-07-2021||Business||Tax reduction, pandemic-driven cost cuts buoys India Inc net by 105% in FY21: Report||The steep corporate tax cut in 2019 and pandemic-driven cost-cutting boosted the bottomline of India Inc by 105 per cent in FY21 over FY20, even though the topline declined 5 per cent, according to a report. This also had 4,000 listed companies paying record corporate tax, a net increase of over Rs 50,000 crore in FY21 to Rs 1.90 lakh crore, from around Rs 1.40 crore in FY20, an analysis by SBI Research showed on Tuesday. The government had slashed the effective corporate tax rate from 35 to 26 per cent in September 2019, coupled with lower expenses due to the pandemic, has boosted their bottomline to record levels in FY21, the report said without citing the actual profit numbers. For these companies, average revenue fell only 5 per cent in FY21, but their net income grew by 105 per cent over FY20, the report said without quantifying it. The tax cut has contributed 19 per cent to the topline of these companies during the pandemic with cement, tyre and consumer durables gaining in excess of 50 per cent, it added. More importantly, 15 sectors led by refineries, steel, fertilisers, textiles, pharma, IT, mining, etc reduced their loan funds in the range of 6-64 per cent or to the tune of Rs 2.09 lakh crore in FY21, which again boosted their bottomline. Carrying on the benefit of cost cuts, arising from lower expenses by way of salary cuts (3 per cent overall for these 4,000 companies in the name of the pandemic), have come as a blessing in disguise for the government in FY22 as corporate tax mop-up in the first two months of the fiscal is the best in two decades at Rs 43,454 crore, up from Rs 16,981 crore in FY20, and Rs 1,126 crore in FY19, according to Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at State Bank of India. The first two months of FY22 saw the fiscal deficit at just Rs 1.2 lakh crore, only about a third of what the government has been borrowing on average at Rs 3.5 lakh crore during the same period in FY19 and FY20. The deficit reduction was on the back of higher overall tax revenue of Rs 1 lakh crore, he noted and expects the government to comfortably meet its tax revenue goals this fiscal if the tax buoyancy is maintained, which is more likely given that corporate profits are on record highs. The low-interest-rate regime has also helped companies massively deleverage, which has contributed to an average of 5 per cent to their overall topline, especially for the consumer durables, healthcare and cement sectors. For many sectors -- including engineering, reality, automobiles and trading -- the effective tax rate reduction ranged from 1 to 24 percentages in FY21. For the realty sector, it was down to 26 from 50 per cent, for automobiles it is down from 36 per cent to 33 with the least gain for FMCGs and packaging wherein it is down by only 100 bps each. Expenditure cut contributed 31 per cent to topline with most companies finding new ways to navigate the pandemic, with apparel and refineries cutting costs by 107 per cent on an average.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-135

20-07-2021||Business||Bengal opposes Andrew Yule’s shut down of Calcutta electrical division||The Mamata Banerjee government has strongly opposed Andrew Yule’s decision to close down the electrical division located in Calcutta and hand over early retirement to the employees attached to it. Bengal industry minister Partha Chatterjee wrote to Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal expressing the state’s anguish over the decision of the central PSU. Chatterjee, who had worked in Andrew Yule before joining active politics, requested that the company continue with full fledged operations from the city units. Reminding Goyal about the nationalisation of Yule in 1974 and the PSU receiving an award from the Centre for a turnaround in 2011, Chatterjee said the closure would hurt its  iconic stature and deprive workers of their livelihood. There are about 500 people, direct and contractual, attached to the two units of the electrical division based in Khidderpore. “It would also send a disheartening signal to all employees and industry leaders involved in the turnaround. I would request you to consider the continuation of the company in its full fledged role and all its operations may be continued as usual from the Calcutta-based units,” Chatterjee wrote on June 23. Six days later Goyal replied to Chatterjee saying the letter had been “sent to the division concerned for consideration and necessary action as per rules”. However, the Yule management told the unions on Monday that the company plans to go ahead with closure of the Calcutta as well as Chennai electric divisions. The company is yet to get a nod from the Union ministry of heavy industries. The union suggested that Yule bosses should write to the Bengal government to increase offtake of transformers and other electrical items produced by the division to make the loss making unit viable. Meanwhile, minister Chatterjee said the Bengal government welcomed any investment from Tata Group in the state. “We are looking for one or two big-ticket investments,” he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-135

The apex court in September last year had given 10 years to the telecom players struggling to pay Rs 93,520 crore of AGR-related dues. A bench headed by Justice L.N. Rao referred to the earlier order passed by the apex court in the matter and observed that they said no re-assessment of AGR related dues can be done. However, the companies submitted that arithmetical errors can be rectified and there are cases of duplication of entries. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi appearing for Vodafone on Monday submitted the operators were not “raising any contentious issue, not asking for a review”. “There are arithmetic errors in AGR... if I have paid Re 1, only 50 paisa is reflected. There are cases where third check isn’t reflected,” Rohatgi said pleading that Vodafone should be allowed to place these details before the DoT. Senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, appearing for Airtel, said there are cases of duplication and also of payments made but not accounted for. He said these issues should be considered by the DoT. “I don’t want to pay thousands of crores on account of these errors,” he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-136

RCF is a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Capital Ltd. Authum had made a bid of a little over Rs 1,600 crore, which will translate to a haircut of around 80 per cent for the lenders. Reliance Commercial Finance had an estimated debt of around Rs 9,000 crore. However, the lenders will get an additional cash and cash equivalent of over Rs 250 crore, thus improving their recovery. This is the second Anil Ambani group firm in which Authum has emerged as the winner.

In a written reply to a question raised by Trinamul MP Mohua Moitra, minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary spoke of the probe but did not provide details on the nature of the violations or which firms were being probed by Sebi. The TMC MP had sought details on the ultimate beneficial ownership of FPIs in the Adani group firms and whether any investigation was being done by agencies either on the foreign investors or on Adani group companies. She also sought a clarification on whether the depository accounts of three FPIs were frozen. “In a matter pertaining to issuances of GDR by certain Indian listed companies, Sebi vide order dated June 16, 2016, had directed depositories to freeze particular beneficiary accounts of certain FPIs, including Albula Investment Fund, Cresta Fund and APMS Investment Fund Ltd,” Chaudhary said. He added that no order for any other beneficiary accounts of the three FPIs have been passed by the market watchdog. “Six firms of the Adani group are listed and traded on recognised bourses in India. The holding of FPIs is based on day-to-day trading of shares and thus dynamic,” he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-136
20-07-2021||Business||Centre: No plan for Covid-19 bonds to raise fiscal resources||The Centre on Monday said it has no plans to come up with Covid-19 bonds to raise fiscal resources amidst suggestions on such bonds by experts. “The government does not plan to raise fiscal resources through borrowings by issuing Covid bonds,” minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said in the Lok Sabha on Monday to a written question. Niti Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar earlier this month had said “well give it whatever name you like, the point is that if the government needs to borrow more money for expanding capital expenditure, it could go ahead because that will attract more private investments”. Former RBI governor D. Subbarao had also proposed Covid bonds. He said the bonds could provide relief to savers “who are short-changed by the low-interest rates on bank fixed deposits”. PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) had also suggested the government should issue special Covid bonds to raise funds for providing stimulus. “The issuance of special Covid bonds could be an appropriate substitute to market borrowings by the government,” it said. Oil price The Opec+ pact to raise output will have little effect on fuel prices in the country. Unless the Modi government blinks on duties, consumers are unlikely to get any relief, analysts said. Government revenues ballooned 88 per cent to Rs 3.35 lakh crore in the last fiscal from petrol and diesel excise duties. The benchmark Brent on Monday dropped 6.31 per cent to $68.63 per barrel following the agreement among the members of the oil cartel. Madan Sabnavis, chief economist of CARE Ratings, said for every $5-per-barrel drop in Brent price the final price of petrol will come down by Rs 3.58 per litre. “Quite clearly the government has to give in somewhere if we want to reduce the price significantly to have an impact on price and overall inflation. We do not believe that this will be too beneficial for us.” Vivad se Vishwas Over 1.32 lakh declarations entailing disputed tax of Rs 99,765 crore have been filed under the “Vivad se Vishwas” dispute resolution scheme, Parliament was informed on Monday.

20-07-2021||Business||Benchmark indices end deep in the red||Benchmark indices on Monday ended deep in the red as a renewed surge in Covid cases and disappointing numbers from HDFC Bank weighed on investor sentiment. The Sensex plunged 587 points and the Nifty 171 points, tracking weak global cues as the US, the UK, Australia and Japan reported a fresh rise in Covid cases. Stock markets and currencies in Asia saw heavy losses as some countries in the region tightened curbs to tackle a highly contagious Delta variant-fuelled surge of infections that sparked a sell-off in risky assets. The Indian rupee dropped to its lowest level in three months on Monday, in line with other Asian currencies. The rupee ended at 74.87/88 per dollar, compared with its close of 74.56 on Friday. The currency fell 0.4 per on the day, its biggest single-day fall since June 17. “The bias of risk appetite is gradually turning towards riskoff as markets evaluate the impact of a resurgence in Covid19 cases worldwide against a backdrop of escalating inflation environment and emergence of US-China tensions,” said Upasna Bharadwaj, economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank. In India, investors who had seen good results from IT services firms, received a jolt last Saturday when HDFC Bank failed to meet analyst estimates. The deterioration in its asset quality during the first quarter led to concerns that other banks may also see similar pressure, leading to selling in financials. Foreign portfolio investors sold stocks worth Rs 2,199 crore on Monday. The 30-share Sensex began the day on a weak note at 52606.99 and fell 734.77 points to the day’s low of 52405.89. It finally closed down 586.66 points, or 1.10 per cent, at 52553.40, while the Nifty fell 171 points, or 1.07 per cent, to 15752.40. Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, feels it would be a tough fight between the “bulls and bears” in the coming days and one needs to remain watchful of possible movement in either direction. IPO gains Shares of speciality chemical manufacturer Clean Science and Technology Ltd zoomed over 76 per cent in debut trade to close at Rs 1,585.20 on Monday against its issue price of Rs 900. The stock opened at Rs 1,784.40, a premium of 98.26 per cent. Shares of GR Infraprojects also made a strong debut on Monday, closing the day at Rs 1,746.80, a premium of nearly 109 per cent against the issue price of Rs 837.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-136
20-07-2021||India||Pegasus: Karnataka Congress-JDS leaders were potential targets in 2019||The leaders of the Congress and the Janata Dal Secular in Karnataka were possible targets of Israeli spyware ‘Pegasus’ in 2019, the Wire has said in the latest revelations on Tuesday. In its latest report, the Wire has revealed that phone numbers of the then Karnataka deputy chief minister G Parameshwara and the personal secretaries of Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy and former chief minister Siddaramaiah were allegedly selected as potential targets. The report of the news portal links the fall of the JDS-Congress government in July 2019 and the BJP’s takeover to alleged snooping — an allegation echoed by the opposition Congress — though there is no evidence to establish whether phones were hacked. According to the Wire, these numbers showed up in its review of the list of numbers “of interest” to an Indian client of Israel’s NSO group, which sells its Pegasus spyware only to governments. The Congress said it was clear that Pegasus was used to execute ‘Operation Lotus’ to topple the state government and the ruling BJP at the Centre facilitated it. “I was surprised to know that Pegasus has compromised my phone when I was deputy chief minister, and that of Siddaramaiah and chief minister’s secretary. Snooping activity by Pegasus is highly condemnable... Without the permission of the government of India, either the ministry of Home or the PM’s office, they cannot do it. I am sure the government is involved. I condemn this... They have misused their power to topple governments in this country,” Parameshwara told the NDTV. Kumaraswamy, who has himself faced allegations of phone-tapping, said “every party” in power misused information. “Regarding the phone tapping issue for last two days, latest addition today is the Karnataka development. Opposition leaders from Karnataka, that is Siddaramaiah, Parameshwara and myself when we were running the coalition government, at that time, BJP friends they are misusing their good office to get information by tapping our phones. I am not interested because this issue is over,” he told the NDTV. The phone numbers form part of a leaked database accessed by the French media non-profit Forbidden Stories and shared with an international media consortium as part of what is called the Pegasus Project. However, it is not established whether the phones were infected or hacked. The Wire says the period coincides with the selection of a new number Congress leader Rahul Gandhi began to use after discarding his earlier one. The JDS-Congress government fell after the abrupt resignation of 17 MLAs, who later joined the BJP and helped BS Yediyurappa return to power. In the nerve-wracking power tussle leading up to the transition, rebel MLAs were sequestered at a hotel in Mumbai for days and Congress leader DK Shivakumar tried and failed to meet them. The MLAs were finally disqualified after they turned in their resignation. After Yediyurappa took power, the MLAs joined the BJP and contested bypolls. Many of them became ministers in the BJP government. The Wire said two phone numbers belonged to Satish, the personal secretary of Kumaraswamy. The phone number of Siddaramaiah’s personal secretary Venkatesh was also added at the time. The JDS and Congress had accused the BJP of engineering defections and bringing about the fall of the government with active help from the Centre. Over the past few days, The Wire, Washington Post and other media partners in the “Pegasus project” have revealed that the numbers of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, poll strategist Prashant Kishor, two union ministers, Trinamool Congress leader Abhishek Banerjee and some 40 journalists were selected as potential targets of snooping.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-413

20-07-2021||India|| Punjab Congress crisis: Apology rider set by CM team to meet Sidhu||Punjab minister Brahm Mohindra on Tuesday ruled out any personal meeting with newly-appointed state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu till he resolves his issues with Chief Minister Amarinder Singh.  He said this on a day when Sidhu went to Amritsar, where he got a rousing welcome from his supporters and Congress workers.  These are the first such remarks by any minister after Sidhu was elevated to the key post, indicating that the crisis in the Punjab Congress is still not over.  In a statement issued here, Mohindra said the party high-command's decision to appoint Sidhu as the state Congress chief is welcome.  "However, I will not meet him (Sidhu) till he meets the chief minister and resolves his issues with him," he said.  Mohindra said Singh is the leader of the Congress Legislative Party (CLP) and he is duty-bound to follow him.  Besides being the CLP leader, the chief minister also heads the cabinet of which he is a part, the senior Congress leader said, making it clear that unless Sidhu sorts out all issues with Singh, he will not meet him personally.  "We have a collective responsibility and hence, I would refrain from meeting the newly-appointed (party) president till issues between him and the chief minister are resolved," Mohindra said.  Singh last week was learnt to have told All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Harish Rawat that he will not meet Sidhu until he tenders an apology for his "derogatory" tweets against him.  The suspense over a possible truce between Sidhu and Singh continues as there has been no reaction from the chief minister over the Amritsar East MLA's elevation to the post of Punjab Congress chief.  Before going to Amritsar, Sidhu had been calling on ministers and legislators in Chandigarh to mobilise support.  He had already met several ministers, including Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Charanjit Singh Channi, Razia Sultana, Sukhbinder Sarkaria, Gurpreet Singh Kangar and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa.  Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal has also congratulated Sidhu on becoming the president of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC).  Sidhu will pay obeisance at the Golden Temple in Amritsar on Wednesday and many Congress leaders are expected to be there. "Reports of @sherryontop seeking time to meet @capt_amarinder are totally false. No time has been sought whatsoever. No change in stance... CM won't meet #NavjotSinghSidhu till he publicly apologises for his personally derogatory social media attacks against him," Raveen Thukral wrote.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-413

Also, there has been no delay in placing orders with domestic vaccine manufacturers, rather advance orders of vaccines are placed with Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech for supply of Covid-19 vaccines, Minister of state for health Bharati Pravin Pawar said in a written reply. Responding to a question on whether many states including the hardest-hit Maharashtra were complaining about shortage of vaccines during the last three months, she said, “There has been no shortage of Cvid-19 vaccines and the government of India has been providing free supply of vaccines to states and UTs for administration to prioritised beneficiaries as recommended by NEGVAC.” Advance visibility of these allocations i.e. the total doses of vaccine that would be available to a state and union territory, are provided to them 15 days in advance so as to enable them prepare plan for acceleration of vaccination coverage while being cognizant of the available vaccines, the minister said. She also refuted allegations of any delay in placing order of vaccines and said, “There have been no delay in placing orders with domestic vaccine manufacturers rather advance orders of vaccines are placed with Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech for supply of Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-413
20-07-2021||India||Once India starts reopening schools, it will be wise to begin with primary section: ICMR chief||Once India starts reopening schools, it will be wise to begin with the primary section as children have a lower number of ace receptors to which virus attaches, making them much better at handling viral infections than adults, said ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava on Tuesday. He, however, stressed that for such a step to be considered, it must be ensured that school teachers and other support staff members are vaccinated. Addressing a press conference, he said the Indian Council of Medical Research's (ICMR's) latest national serosurvey has found that the seroprevalence among those aged six to nine was 57.2 per cent which is very similar to adults. Asked about opening schools since Covid-19 cases have declined in many districts, Bhargava said children can handle viral infection much better than adults and it has also been established that they have a lower number of ace receptors to which virus attaches. "In some countries, particularly the Scandinavian ones, they (authorities) did not shut down their primary schools during the first, second or third wave... whatever (Covid) waves they had, their primary schools were always open. "So, once India starts considering opening schools, it will be wise to begin with the primary schools. Also, we have to ensure that all support staff members, be it school bus drivers or teachers, are vaccinated," Bhargava said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-413
20-07-2021||India||Umar Khalid, Anirban Bhattacharya, prominent activists on Pegasus list||The phone numbers of former JNU students Umar Khalid, Anirban Bhattacharya, Banjyotsana Lahiri and several prominent Indian activists are among those listed as the potential targets of Israeli spyware Pegasus, an international media consortium reported on Tuesday. The Wire news portal, in the third part of its revelations from the international collaborative journalistic investigation called the Pegasus Project, reported that those marked as potential targets for surveillance include Ambedkarite activist Ashok Bharti; academic and chronicler of life in Naxal-dominated regions Bela Bhatia; railway union leader Shiv Gopal Mishra and Delhi-based labour rights activist Anjani Kumar. Anti-coal mining activist Alok Shukla, Delhi University professor Saroj Giri, Bastar-based peace activist Shubhranshu Choudhary and Bihar-based activist Ipsa Shatakshi are also on the list, the report noted. "Without digital forensics, it is not possible to conclusively establish whether their phones were hacked or infected. But their appearance on the list suggests that they were persons of interest to an unidentified client of the NSO Group that was focused on India," the report said. The Pegasus spyware was created by Israeli technology firm NSO. The government has dismissed the reports on the use of Pegasus software to snoop on Indians, saying the allegations levelled just ahead of the Monsoon session of Parliament are aimed at maligning Indian democracy . Ashok Bharti, the chairman of All India Ambedkar Mahasabha, an umbrella association of Dalit rights' groups, had led a nationwide Bharat Bandh on April, 2, 2018 against a Supreme Court ruling, which he claimed took away the teeth of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The ruling sparked massive demonstrations across the country, and the Bharat Bandh claimed 11 lives and left hundreds injured. In 2019, WhatsApp stated that four of the activists mentioned above -- Saroj Giri, Bela Bhatia, Alok Shukla and Shubranshu Choudhary -- were affected by a Pegasus attack that took place through a specific vulnerability in the company's security. Two of the former JNU students -- Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya -- were among those charged for sedition over an event on JNU campus where anti-national slogans were allegedly raised. Khalid is currently in jail for charges under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in connection with the northeast Delhi riots of February 2020. The report has been published by The Wire news portal from India in collaboration with 16 other international publications including the Washington Post, The Guardian and Le Monde, as media partners to an investigation conducted by Paris-based media non-profit organisation Forbidden Stories and rights group Amnesty International. The investigation focuses on a leaked list of more than 50,000 phone numbers from across the world that are believed to have been the target of surveillance through Pegasus software of Israeli surveillance company NSO Group.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-414
20-07-2021||India||4.8 crore jabs administered in tribal districts till July 15, says Centre||A total of 4.81 crore doses of Covid vaccine have been administered in 176 identified tribal districts across 25 states till July 15, the government has informed Lok Sabha. The Centre, however, said it does not maintain "centralised data on COVID-19 mortality with urban, rural, tribal breakup". Replying to a question, Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Renuka Singh Saruta said, "The Covid-19 vaccination drive does not make any discrimination on the basis of gender, socio-economic class or residence, etc." However, all efforts have been made to ensure vaccination of people in tribal areas, including options of registration at common service centres, 'walk-in registration' at Covid vaccination centre and 'near-to-home vaccination centres' for elderly people and people with disabilities, she said on Monday. "The CoWIN portal does not maintain records of religion or caste of the beneficiaries. However, in the 176 identified tribal districts, as on July 15, a total of 4.81 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered," the minister told Lok Sabha. Tribal communities are geographically and socio-economically relatively segregated and have poor access to health care and accordingly, she said, adding that the government has issued a standard operating procedure on Covid containment and management in peri-urban, rural and tribal areas. According to data shared by the Tribal Affairs Ministry, 62.14 lakh doses have been administered in 19 tribal districts of Madhya Pradesh till July 15. In 19 tribal districts of Chhattisgarh, 57.8 lakh vaccine jabs have been provided from January 16, when the inoculation exercise started, to July 15. According to the 2011 census, India has a tribal population of 10.5 crore. To ramp up Covid vaccination among tribal people, the Centre had last week launched a campaign focusing on dispelling myths, misconceptions and fear about jabs. The government has involved traditional leaders and local influencers to be a part of the campaign. The Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, along with UNICEF and WHO, will be conducting the campaign. It has already been initiated in Bastar in Chhattisgarh and Mandla in Madhya Pradesh.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-414
20-07-2021||India||India may become first country to have DNA-based Covid jab, says health minister||Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday said several Indian companies are increasing their production of COVID-19 vaccines and that the country may become the first in the world to develop a DNA-based vaccine. Replying to a short duration discussion on COVID-19 management in Rajya Sabha, the minister said technology transfer to several companies has started and they will begin production in the coming days to reduce vaccine shortage in the country. "Cadila has completed third phase trial of its DNA vaccine and has applied for emergency use authorisation before DCGI (Drugs Controller General of India). Our expert team is looking into it. When this will come in the market, India will be the only country where scientists have developed a DNA vaccine," Mandaviya said in Rajya Sabha. He said that the country has started getting 11-12 crore doses of Serum Institute's Covishield vaccine per month and Bharat Biotech will supply 3.5 crore doses of its Covid vaccine in August. He said that the states are given vaccine availability projections 15 days in advance and that it's their responsibility to plan the inoculation drive accordingly. The minister said that Biological E is conducting third phase of trial of its vaccine and it is expected to come in the market by September-October with 7.5 crore doses. "Zydus Cadila and Bharat Biotech have started trials on children. I expect their trials to be successful. We need to trust our scientists. I trust my scientists and indigenous companies," Mandaviya said. On the allegation of suppressing Covid deaths, the minister said that the registration of Covid deaths is done by states and that the central government has never asked any state to record less deaths or cases. It is not appropriate to say that the Covid third wave will hit children more, the minister stressed citing experience of the previous waves. Mandaviya told the House that 316 oxygen plants out of the total 1,573 planned have been commissioned and the rest will start operations by August-end. Earlier, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjuna Kharge said that the government's COVID-19 death toll figure of 4-5 lakh is "false" and conservative and claimed the average number of deaths cannot be less than 52.4 lakh so far in the country.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-414
20-07-2021||India||No Covid deaths due to lack of oxygen during second wave, says Centre||No deaths due to lack of oxygen were specifically reported by states and UTs during the second Covid-19 wave, the government informed Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. But there was an unprecedented surge in demand for medical oxygen during the second wave and it peaked at nearly 9000 Metric Tonnes compared to 3095 MT in the first wave following which the Centre had to step in to facilitate equitable distribution among the states, it said. Responding to a question on whether a large number of Covid-19 patients died on roads and hospitals due to acute shortage of oxygen in the second wave, Minister of State for Health Bharati Praveen Pawar noted that health is a state subject and states and UTs regularly report the number of cases and deaths to the Centre. "Detailed guidelines for reporting of deaths have been issued by the Union Health Ministry to all states and UTs. "Accordingly, all states and UTs report cases and deaths to the Union Health Ministry on a regular basis. However, no deaths due to lack of oxygen have been specifically reported by states and UTs," Pawar said in a written reply. The Government of India has supported the states and undertook a series of actions including provisioning medical oxygen, and other consumables to ensure clinical care of Covid-19 patients in view of the steep rise of Covid-19 trajectory in the country during April- May 2021. On the total demand of oxygen by the states and total oxygen supplied, the ministry said the supply of medical oxygen to hospitals is determined by contractual arrangements between the hospital and the medical oxygen supplier concerned. "However, due to unprecedented surge in demand of medical oxygen during the second wave the demand in the country peaked to nearly 9000 MT as compared to 3095 MT during the first wave the central government had to step in to facilitate equitable distribution to the states. "A dynamic and transparent framework for allocation of medical oxygen in consultation with states and UTs and all the stakeholders such as relevant ministries, manufacturers/suppliers of liquid oxygen, etc. was prepared," the written reply stated. The active caseload of the state and UT was the primary determinant of oxygen allocation. Other factors such as case doubling rate, available medical infrastructure, etc. were also given due consideration. Further, the allocation was kept dynamic as per the changing pandemic load. The first allocation order was issued on April 15 2021 and revised from time to time, based on the trends of active cases and supply position. A total allocation of 10,250 MT has been done to 26 high burden states as on May 28, 2021, the reply said. The Government of India, along with the state governments, took all possible steps to tackle the unprecedented surge in oxygen demand that arose in the second wave of Covid-19. This includes enhancement of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) production from 5700 MTs in August 2020 to 9690 MTs in May 2021, restrictions on industrial use of oxygen; and augmentation of availability of containers. A dynamic and transparent framework for allocation of medical oxygen in consultation with states and UTs and all the stakeholders such as relevant Ministries, manufacturers/suppliers of liquid oxygen, etc. was prepared. Also, online digital solutions viz. Oxygen Demand Aggregation system (ODAS) and Oxygen Digital Tracking System (ODTS) have been developed to ascertain the demand for medical oxygen from all medical facilities and to track their transportation. Further, to avoid wastage of medical oxygen, guidelines on rational use of oxygen were issued on 25th September 2020. These were further revised and disseminated to States on 25th April 2021. The states were also provided with oxygen equipment such as oxygen cylinders, concentrators and Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants. A total of 4,02,517 oxygen cylinders have been procured or are being procured and distributed to the states. As many as 1,222 PSA Oxygen generation plants have been sanctioned. Out of these, as on 15th July 2021, 237 plants have been commissioned. Apart from this, 295 PSA plants are being installed by different ministries, the minister said. States have also been asked to prepare state-level oxygen generation plants. To increase the storage capacity of liquid medical oxygen in the states, under the emergency Covid Package-Part-II, 1050 Liquid Medical Oxygen Tanks along with MGPS at a cost of Rs. 80 Lakh each have been approved.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-414
20-07-2021||India||Around 40 crore people are still vulnerable to Covid-19, says Centre||Around 40 crore people are still vulnerable to Covid-19 infection as a nationwide survey found two-thirds of the country's population aged above six to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, the government said on Tuesday as it stressed there is no room for complacency in the fight against the pandemic. Findings of the ICMR's 4th national Covid sero survey show there is a ray of hope, but there is no room for complacency and Covid-appropriate behaviour has to be followed, the government said. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) conducted the latest survey in June-July. Addressing a press conference, a senior official said two-thirds or 67.6 per cent of India's population aged above 6 years were found to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the latest national sero survey. A third of the population did not have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which means about 40 crore people are still vulnerable to Covid-19 infection, the official said. According to the government, 85 per cent of the surveyed healthcare workers had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and one-tenth of HCWs were still unvaccinated. The survey covered 28,975 general population and 7,252 healthcare workers. The fourth round of the survey was conducted in the 70 districts across 21 states where the previous three rounds had been carried out. Stressing observance of Covid-19-appropriate behaviour, the government said social, religious and political congregations should be avoided and non-essential travels should be discouraged. "Travel only if fully vaccinated," it said. The ICMR also suggested that it would be wise to consider reopening primary schools first as children can handle viral infection much better. ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava stressed that for such a step to be considered, it must be ensured that school teachers and other support staff members are vaccinated. Addressing the press conference, he said the Indian Council of Medical Research's (ICMR's) latest national serosurvey has found that the seroprevalence among those aged six to nine was 57.2 per cent which is very similar to adults. Asked about opening schools since Covid-19 cases have declined in many districts, Bhargava said children can handle viral infection much better than adults and it has also been established that they have a lower number of ace receptors to which virus attaches. "In some countries, particularly the Scandinavian ones, they (authorities) did not shut down their primary schools during the first, second or third wave... whatever (Covid) waves they had, their primary schools were always open.  "So, once India starts considering opening schools, it will be wise to begin with the primary schools.

India recorded 30,093 new coronavirus infections, the lowest in 125 days, taking the total tally of Covid-19 cases to 3,11,74,322, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Tuesday. The death toll climbed to 4,14,482 with 374 daily fatalities, the lowest in 111 days, while the active cases have declined to 4,06,130, the lowest in 117 days.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-414
20-07-2021||India||Govt still is and will alway remain open to talks with peasants: Tomar||The government on Tuesday said it will remain open to discussions with protesting farmers' unions to resolve issues over three new agriculture laws passed by Parliament in September last year. In written replies to Lok Sabha on several questions related to farmers' protest, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the government had so far held 11 rounds of negotiations talks with agitating farmers' unions to resolve the issues. "The government has been engaged in serious, sensitive and active discussions with the farmers' unions to resolve the issues. During various rounds of discussions, government continuously requested the farmers' unions to discuss the provisions of the farm laws, so that if there is an objection to any provision, the advancement can be made towards resolution of those," the minister said. “But the farmers' unions insisted only on the repeal of the farm laws,” he added. "Government is always open to discussion with farmers' unions and will remain open to discussion with agitating farmers to resolve the issue," Tomar said. In all the rounds of discussions with the farmers' unions, the minister said the government had stressed that instead of insisting on the demand for the repeal of the laws, the unions should discuss about their concerns on the clauses of farm Acts so that their concerns can be resolved. Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi's borders for more than seven months in protest against the three laws that they say will end state procurement of crops at MSP (Minimum Support Price). Supreme Court has put on hold the implementation of the three laws till further orders and set up a committee to find solutions. During the 10th round of talks held on January 20, the Centre had offered to suspend the laws for 1-1.5 years and form a joint committee to find solutions in return for protesting farmers going back to their respective homes from Delhi's borders. The farmers' unions have been agitating against the three laws -- 'The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020', 'The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement On Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020' and 'The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The demands of agitating farmers' unions are repealing the three farm laws, keeping farmers outside the penalty provision on straw burning under Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, 2020, withdrawing the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020, and issues-related to procurement at Minimum Support Price (MSP). "Giving top priority to the interest of farmers, government vide letter dated 9th December, 2020 addressed to farmers' unions, explained point by point, how the concerns expressed by the farmers were being taken care of in the proposal of the Government of India. "Government also proposed to constitute a small group consisting of representative of farmers' unions, who can deliberate on farm laws clause-wise in a time-bound manner and can also consider other issues related to farmers, which representatives of farmers' unions have not agreed. However, farmers' unions never agreed to discuss the farm laws except for demanding their repeal," Tomar said. The minister said these laws are intended to provide an ecosystem where the farmers can enjoy the freedom of choice relating to sale of farmers' produce which facilitates remunerative prices to farmers through competitive alternative channels for selling their produce. "These farm Acts will facilitate direct buying from farmers in trade area by traders, processors, exporters, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), agriculture co-operative societies etc., so as to facilitate farmers with better price realisation due to reduction in supply chain and marketing cost to enhance their income," he added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-414
20-07-2021||India||Delhi riots: Court acquits man accused of unlawful assembly, dacoity ||A court here on Tuesday acquitted a man of rioting, dacoity, and other charges in a case of ransacking and looting a shop during the north-east Delhi riots in February last year. Calling it a clear-cut case of acquittal, Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat said there was no identification of the accused, and the testimonies of the witnesses were completely contradictory to each other. This is the first judgment in the case concerning the riots that broke out in north-east Delhi in February 2020 during the anti-CAA protests. Trial is underway in many cases related to the violence that killed 53 people. According to the police, Suresh, now acquitted, along with a huge crowd of rioters carrying iron rods and sticks, allegedly broke open the lock of a shop situated in Delhi's Babarpur Road and looted it on the evening of February 25. The shop belonged to one Bhagat Singh and was rented to Asif, who is the complainant in the case. During the investigation, Singh told the police that the rioters were aggressive and wanted to loot the said shop because it was of a Muslim and he tried to stop them but in vain . Both Singh and Head Constable Sunil, who was the beat constable in the area, later identified Suresh as part of the rioters. Suresh was arrested on April 7, 2020 and released on bail on February 25, 2021 after spending ten months in Mandoli Jail. On March 9, 2021, the court framed charges against him under sections 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 427 (mischief), 454 (lurking house-trespass) read with section 149 (unlawful assembly) and section 395 (dacoity) of the IPC.

20-07-2021||India||Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal to not attend PM's Covid meet||The main opposition Congress said it wouldn't attend the government's meeting with floor leaders of all parties on Covid-19 later on Tuesday. Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said the Congress is not boycotting the meeting, but it will not attend as it wants the government to present the facts on the floor of both houses of Parliament. "If he (PM Modi) wants to give a presentation on Covid, he should give it in the Central Hall separately to MPs and Rajya Sabha members. MPs should be allowed to discuss Covid-related issues in their constituencies," Kharge was quoted as saying by ndtv.com. The ruling BJP's erstwhile ally SAD will also not attend the meeting, its president Sukhbir Singh Badal said. "Today Shiromani Akali Dal will boycott PM Modi's briefing on Covid-19. It will be attended only after he calls a meeting to discuss farm issues," he said. The government has called the meeting of floor leaders of all parties on the Covid-19 management. The Health Secretary is expected to make a presentation in the meeting, which is likely to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-414
20-07-2021||India||Govt not to enumerate caste-wise population other than SC, ST in census||The government has decided as a matter of policy not to enumerate caste-wise population other than SCs and STs in the census, Lok Sabha was informed on Tuesday. Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai also said that according to the provisions of the Constitution, the seats are reserved for SCs and STs in Lok Sabha and in the assemblies in proportion, as nearly as may be, to their population. Rai said in census, the castes and tribes which are specifically notified as Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as per the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order 1950 and the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950 (as amended from time to time) are enumerated. "The state governments of Maharashtra and Odisha have requested to collect caste details in the forthcoming census. The government of India has decided as a matter of policy not to enumerate caste-wise population other than SCs and STs in census," he said replying to a written question. Replying to another question, Rai said the intent of the government for conducting census 2021 has been notified in the Gazette of India on March 28, 2019 but due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the census activities have been postponed.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-414
20-07-2021||India||A total of 45,453 cases of black fungus reported in India, says health minister||A total of 45,432 cases of mucormycosis have been reported by states and UTs till July 15 of which 21,085 affected people are receiving treatment and 4,252 have died, the Rajya Sabha was informed on Tuesday. A large majority of mucormycosis patients (84.4 per cent) had reported a history of Covid-19, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said in a written reply. Most common presentations of mucormycosis include Rhinocerebral (77.6 per cent), Cutaneous (4.3 per cent) and Pulmonary (3.0 per cent). In the wake of second wave of Covid-19, an increased number of mucormycosis cases were reported and the Ministry of Health after thorough gap analysis and consultations took a number of steps to address the problem. "Mucormycosis and other fungal infections are most commonly seen as opportunistic infection. They are found in those with low underlying immunity either due to a diabetes, cancers particularly hematological malignancies, etc. or as a side effect of prolonged/irrational use of certain drugs like steroids, immunosuppressive drugs for management of other disorders including Covid-19," the minister explained. Mandaviya said although it is not a new disease, its true incidence during the beginning of the second wave was unknown as it was not a notifiable disease. The Ministry of Health in May requested states to declare Mucormycosis a notifiable disease under the Epidemic Disease Act to get an objective assessment of the disease. Taking cognizance of association between elevated blood sugar levels (whether in patients with pre-existing diabetes mellitus, or hyperglycemia due to steroid therapy), an updated Clinical Guidance on Diagnosis and Management of Diabetes at Covid-19 Patient Management facility was issued by the ministry on June 1. After expert deliberations in the National Task Force on Covid-19, a detailed advisory on treatment and management of Covid-19 associated Mucormycosis (CAM) was formalized and disseminated on June 7. Amphotericin-B has been prescribed and it is available in two formulations, Liposomal Amphotericin B and Amphotericin B Deoxycholate, which are similar in efficacy. However, the latter needs to be used with greater caution with respect to its effects on kidney function test and electrolyte imbalance, the minister explained. The second drug of choice is Posaconazole which may be used in cases with compromised renal function, drug reaction to Amphotericin B, electrolyte imbalance or in non-availability of Amphotericin B. A checklist for managing mucormycosis and other fungal infections was also circulated to all states and UTs on June 11. The clinical management guidelines for managing Covid-19 cases by the ministry advocates rational use of steroids for managing moderate to severe cases of Covid-19 under medical supervision. For the reporting of cases and deaths due to mucormycosis, the ministry has requested the states and UTs to submit the details on the Covid-19 India portal. States were asked to update the data on the portal which has helped the ministry to analyse and keep a track of evolving nature of problem. In response to a question on whether the government has taken cognisance of shortage in supply of Amphotericin-B injections used for the treatment of mucormycosis, Mandaviya said since early May the details of production, stock, supplies made and purchase orders were obtained from manufacturers and their cooperation was sought to overcome the gap between supply and demand. Both first and second line drugs used for managing mucormycosis cases are currently amply available in Indian markets, he said. The Department of Pharmaceuticals (DoP), Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) & National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) have been jointly monitoring the production and availability of critical Covid drugs including Amphotericin-B injections, he said in the reply. The Centre has taken various measures to improve the availability of Amphotericin B (liposomal) through a multipronged approach of augmenting production, and import and ensure equitable distribution to states and UTs. It is also engaging with manufacturers to resolve issues related to raw materials. The Department of Pharmaceuticals and the Indian Embassy in the US are working continuously with Mylan Labs for increasing import and ensuring early delivery from M/s Gilead Inc. USA. For equitable distribution, allotments are being made to the states and UTs in accordance with the proportion of their reported case load. Supply arrangements are being monitored by the National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Authority (NPPA) to ensure expeditious availability of the drug, the reply stated. The NPPA has put in place a strongly responsive system to ensure timely supplies of allocated volumes and maintains continuous contact with states and UTs and suppliers. The treatment of mucormycosis and other fungal infection is provided free of cost in all Central Government hospitals and autonomous institutions under the ministry, he said in a separate reply. Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY provides free health cover up to Rs. 5 lakh per year per family. The scheme was launched with 10.74 crore beneficiary families. However, 33 states/UTs have increased the beneficiary base to 13.44 families. Beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY can avail free treatment of post-Covid related complications including Mucormycosis, Black Fungus etc. under the scheme. States are also being supported in terms of allocation and supply of Amphotericin B. Amphotericin B is being provided at an affordable price under the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojna (PMBJP).||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-414
20-07-2021||India||India needs 188 crore doses to vaccinate all above 18 years, says Centre||The projected 18-plus population in the country is 94 crore and therefore, the total requirement of Covid-19 vaccine doses for the beneficiaries in this age group is 188 crore, but the number may reduce if in the future, single-dose vaccines are approved and used, the government told Parliament on Tuesday. In a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha on whether the present Covid vaccine manufacturing firms have the capacity to produce the required quantity, Minister of State for Health Bharati Praveen Pawar said it is estimated that around 1.87 billion (187 crore) doses will be available between January and December 2021. In addition, a few vaccines under development may also receive approval and may be available for use to inoculate the eligible population, she added. In a separate written reply, Pawar said the price of the Covid vaccines declared by the two domestic manufacturers for procurement by private hospitals is Rs 600 for Covishield and Rs 1,200 for Covaxin. In addition, Rs 948 is the price declared for Sputnik V, which is presently imported in the country. The government has fixed a maximum service charge of Rs 150 per dose over and above the price of the vaccines for administration at private Covid-19 vaccination centres (CVCs). However, the vaccines continue to be provided for free to all eligible beneficiaries at the government CVCs. "The manufacturers are free to fix the price of the vaccines for procurement by private hospitals. However, the same has to be declared in a transparent manner, which has been done by the firms," the minister said. Replying to another question, Pawar informed that the Covid vaccines presently available in the country do not have VVMs (Vaccine Vial Monitors). The storage and transportation of the vaccines from the manufacturer to the site of administration is ensured in a temperature-controlled environment at 2-8 degrees Celsius. The VVM is manufactured by a single offshore manufacturer and requires end-point studies at various duration to finalise the type to be used on each vaccine. In view of the global urgency to use Covid vaccines upon development, the requirement of a very high quantity of VVMs and the limited production capacity, the vaccines are being used without VVMs across the world, the minister said. A robust cold chain network of around 29,000 cold-chain points, along with insulated or refrigerated vaccine vans, is used to ensure the storage and transport of the vaccines in a temperature-controlled environment. The storage temperature is also being monitored on a real-time basis to ensure that the vaccines are not exposed beyond the recommended storage temperature, the reply stated.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-415

Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai said this in the Lok Sabha in response to a question on whether the central government has any plan to send a delegation to identify the difficulties being faced by the people of Lakshadweep. "The government keeps the welfare of the people at the centre of all its activities. The identification of problems faced by the people is a continuous process and the government takes appropriate action to resolve them from time to time," he said replying to a written question. Lakshadweep has recently seen protests by the locals after the UT administration mooted a number of proposals that include plans to develop the island as a major tourist destination, enactment of the Goonda Act and the plan to restrict the slaughtering of cattle. People also protested over the removal of non-vegetarian items from the menu of midday meals for schoolchildren and closure of dairy farms.

20-07-2021||India||Rajya Sabha proceedings adjourned repeatedly over various issues||Rajya Sabha proceedings were on Tuesday adjourned for the third time amid uproar by YSR Congress members demanding special status for Andhra Pradesh. When the Upper House reconvened at 1 PM after two adjournments, YSR Congress members led by V Vijaysai Reddy trooped in the well shouting slogans, "We want justice. We want special status to Andhra Pradesh." Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh asked protesting members several times to go back to their seats and allow the debate on the Covid-19 pandemic. Leader of the House Piyush Goyal appealed to the protesting members to allow discussion on the important issue that has affected the entire humanity. "I would like to appeal to allow the House to discuss this very important subject that is affecting the whole world today. Entire country is watching us, watching this debate on Covid. Request you to discuss this important matter," he said. Goyal also asked YSR Congress members to share their experience in tackling the pandemic and "give us guidance so that others can also benefit from your experience." However, the protesting members did not yield to the Deputy Chairman's request to keep the House in order and continued shouting standing in the Well.

20-07-2021||India||Congress, CPI demand probe into Pegasus snooping case by Joint Parliamentary Committee||The Congress on Tuesday stepped up its attack on the government over the Pegasus snooping controversy and demanded a probe by a Joint Parliamentary Committee. The Opposition party along with other parties also stalled proceedings of both houses of Parliament while raising the issue. Opposition members raised uproar in both houses and demanded a thorough probe into the charges of snooping on journalists, politicians, ministers, judges and others using Israeli Pegasus spyware. Leaders of various political parties also met before the start of proceedings in both houses of Parliament to decide their strategy on the issue. Several of them had also given adjournment notices in both houses demanding a discussion on the issue. Congress spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil said the government should clearly tell whether it has purchased the Pegasus spyware or not and hold a joint parliamentary probe. "We had given adjournment notices in both Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha to hold a discussion on the violation of national security and the fundamental rights under the Constitution over the phone tapping issue," Gohil told reporters. He said the party's demand is that the government should order a joint parliamentary committee probe into the snooping and phone tapping issue. "The minister, who was trying to create confusion on the matter should answer clearly whether the government has bought the Pegasus spyware or not. If yes, then the government should order a joint parliamentary committee probe to investigate the entire matter," he said. The government on Monday categorically rejected in Lok Sabha allegations of snooping on politicians, journalists and others using Pegasus software, asserting that illegal surveillance was not possible with checks and balances in the country's laws, and alleged that attempts were being made to malign Indian democracy. An international media consortium reported on Sunday that over 300 verified mobile phone numbers, including of two ministers, over 40 journalists, three opposition leaders and one sitting judge besides scores of businesspersons and activists in India could have been targeted for hacking through the spyware. CPI also demands for a JPC probe The CPI has demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the alleged use of Israeli spyware Pegasus for "snooping into number of phones of opposition leaders, journalists, activists and numerous others". In a statement on Tuesday, the party said the people of the country has every right to know the truth in the matter. "The National Secretariat of the Communist Party of India is shocked to learn that Israeli spy software Pegasus has been snooping into number of phones of opposition leaders, journalists, activists and numerous others. "The Modi government is in good relations with the government of Israel. People are questioning how such surveillance can be conducted without the knowledge and consent of the Indian government. Truth therefore should come out," the statement said. The government has said "any sort of illegal surveillance" by unauthorised persons is not possible in India. The CPI also said that the Indian Constitution grants right to privacy to all citizens and the Supreme Court has also upheld this right. "The Modi government since it came to power has been continuously attacking the constitutionally guaranteed rights of citizens and states in order to push its anti-people and anti-federal policies. "The National Secretariat demands a thorough probe into the entire incident by a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) as the people of the country have every right to know the truth," it said. All Opposition parties the Congress, the CPI(M) and the TMC Monday demanded a probe into the issue. An international media consortium reported Sunday that over 300 verified mobile phone numbers, including of two ministers, over 40 journalists, three opposition leaders and one sitting judge besides scores of businesspersons and activists in India could have been targeted for hacking through the spyware.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-415
20-07-2021||India||Congress still believes it has the right to be in power, says Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the Covid crisis is not a political but a humanitarian issue and asserted that the government has ensured no one goes hungry during the pandemic. Such a pandemic has been witnessed by the world after a very very long time, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi quoted the prime minister as telling MPs at the BJP's parliamentary party meeting. The prime minister also said that it was ensured not a single poor person "sleeps" hungry, Joshi told reporters. Modi stressed that despite the pandemic, a huge population got ration, and told BJP MPs that providing relief to the people was their responsibility and not a favour, according to Joshi. He said the prime minister asserted that the pandemic is a humanitarian issue and not a political one. The prime minister expressed concern about the attitude of the Opposition, especially the Congress, and said it still believes, it has the right to be in power, Joshi quoted Modi has saying at the meeting. He also told BJP MPs that the government was willing to hold discussions in both Houses of Parliament, but the opposition was showing a most irresponsible behaviour, Joshi said. Sources said that in the meeting, Modi asked BJP MPs to be effectively counter the allegations of the Opposition about the government's Covid response and the availability of vaccines. He also told the MPs that considering the anticipation of a third wave of the Covid pandemic, they should prepare and be ready to put boots on the ground, the sources said. On the Covid vaccination drive, Modi emphasised that BJP MPs should ensure that the drive in their respective constituencies is carried out without glitches.

20-07-2021||India||Relaxations granted by Kerala govt for Bakrid wholly uncalled for, says SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday termed wholly uncalled for the Kerala government's relaxations for Bakrid in areas with a high Covid positivity rate and said giving in to pressure from traders discloses a sorry state of affairs. Directing the state government to "heed the Right to Life", the apex court also warned Kerala it will take action if the easing of curbs leads to further spread of the virus and this is brought before it by any person. "To give in to pressure groups (of traders) so that the citizenry of India is laid bare to a nationwide pandemic discloses a sorry state of affairs. Even otherwise, assurances from traders and nothing more do not inspire any confidence in the people of India or this court," a bench of Justices R F Nariman and B R Gavai said. "We direct the Kerala government to give heed to Right to Life enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution," it said. The bench was hearing an application raising the issue of the Bakrid relaxations in Kerala. The apex court had last week taken cognisance on its own of media reports on the Uttar Pradesh government's decision to allow the Kanwar Yatra amid the Covid pandemic. The apex court referred to a paragraph in the affidavit filed by the Kerala government and said it disclosed that the state has given in to associations of traders, which made a representation that they have stocked up goods for the purpose of Bakrid. "What is extremely alarming is the fact that in Category D where infection rates are the highest, a full day of relaxation has been granted," it said. "We state that this affidavit discloses a sorry state of affairs as has been stated above and does not in real manner safeguard the Right to Life and Health guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution," it said. "We may also indicate that if as a result of this (relaxations), if any untoward spread of COVID-19 takes place, any member of the public may approach this court after which the court will take action accordingly. The IA is disposed of," the top court said. The bench had on Monday asked the Kerala government to file its response during the day on the application against the three-day relaxation in Covid restrictions in the state in view of Bakrid on Wednesday. In its affidavit filed in the top court, the state has said that curbs and resultant economic slowdown have put the population in a lot of misery. The traders were expecting that the Bakrid sales will alleviate their misery to a certain extent. They have stocked up the goods for this purpose much early. The organisation of traders started to agitate against the stringent curbs implemented in the LSGIs (local self government institutions) and declared that they will open shops all over the state flouting the regulations," the affidavit said. It said the Opposition political parties also raised the traders' issue in public domain and demanded more relaxations in the curbs to give some respite to the traders and to allow some economic activities in the state. "The chief minister held discussion with the organisations and heard their demands on July 16, 2021. The traders assured that the opening of shops will be strictly following COVID protocols and they are ready to follow the additional regulations ordered by the state, if any," it said. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had announced the concessions at a press conference on July 17. In view of Bakrid (Eid-ul-Azha) being celebrated on July 21, textiles, footwear shops, jewellery, fancy stores, shops selling home appliances and electronic items, all types of repairing shops and shops selling essential items shall be allowed to open on July 18-20 from 7 AM to 8 PM in category A, B and C areas, he said. In D category areas, these shops can function only on July 19, he had said. The areas have been categorised based on test positivity rates. On Monday, the top court closed the matter related to the Kanwar Yatra in Uttar Pradesh and asked the authorities to ensure that any untoward incident directly affecting the lives of the public shall be looked upon sternly and prompt action would be taken immediately.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-415
20-07-2021||India||Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha adjourned as Opposition raises Pegasus snooping controversy||The Lok Sabha was adjourned till 2 pm while the Rajya Sabha halted its proceedings till 12 noon and then 1 pm on Tuesday as Opposition MPs disrupted proceedings over the Pegasus snooping controversy as well as other issues. Opposition members sought to raise various issues and shouted slogans as soon as the Lower House met for the day at 11 am. The proceedings lasted for barely five minutes. Members of Opposition parties at Rajya Sabha, who had given as many as 15 notices under rule 267 requiring setting aside of the business of the day to take up the issue they want to raise, raised slogans and rushed into the Well of the House, prompting chairman M Venkaiah Naidu to adjourn the proceedings till 12 noon at first. Soon after the session convened at 12 noon, it was further stalled till 1 pm. The issues include alleged snooping of Opposition leaders, journalists and vocal critics of the government, fuel price rise and farmers agitation against new farm laws.No sooner had the House condoled the death of a former member, Ramadhar Kashyap, members of Congress, TMC, Left and DMK were up on their feet raising various issues. With the chairman disallowing all the 15 notices as he did for the 17 served on Monday, Anand Sharma of tghe Congress said either the rule 267 should be removed or the Chairman should consider notices given under them as long as it is there in the rule book. "These are issues of concern. We should not only read about it in newspapers or see on television," he said. Naidu said he agrees with Sharma. "There is a need for (rule) 267. I have been there in the House and I understand the problem of national security, something serious happens, you have to suspend the business and then take up that matter." But this provided the Chairman goes through the notice and then admits it, he said adding the notices given on Monday and Tuesday largely relate to "variety of issues... some of them ongoing for a long time, some of them discussed earlier." "What is the way for the Chairman to admit 15 267 notices and take the house forward," he remarked adding zero hour is the time when members can raise issues on which they have given notices. But Opposition members were not convinced and started to rush into the Well as Naidu called for listed official papers to be laid on the table. As they raised slogans, Naidu adjourned the proceedings. "The House is adjourned to meet at 12 noon because some people have decided not to allow the House (to function)," he remarked during the initial session. The leaders will meet at 2 pm to decide if they will attend the meeting on Covid called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at 6 pm, reports ndtv.com. The list of the potential Indian targets of a snooping operation that deploys Israeli spyware accessible only to government agencies covers citizens in every sphere that is expected to act as a check and balance in a democracy, suggests information revealed on Monday by a media collective that includes The Wire news portal and The Washington Post and The Guardian newspapers. Rahul Gandhi, Prashant Kishor, IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw were some of the big names revealed as potential targets of the Israeli spyware.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-415

20-07-2021||India||BMS urges Modi to convene Indian Labour Conference at the earliest||The RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) on Monday lamented that the Indian Labour Conference (ILC) has not met since 2015 while the country is confronted with burning issues like job loss and marginalisation of women workers. The ILC is the apex tripartite body comprising representatives of employees, employers and the government to discuss emerging labour issues in the country and advise the government on such issues. All the 12 central trade unions are members of the ILC which has been meeting every year since 1942 except breaks in some years. The last meeting was held in 2015. BMS general secretary Binoy Kumar Sinha has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging to take steps to hold the ILC at the earliest “to uphold the noble tradition of tripartism in the country”. The letter said India being a founding member of the International Labour Organisation, the labour arm of United Nations, has traditionally upheld the high ideals of tripartism. The Indian Parliament has ratified the ILO Convention related to strengthening tripartite mechanism. The ILC has been meeting since 1942. In 1957, the ILC laid down the scientific criteria for fixing minimum wages, it said. From 1997, the Prime Minister has been attending the inaugural event of the ILC. Modi had attended the event in 2015. “For various reasons, for the last 6 years, ILC was not held, while the country was confronted with many burning issues related to labour. Today several burning issues like that of migrant workers, labour law reforms, informal sector workers, contract workers in the formal sector, loss of jobs and wage reduction during the pandemic, social security, increasing  marginalisation of women workers, etc, are all matters of high concern for the workers in India,” Sinha wrote. “Hence, we would like to request you to take steps to convene the ILC at the earliest, honouring it with your presence...,” he wrote. Pawan Kumar, north zone secretary of the BMS, said that the Prime Minister listens to workers to get feedback from working class. “Where shall the workers go to raise their issues if the ILC is not held? The PM should honour the tripartite mechanism,” Kumar said. He said the BMS recently held protests in Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh over the burning issues like lack of social security for workers, delay in implementation of wage and social security law and delay in implementing a database for migrant workers.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-415

Days before, Indian targets had started being selected,” the UK newspaper said. The picture above was tweeted by Netanyahu in July 2017, showing him and Modi on the beach in Haifa. “There’s nothing like going to the beach with friends!” Netanyahu had tweeted. The spyware Pegasus, which allows customers to infiltrate mobile phones and monitor messages, camera feeds and microphones, is made and licensed by the Israeli company NSO, which has denied any wrongdoing. NSO said its product was intended only for use by vetted government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to fight terrorism and crime. The new allegations may escalate concerns that the Israeli government has abetted government abuses by granting NSO an export licence to sell software to countries that use it to suppress dissent. The Guardian has underlined that India does not officially admit to being an NSO customer, a significant hurdle to challenging the use of the spyware in court.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-416
20-07-2021||India||Pegasus: Congress seeks probe on Modi, ouster of Shah||⚫ Rahul Gandhi, the Congress spearhead in the 2019 general election. ⚫ Ashok Lavasa, the election commissioner who wanted Narendra Modi held accountable for his intemperate speeches on the 2019 Lok Sabha election campaign trail. ⚫ A woman and her family after she complained of sexual harassment by Ranjan Gogoi, the then Chief Justice of India who presided over some of the most important cases in independent India, including that dealing with the Ayodhya land and the Rafale fighter plane deal. ⚫ Abhishek Banerjee, Trinamul leader, and Prashant Kishor, the party’s poll consultant. The latter in the middle of the Bengal Assembly elections and even as recently as this month when he met Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in the capital. ⚫ Two Union ministers, including new information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. ⚫ Virologist Gagandeep Kang (in 2018), who had recently questioned some aspects of the government’s Covid management. ⚫ Dozens of journalists, including one who was covering the Rafale controversy. ⚫ Several civil rights defenders and academics. The list of the potential Indian targets of a snooping operation that deploys Israeli spyware accessible only to government agencies covers citizens in every sphere that is expected to act as a check and balance in a democracy, suggests information revealed on Monday by a media collective that includes The Wire news portal and The Washington Post and The Guardian newspapers. The Congress described the government’s alleged surveillance of critics and opponents through the Israeli spyware as “treason” and an “inexcusable breach of national security”, and demanded the immediate sacking of home minister Amit Shah and an independent investigation into the role of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The party described as a “lie” the government’s claim that it had not snooped on anyone, after the media reports suggested surveillance of Opposition leaders like Rahul, a few BJP politicians who are now central ministers, journalists and activists. The Congress underlined that the Israeli company NSO states that its products “are used exclusively by government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to fight crime and terror”. “Are politicians, journalists, human rights activists, lawyers and Modi’s own ministers terrorists? Why were they spied on? No government ever stooped so low,” party communications chief Randeep Surjewala said at a news conference held jointly with the Congress leaders of both Houses of Parliament, Mallikarjun Kharge and Adhir Chowdhury. “Is spying on leaders of the Opposition, heads of security forces, election commissioner, members of the judiciary, ministers, journalists and activists through a foreign entity’s spyware not treason and an inexcusable breach of national security?” Surjewala said. “Who in the Government of India purchased and deployed the illegal spyware Pegasus? Who authorised the purchase? How many hundred or thousand crores were spent?” The Congress underlined that the government had admitted snooping via Pegasus in Parliament on November 28, 2019, contrary to Monday’s denial of spying by new information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. “Should home minister Amit Shah not be sacked forthwith? Does this not warrant a full investigation of the role of the Prime Minister?” Surjewala said. Both Kharge and Adhir said Shah should be sacked if the government had any pretensions to morality. Two numbers used by Rahul were allegedly among the potential targets. Rahul gave up those numbers after WhatsApp alerted him about possible hacking. Several members of Rahul’s social circles and office staff too were allegedly put under surveillance. The Wire reported that the phone number of IT minister Vaishnaw was among the potential targets between 2017 and 2019. Minister Prahlad Singh Patel’s name also figures in the list. Former finance minister and Congress veteran P. Chidambaram contested Vaishnaw’s claim, made in the Lok Sabha on Monday, that illegal snooping was impossible in India. “NSO Group, the owner of Pegasus, has said that NSO sells its technologies solely to law enforcement and intelligence agencies of vetted governments. It is unfortunate that minister Vaishnaw has started his innings on the wrong foot,” Chidambaram said. “In his statement, the minister has omitted to quote the crucial part of Pegasus’s statement. The services that are ‘openly available to anyone, anywhere, and anytime’ refer to HLR Lookup services, not to Pegasus. The minister should answer a simple question: Did the government acquire the Pegasus software/ spyware?” The Congress and other Opposition parties plan to jointly raise the matter during the ongoing session of Parliament. On Monday, the Congress released a report by Cert-In, a department under the IT ministry, that had on May 17, 2019, said: “A vulnerability has been reported in WhatsApp which could be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.” The party also recalled that then IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said in the Rajya Sabha on November 28, 2019, that the hacking of 121 telephones had been reported and a notice issued to NSO. “The NSO Group had written to Citizen Lab (of the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto) stating clearly that ‘Our product is licensed to government and law enforcement agencies for the sole purpose of investing and preventing crime and terror’,” Surjewala said. “It is thus clear that the Government of India and its agencies bought the spyware. It could neither be bought nor deployed by any private operator. The Citizen Lab submitted a report on September 18, 2018, saying the Pegasus software was used to target politicians in India.” Surjewala added: “The Citizen Lab report said, ‘Our research continues to demonstrate some highly concerning real-world examples of the abuse of NSO Group technology in practice. These uses have included apparent government customers of NSO Group abusing Pegasus spyware to target civil society groups, human rights defenders, lawyers, politicians and journalists’.” He added: “The Pegasus spyware has infected a number of telephone/ Internet providers, including the National Internet Backbone (NIC) and MTNL. It gives a brief list of the infected Internet providers: Bharti Airtel Limited, MTNL, NIC, Hathway Cable Internet, Star Broadband Services, Atria Convergence Technologies Private Limited.” Surjewala said Indian citizens should realise that the government was spying on their daughters, sons and wives by murdering privacy and the rule of law. Rahul taunted the Prime Minister for “reading everything on your phone”. Virologist Kang was a potential target in 2018 while tackling the Nipah infection. “In 2018, Kang was helping with aspects of the response to an outbreak of the deadly Nipah virus in the southern Indian state of Kerala. She urged Indian health officials to share blood samples of those infected with a global initiative to develop vaccines against future pandemics, an effort that was ultimately fruitless,” The Washington Post said. On the woman who accused Justice Gogoi of sexual harassment, The Wire reported that she “recorded her allegations in a sworn affidavit on April 20, 2019, and was marked as a person of interest just days after this, an analysis of a leaked list of phone numbers accessed by French media non-profit Forbidden Stories reveals”. The leaked records show that eight other phone numbers belonging to her husband and two of his brothers were also marked as possible candidates for surveillance in the same week, when her allegations against the CJI were first reported, the portal said. “All told, a total of 11 numbers associated with the complainant and her family were selected, making them among the largest cluster of associated phone numbers in the India-leg of the Pegasus Project, a special investigation coordinated by Forbidden Stories and 16 international media partners with the assistance of Amnesty International’s technical team,” The Wire added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-416
20-07-2021||India||Elgaar case: Pegasus exposé raises unjust detention cry||The families of the Elgaar Parishad-Maoist links detainees and one of their lawyers have said the new revelations about targeted surveillance have vindicated their stand that the prolonged imprisonment of the 15 surviving accused is unjust. An international exposé of the use of the spyware Pegasus — developed by Israeli company NSO and sold only to governments — has found that the mobile numbers of several Elgaar Parishad accused were on a list of those selected for surveillance by an unidentified client of NSO. Such “tampering”, the relatives of the Elgaar accused say, strengthens the suspicion that the “evidence” against the detainees was planted on their electronic devices — as already suggested by American digital forensics firm Arsenal Consulting in the case of two accused. Among the surveillance targets named by the exposé are academics Hany Babu MT, Vernon Gonsalves, Anand Teltumbde and Shoma Sen; activists Gautam Navlakha and Rona Wilson; and lawyers Arun Ferreira and Sudha Bharadwaj. The numbers of several relatives and suspected associates of the Elgaar detainees too were on the list. They include: “Varavara Rao’s daughter Pavana; lawyer Surendra Gadling’s wife Minal Gadling, his associate lawyers Nihalsingh Rathod and Jagadish Meshram, one of his former clients Maruti Kurwatkar, who was charged in multiple cases under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), incarcerated for over four years and later released on bail; Bharadwaj’s lawyer Shalini Gera; Teltumbde’s friend Jaison Cooper, a Kerala-based rights activist; scholar of the Naxalite movement and Bastar-based lawyer Bela Bhatia; one of the oldest members of the Kabir Kala Manch cultural group Rupali Jadhav; and tribal rights activist Mahesh Raut’s close associate and lawyer Lalsu Nagoti,” a report in The Wire news website, which participated in the exposé, said. Gonsalves’s wife Susan Abraham — who is also a lawyer for Sen, Teltumbde and two fellow detainees: author Sudhir Dhawale and the Kabir Kala Manch’s Jyoti Jagtap — told The Telegraph: “It is absolutely shocking that this should have happened and must still be happening. Of course, this has led to Vernon’s arrest and continued incarceration for almost three years now without a trial. This is completely unlawful and unjust. This form of surveillance web that we all are trapped in must be snapped.” Earlier this year, Arsenal had found that “evidence” had been planted on the computers of Delhi-based activist Wilson and Nagpur-based lawyer Gadling, both of whom are in a Navi Mumbai jail awaiting trial in the case. However, both the National Investigating Agency (NIA) and the Maharashtra police have opposed Wilson’s plea to Bombay High Court to quash the case. The NIA told the court that “documents which are not part of the chargesheet cannot be relied upon”, while the state police argued in court earlier this month that the accused can challenge the evidence only when it comes to trial. Babu’s wife Jenny Rowena, who teaches at Delhi University, told this newspaper: “It shows how unsafe our devices are and how unethical the government is in tampering with them. Yet, the courts have taken the documents found in the laptops of the accused as prima facie evidence. The Arsenal report shows (the computers have been) tampered with and in the light of these disclosures we must take it for granted that the government can tamper with our devices. “The courts must refuse to take the documents in the computers of the accused in this case as prima facie evidence and give them bail as soon as possible without us having to prove (the purported evidence) is fake after years of incarceration, as it happens in UAPA cases.” Last year, rights group Amnesty International and the University of Toronto’s Internet watchdog Citizen Lab had revealed that in 2019, a coordinated spyware operation was used to target at least nine human rights defenders, eight of whom are campaigning for the release of the Elgaar case accused. Also in 2019, Pegasus was discovered to have been used to spy on human rights defenders by penetrating their mobile phones via WhatsApp. Teltumbde’s wife Rama Ambedkar-Teltumbde — who happens to be B.R. Ambedkar’s granddaughter — told this newspaper: “We already knew of his devices being compromised with Pegasus through Citizen Lab way back in 2019. The new stories certainly expose a great threat in today’s India against dissenters and the very fabric of our Constitution at large. It is strange that on one hand the Arsenal report is being dismissed for being foreign, but we (are using) foreign technology to snoop on our own countrymen.” Navlakha was also grilled in the money-laundering case against investigative portal Newsclick. His partner Sahba Husain said: “First he was arrested (in the Elgaar case), now this ED case is also being brought…. When so much material shows planting of proof and surveillance, why does the government not investigate if they are not afraid…. Not just the Centre, but even the Maharashtra government said ‘no’ to the Arsenal evidence in the high court. They should have ordered a special investigation team probe.” The NIA reports to the central government, which is under the BJP. Maharashtra has a coalition government of the Shiv Sena, NCP and the Congress. The home department is helmed by an NCP minister, with a minister of state each from the Congress and the Sena. Sahba Husain said: “The lives, liberty and families of those in jail are being made to suffer. Six of them got Covid; some went to hospital and one died…. This is complete lawlessness. It is only those behind bars who are abiding by the law. Our only hope now is the judiciary.” Varavara’s daughter P. Pavana said: “In 2019, WhatsApp told me that my phone had been hacked. As the daughter of an activist, I have known there is surveillance on us. But today, even ministers and an election commissioner — basically anyone who does not have exactly the same opinion as the people at the top — are being spied upon. This is clearly an attack on democracy.” She added: “The response of the ministers in Parliament almost accepts the charge (of spying). They could have merely ordered an inquiry but no, like in other cases they want to make the victims out as the accused. In (the Elgaar Parishad case), those who spoke in favour of the victims are now accused of the violence. Be it the Delhi riots or the attack on JNU — the victims are booked by the police.” Several academics, lawyers, rights activists and writers have been arrested or interrogated in an investigation into the alleged Maoist links to an Ambedkarite event — the Elgaar Parishad — on December 31, 2017, that was followed the next day by caste clashes that claimed one life. One of the accused, Parkinson’s-stricken Father Stan Swamy, died of multiple ailments that his friends and supporters have blamed on poor treatment of a Covid infection he had contracted in jail. The case expanded into a purge of “urban Naxals”, a term used by Right-wing commentators for people they accuse of clandestinely working for the banned CPI Maoist. The case was transferred from Maharashtra police to the NIA soon after the BJP lost power in the state. The France-based Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International’s Security Lab have accessed records of the NSO Group. These were analysed by The Wire news website in partnership with 15 other global media outlets. The investigation led to the exposé.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-416
20-07-2021||India||Pegasus snoop: Can India do to culprits what US did to Nixon? ||The Pegasus “snoop” without any gates is making Watergate look like an amateur operation as far as the modus operandi — remote break-in now and burglary-style break-in then — is concerned. But a big “IF” comes into play on whether India will be able to hold accountable those responsible as America did by compelling Richard Nixon to give up the presidency half a century ago. For one, India does not have a provision for impeachment of the head of government, the threat of which had forced Nixon to step down. As head of government in India, the Prime Minister can be forced to resign only if he or she loses their majority on the floor of the Lok Sabha. That is a tall ask in contemporary India, given the brute majority the BJP has in the House. But Nixon had also used the full weight of his office — the most powerful in the free world — to fight the evidence against him. The collective effort to hold Nixon accountable succeeded because the media, judiciary and the legislature did their job. That is the question that will confront India now: will its media, judiciary and legislature do what they are supposed to do? Prime Minister Narendra Modi is no stranger to snooping scandals, having weathered the storm over a controversy in his home state of Gujarat as chief minister. And, the initial response of the government has been to brazen it out. Where the current controversy over the use of Pegasus spyware is similar to Watergate is in the expanse of the snooping. From all indications, a large number of journalists, politicians — including some from the ruling party — as well as members of the judiciary and activists have been a target of this spyware-enabled hacking. The Washington Post investigated both scandals. However, it was a singular enterprise for the newspaper on Watergate, unlike with Pegasus where it is part of a collective of media houses across the globe probing the use of the Israeli spyware by various governments. In the Watergate scandal, Nixon and his aides were found guilty of extensive wiretapping that involved breaking into the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) headquarters in the Watergate Office Building, Washington DC, to bug the premises, and the President himself recording all the telephone conversations in his office. The Watergate scandal began with the police apprehending five burglars for a break-in at the DNC headquarters in Washington DC on June 17, 1972. Four of the five were former CIA operatives and the fifth was part of the organisation working for Nixon’s re-election. Later, it transpired that there were parallel efforts to spy on the headquarters of the Democratic nominee for the presidential elections that year. An elaborate cover-up ensued, and Nixon ordered the FBI to scale down the probe. Throughout the election campaign, Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein were provided leaks by FBI deputy director W. Mark Felt though his name became public only three decades later. Through the scandal and for much later he went by the pseudonym Deep Throat. Barring The Washington Post, the scandal was largely ignored by the American media during the run-up to the 1972 presidential polls. The trial of the five accused and two accomplices began a fortnight before Nixon’s second inauguration. Again, the White House was able to contain the scandal but the presiding judge, John J. Sirica, was unrelenting in following the money. As the sentencing date approached, the Senate set up a special investigating committee on abuses in the 1972 presidential campaign. From here on, the judiciary and legislature leveraged the two proceedings to corner the Nixon administration, resulting in television networks broadcasting the committee hearings without ad breaks. What was revealed was extensive wire-tapping by the Nixon administration and the establishment of a money-laundering operation to fund its favoured Senate candidates. The proverbial nail in the coffin came when Alexander P. Butterfield, a former White House staffer, disclosed that all conversations in the President’s offices had been secretly recorded on tape. The judiciary ordered Nixon to hand over the tapes. He contested it tooth and nail, offering to provide transcripts instead, but fell in line in the face of public protest. With the entire can of worms spilling out, the House Judiciary Committee initiated the impeachment enquiry in May 1974, almost two years after the DNC burglary. Nixon resigned three months later as the full scale of the cover-up by him became evident. Ultimately, it was the provision of checks and balances in a democracy and the combined efforts of the three other pillars of democracy – the media, judiciary and the legislature – that brought the President of the United States down.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-416
20-07-2021||India||Parliament monsoon session : Modi criticises 'negative mindset' ||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said Parliament had never seen such a “negative mindset” as protests by the Opposition members obstructed him from introducing his new  ministers, forgetting that the BJP was the first to do so in 2004 when as the principal Opposition party, it hadn’t allowed then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to fulfil the tradition. As the monsoon session commenced, the Opposition shouted slogans in protest against price rise, Covid mishandling and the farmers’ issue, and stalled proceedings of both Houses of Parliament. As the din obstructed Modi from introducing the ministers in both Houses, he accused the Opposition of being “anti-women, anti-Dalit, anti-tribal and anti-OBC”. Senior minister Rajnath Singh claimed such a thing had never happened in Parliament and accused the Congress of setting an “unhealthy tradition”. “In my 24 years of parliamentary life, I have never seen a single instance when the Prime Minister was not allowed to introduce his ministers,” Rajnath told the Lok Sabha. “What the Congress did is extremely sad, unfortunate and unhealthy,” he added, as protests by the Opposition members continued. A little after Modi and Rajnath spoke in the House, Sanjaya Baru, who was media adviser to then Prime Minister Singh, tweeted a picture of a page from his book, Accidental Prime Minister, exposing the lie. “UPA’s first Parliament session began on a rocky note. From the Prime Minister’s point of view, it was a sad note. For the first time in parliamentary history, a newly elected Prime Minister was neither allowed to introduce his council of ministers to Parliament nor given the privilege of replying to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President for his address to Parliament,” said the page from Baru’s book on Singh. The BJP, as principal Opposition in 2004, hadn’t allowed Singh to introduce the ministers of his new government, protesting against the induction of Lalu Prasad and Shibu Soren. It’s a tradition that the Prime Minister introduces his council of ministers whenever a new government is formed or an expansion takes place.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-416
20-07-2021||India||Supreme Court frees Manipur activist detained under NSA||The Supreme Court on Monday directed that a Manipur activist detained under the National Security Act for a Facebook post that said cow urine and cow dung do not cure Covid be released by 5pm on Monday on interim bail. Erendro Leichobam had been held in Manipur on May 13 for posting the comment following the death of state BJP chief S. Tikendra Singh. “We are of the view that the continued detention of the petitioner... would amount to a violation of the right to life and personal liberty,” the bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah said. “We accordingly direct that the petitioner shall be released forthwith as and by way of an interim direction of this court, unless he is required to be in custody in any other case, subject to further orders, subject to his filing a personal release bond in the amount of Rs 1,000.” The order added: “The respondents shall comply with the order of this court on or before 5pm today. The registrar (judicial) shall communicate a copy of this order forthwith to the Manipur central jail, Sajiwa.” Erendro’s lawyer Shadan Farasat told The Telegraph the activist had been released at 4.45pm. “Yes, he has been released already around 4.45pm,” Farasat said. Earlier on Monday, the court had rejected solicitor-general Tushar Mehta’s plea that the case be taken up on Tuesday. On Tuesday, the bench will take up the larger issue of the NSA — which allows preventive detention for up to 12 months on grounds of national security and public order — being invoked against Erendro, convener of the political outfit Peoples’ Resurgence and Justice Alliance. The bench is dealing with a petition moved by Erendro’s father Raghumani Singh challenging his son’s detention and seeking contempt action against the Manipur chief secretary, state police chief and the Imphal West district magistrate. The petition highlights that Erendro was arrested despite the apex court’s April 20 order saying citizens shall not be subjected to criminal cases or arrested for airing their views on social media relating to the Covid crisis. Raghumani has also filed a habeas corpus petition seeking his son’s production before the top court. He has underlined that despite Erendro being granted bail on May 17 in a case booked under penal code sections, he was rearrested straightaway on the orders of the district magistrate under the NSA. Erendro’s May 13 post had expressed condolences for Tikendra’s death and said: “The cure for Corona is not cow dung & cow urine. The cure is science & common sense. Professor ji RIP.” The context was several BJP politicians’ public claims about cow dung and cow urine curing or preventing Covid. “Bolstered by such advice from leading political members, there were reports of people smearing cow dung and drinking cow urine to cure corona. In fact, in some places proper units were established which took to treating people with coronavirus using cow dung and cow urine,” Raghumani’s petition says. The petition underlines the lack of scientific evidence for the claims made on behalf of cow urine and cow dung, and says the Facebook post was not meant to hurt religious sentiments. Several FIRs were lodged against Erendro’s post in various Manipur police stations by BJP workers, including state unit vice-president Usham Deben. The penal code sections invoked against Erendro are 153A (promoting enmity between groups), 505b(2) (public mischief), 295A (outraging religious sentiments), 503 (criminal intimidation) and 504 (breach of peace). If convicted, he can be jailed for up to three years. A journalist, Kishorechandra Wangkhem, too was arrested on May 13 for a similar post and rearrested on May 17 under the NSA following the grant of bail.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-416
20-07-2021||India||Pegasus:  Amit Shah questions the timing of the leak||Union home minister Amit Shah, under attack from the Opposition on Monday over an explosive report on the alleged phone-tapping of prominent personalities in the country using Israeli spyware Pegasus, called it “a report by the disrupters for the obstructers”. He questioned the timing of the leak and said it was done to create disruptions on the first day of the monsoon session of Parliament. Shah also used his much controversial phrase “Aap chronology samjhiye” to counter criticism of the government over the Pegasus reports. “People have often associated this phrase with me in the lighter vein, but today I want to seriously say — the timing of the selective leaks, the disruptions… Aap chronology samjhiye! This is a report by the disrupters for the obstructers,” he said in a statement. “Disrupters are global organisations which do not like India to progress. Obstructers are political players in India who do not want India to progress. People of India are very good at understanding this chronology and connection,” he added. An international media consortium had on Sunday reported that more than 300 verified mobile phone numbers, including that of two serving ministers, over 40 journalists, three Opposition leaders and one sitting judge besides scores of businessmen and activists in India, could have been targeted for hacking through an Israeli spyware sold only to government agencies. The Wire, a digital news platform, on Monday reported that senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, election strategist Prashant Kishor, former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa, ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw and Prahlad Patel, TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee and the entire family of a Supreme Court staffer who had accused the then Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi of sexual harassment in 2019 were among those whose phones were either breached or were listed as potential targets by Israeli company NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. Without naming Pegasus, the home minister said: “The facts and sequence of events are for the entire nation to see. Today the monsoon session of Parliament has started. In what seemed like a perfect cue, late last evening we saw a report, which has been amplified by a few sections with only one aim — to do whatever is possible and humiliate India at the world stage, peddle the same old narratives about our nation and derail India’s development trajectory.” Shah also slammed the Congress for the uproar in Parliament on Monday and accused the party of “trying to derail anything progressive that comes up in Parliament”. “Just a few days ago the council of ministers was expanded with great emphasis given to women, SC, ST and OBC members. But there are forces unable to digest this. They also want to derail national progress. This merits the question — to whose tune are these people dancing, who want to keep showing India in poor light? What pleasure do they get to show India in bad light time and again?” Shah said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-416
20-07-2021||India||Pegasus : IT minister says use of data did not amount to surveillance||New information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Monday told the Lok Sabha that use of data didn’t amount to surveillance, reacting to allegations that the Centre had snooped on opponents and critics using the Israeli spyware Pegasus. His predecessor Ravi Shankar Prasad wondered at a media briefing why India alone was being put in the dock when 45 nations were using Pegasus, thus appearing to acknowledge that the Narendra Modi government had used the spyware. Vaishnaw told the House: “It is also beyond doubt that the data has nothing to do with surveillance or NSO (the Israeli company that developed Pegasus), so there can be no factual basis to suggest that use of the data somehow equates to surveillance.” He added: “Any form of illegal surveillance is not possible with the checks and balances in our laws and our robust institutions.” The minister was making a statement on the controversy over a global investigative project that has claimed that Pegasus was used to snoop on more than 300 mobile phones in India. A fresh list released on Monday by the international exposé suggests that even Vaishnaw had been selected as a potential surveillance target in 2017. The Centre has so far evaded any direct reply to the specific question whether it had purchased the Pegasus spyware from NSO. Relying heavily on NSO’s statement, Vaishnaw termed the investigative report a conspiracy to malign India’s democracy while denying any unauthorised snooping by the government. Prasad seemed to indirectly admit government use of Pegasus but sought to deny it when asked directly. “Isiliye, yeh sawal phir relevant hota hai, ki jab 45 se adhik desh Pegasus ka upyog kar rahe hain, jaisa ki NSO ne bataya hai, toh sirf Bharat ko hi target kyon kiya jaa raha hai (Therefore, the question again becomes relevant that when more than 45 countries are using Pegasus, as NSO has said, why is India alone being targeted)?” Prasad said. Recently sacked as law, IT and communications minister, Prasad had been fielded to attack those using the Pegasus controversy to corner the government. Asked directly whether his party’s government at the Centre used the Pegasus spyware, Prasad first sought to avoid a direct reply. On being pressed, he said: “We have never said that we use (Pegasus).” He added that there was a foolproof legal framework for phone-tapping and that the government never breaks it. Put on the defensive by the international exposé, the government tried to play victim, alleging a design to defame it. “Is this some kind of revenge for the way India handled Covid, the way 75 per cent of the people are getting free vaccines and the way India’s global clout has increased under Prime Minister Modi?” Prasad asked. Vaishnaw said: “It can’t be a mere coincidence that this report has been leaked by a portal on the eve of the monsoon session.” Home minister Amit Shah said in a statement: “This is a report by the disrupters for the obstructers. Disrupters are global organisations that do not like India to progress. Obstructers are political players in India who do not want India to progress.” He said the people of India were very good at “understanding this chronology and connection”.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-416
20-07-2021||India||Denied football by global warming, on track to Tokyo ||Global warming has helped pave Alex Antony’s path to the Tokyo Olympics. Now the 26-year-old member of India’s mixed 4x400m relay team hopes his accomplishment would help highlight the misery his fishing community in Kerala has suffered from global warming, made worse by the human hand. Alex was just a boy when climate change inflicted its first wound on him. Born to an impoverished fishing family at Pulluvila on Thiruvananthapuram’s outskirts, Alex’s burning ambition was to become a footballer. He would play all day on the Irayimman Thura Purayidam beach that made up his front yard, and practise running every morning and evening. But by the time he was 10, “accretion” of the beach — the accumulation of a kind of sediment — had turned it into a vast, soggy area unfit for football. Alex’s dreams were wrecked. “I was crazy about football and it was extremely painful. But my teacher (at the PKS Higher Secondary School, Kadinamkulam) boosted my morale and convinced me about the possibilities of athletics,” Alex said. A. Bijukumar, ocean expert and head of the department of aquatic biology and fisheries at the University of Kerala, explained that these sediments were rocks, soil, clay and sand from other shores and beaches. The sea erodes its shores during some months, especially the turbulent monsoon months, and returns the same volume of sediment to the same shore after a few months. But global warming as well as breakwaters or any other huge constructions in the sea can alter the wind and wave patterns and cause the sediments to be deposited in other parts. In Thiruvananthapuram, sea erosion is happening north of Vizhinjam and accretion in Pulluvila to the south. The accretion increased after the construction of a 600m breakwater at the Vizhinjam fishing harbour, 7km north of Pulluvila. It worsened when about 800m of the proposed 3,000m breakwater of the Adani International Sea Port project came up in Vizhinjam. The accretion raised the edge of the Pulluvila beach by about 40 metres, preventing rainwater from flowing into the sea and turning the area swampy. It did not just stop Alex from playing football; the huge pools of accumulated water prevented the mooring of boats and the drying of fishing nets. The elevation of the beach made it difficult for the 600 fishing families to put their boats out to sea. Alex’s father Antony and younger brother Anil shifted their fishing operations to the Chettuva fishing harbour in Thrissur district, 287km away. The duo took turns to travel to Chettuva to keep the home fires burning. While poverty forced Anil to drop out of school and start helping his father, Alex continued his education at the Lio XIIIth Upper Primary School at Pulluvila and then at the Kadinamkulam school. There, physical education teacher Pradip handed Alex a pair of boots and a tracksuit and advised him to focus on athletics, using the school ground for practice. It changed the boy’s life. “We feel guilty for never being able to meet any of his training needs. His teachers helped him emotionally and financially,” Alex’s mother Sarjin, who dries small fish in the sun to buttress the family income, said. “He discontinued his degree course at the Sree Narayana College in Chempazhanthy in the second year because we could not meet the expenses. It was then that Sports Authority of India coach Nishad Kumar realised his potential and began training him.” Alex’s sports quota job with the Indian Air Force in Punjab came as a big respite for the family. His sister Anisha was married off recently. “Alex and his family have been bearing the brunt of climate change for a long time. Cyclone Tauktae, which devastated Kerala’s coasts in May, caused his small, old house to collapse,” said Joseph Vijayan, a scholar and a defender of coastal communities’ rights in the Thiruvananthapuram region. “Now the family lives in a relative’s house. Alex has taken a bank loan to renovate the badly damaged house.” Vijayan said about 65 per cent of Kerala’s coastline was eroded and 25 per cent faced accretion. Sandy beaches, which make up more than 90 per cent of Kerala’s 580km coastline, are more prone to erosion and accretion. Port areas in other states, including eastern Paradip in Odisha, too are facing accretion. But in Kerala, the unscientific construction of huge breakwaters and sea walls has aggravated the situation. Experts say erosion has increased to the north of the Rs 7,525-crore seaport being built by Adani and accretion to its south. K.V. Thomas, a scientist with the National Centre for Earth Science Studies, said the erosion-accretion in the Vizhinjam region would worsen, even posing challenges to the local airport and the Indian Space Research Organisation establishments in Veli and Thumba, because of the constructions related to the port. “Unfortunately, neither the environmental nor livelihood impacts of the project have been assessed sufficiently or accurately. The port is irresponsibly situated in the erosion-prone coast of Thiruvananthapuram,” Thomas said. “Several studies say the Vizhinjam coastline is not geared to withstand the potential impacts of the construction and operation of the mega port.” As for Alex, he could never hope to be an Olympian, surely, had the accretion not forced him off football and into athletics? “Yes, it was a blessing in disguise. I never thought I would represent my motherland in the Olympics,” Alex, speaking from Punjab, said. “It’s a matter of pride as I come from a family that experienced impoverishment at regular intervals. More than my future and career, I hope this opportunity helps me improve the conditions of my family.” But Alex has a bigger concern too. “My village faces an existential crisis. I hope my participation in the Olympics helps put a larger spotlight on the problems of fish workers south of Vizhinjam.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-416
20-07-2021||India||Centre passes onus of dealing with rising private school fee to states ||The central government on Monday shifted the onus of dealing with the demand for a reduction in private school fees amid a drop in parents’ income during the pandemic to the states and Union Territories. In a written reply to an unstarred question in the Lok Sabha, education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the majority of schools, colleges and universities were under the domain of the state governments. “The subject matter of reduction of fee is within the purview of States/UTs,” said the written reply by Pradhan. “Education being in the concurrent list of the Constitution and majority of the schools, colleges and university are under the domain of respective State and UT Governments,” the reply added. Ashok Agrawal, president of All India Parents Association and a member of Delhi University court, said the association had written to the Centre to bring a legislation to provide relief to parents who had come under stress because of joblessness and a decline in income. Agrawal, a practising lawyer, said the central government was very much empowered to bring a legislation in Parliament. “The minister’s response that the subject of reduction of fee is under the purview of the state governments is wrong. Education being a concurrent subject, the central government has powers to bring a law. But this government does not want to bring any law on the fee issue because it wants to promote privatisation and profiteering by schools,” Agrawal said. He said the fees should be collected to pay teachers and staff and for basic maintenance during the pandemic. He said several states had enacted laws to regulate school fees, but they had inherent flaws, which failed to provide any relief to the public. “About 10 states have enacted laws on fee regulation, but none of these laws have any provision to reduce the fee during the pandemic,” Agrawal said. For instance, the law on fee regulation by Maharashtra, in force since 2011, says the demand for reduction would be considered only if 25 per cent of parents complain about high fee. “In many schools, parents do not have any union and fail to raise the issue. So the Maharashtra law is ineffective. Therefore, the central government must bring a law and rules to take care of these loopholes in state laws and ensure parents gets relief,” Agrawal said. Several states have asked private schools to not charge development and annual fees from students as the schools were closed to contain the spread of Covid-19. However, following court orders, schools in states such as Rajasthan and Delhi have started charging both the fees with 15 per cent reduction. They are also charging for arrears for some fees that had been waived last year. As a result, the fees have suddenly increased by 40 to 50 per cent in private schools in both the states, adding to the stress of parents. Anil Ahuja, a parent who manages his family by teaching in private coaching institutes here, questioned the rationale behind such charges. “The school has remained closed since last year. Hardly any developmental activities have taken place in the school. There is no other activity like annual function or seminar. Why is the school charging such kinds of fees?” Ahuja said. The development fees are charged towards undertaking developmental activities in the school while annual fees are charged for any educational trip or events. The Supreme Court had on May 3 delivered a judgment allowing private schools of Rajasthan to collect 85 per cent of fees for 2020-21. Last year, the Rajasthan government had directed CBSE-affiliated schools to charge 70 per cent of tuition fees only. It was upheld by Rajasthan High Court, but overruled by the apex court. The Delhi government had issued a similar order last year asking private schools to charge tuition fee, but not development or annual fees. The unaided schools challenged the order in Delhi High Court, which on May 31 allowed schools to charge the development or annual fees with a 15 per cent reduction. The court held that the arrears of last year had to be paid in six instalments. Pradhan, in his reply, said the University Grants Commission had issued a letter to the vice-chancellors of all universities and principals of colleges last year, requesting them to consider the fee issue sympathetically. However, the UGC acts as an advisory on fee-related matter. Its letter lacks enforceable power.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-416
20-07-2021||India||BJP witnesses firefighting over Nalin Kumar Kateel's audio clip ||The BJP swung into intense fire-fighting after an audio clip purportedly that of state party president Nalin Kumar Kateel claimed that chief minister B.S. Yediyurappa and two senior ministers would be dropped soon. Already hassled over mon­ths of rebellion against Yediyurappa, the audio clip has come as the latest thorn in the side of the ruling party struggling to handle disgruntled elements. “Don’t tell anyone. Eshwarappa and Shettar will be dropped (and) a new team will be in place. I have three names in my hands (but) it will be decided only from Delhi,” the voice closely resembling that of Kateel is heard saying in Tulu, a language spoken mostly in coastal Karnataka and north of Kerala. K.S. Eshwarappa is the panchayat raj minister while Jagadish Shettar is the minister for large and medium-scale industries and a former chief minister. The “three names” were apparently alternatives to Yedi­yurappa, the Lingayat strongman who has held sway in the party for over two decades. While Kateel denied he had anything to do with the audio clip that was circulated widely on social media, the party threw its weight behind him with ministers and senior leaders coming out to douse the fire. “I have nothing to do with that audio clip. I am writing to the chief minister (clarifying this),” a visibly shaken Kateel told reporters on Monday. He even denied media reports that the BJP was working on replacing Yediyurappa who had on Saturday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, triggering speculation about him offering to quit in view of the rebellion. “There is no discussion on leadership change. So this issue is irrelevant,” Kateel said alluding to the rumours that Yediyurappa would be replaced in the coming days. In a clear attempt to placate the senior leaders, Kateel said: “Yediyurappa is the soul of the party while Eshwarappa and Shettar are the two eyes…there has been no discussion in our party about changing them.” On the origin of the audio clip, Kateel said he would respond only after a probe without specifying if he was lodging a police complaint. But a senior BJP functionary told The Telegraph that the voice sounded “very much” like Kateel. “It sounds very mu­ch like Kateel. Perhaps someone standing near him (Kateel) recorded it during some conversation,” said the leader who declined to be named. He, however, echoed the party’s view that there was no plan to remove Yediyurappa. “These are all speculation since we have repeatedly said Yediyurappa will continue till the 2023 election,” he added. There has been tremendous pressure from a younger bunch of leaders on 78-year-old Yediyurappa to step down. But the party has been careful not to antagonise his influential Lingayat community by forcing him out of office. While a slew of ministers defended Kateel and insisted there was no leadership change in the offing, a terse warning came from the seer of a powerful Lingayat mutt. “Dissidence is normal. But the BJP will have to face a severe blow if the chief minister is changed,” seer of Rambhapuri Mutt, Prasanna Veerasomeshwara Shivacharya Swami, told reporters on how the community would turn its back on the party if its favourite leader is replaced. While Yediyurappa and Shettar remained silent on the audio clip, Eshwarappa could not hide his angst. “I am 72 years old. I will go by what the party says. But don’t make Kateel a sacrificial lamb,” said the minister who had in April complained to Modi, the state governor and party bosses about Yediyurappa’s interference in his department. He said it didn’t matter being a minister. “I am not in politics for this (ministership). I will do whatever my leaders and organisation ask me to,” he added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-417
20-07-2021||West Bengal||Adhikari booked for transfer threat to senior cop, call detail access claims||Amid the nationwide row over alleged snooping activities with Pegasus spyware, Leader of Opposition in the Bengal Assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, stoked a controversy when he said that he got access to call details of Purba Medinipur district SP Amarnath K, prompting the police on Tuesday to file suo motu cases against him. Adhikari, during a party meeting in the district's Tamluk area on Monday, had also publicly advised the local police chief to "refrain from doing anything that might lead to his transfer to Kashmir". Taking cognisance of his remarks, the district police, during the day, filed suo motu cases against the BJP MLA and 14 of his aides under various sections of the IPC, including one dealing with the Disaster Management Act for holding a rally without permission, and another related to deterring a public servant from performing his duty. The senior BJP leader, in his message to the district superintendent of police (SP), had said, "Do not file fake cases. I have evidence to prove that they are fake and politically motivated. I will file public interest litigation seeking a CBI probe into such allegations. "Please do not do anything that would lead to your transfer to Kashmir's Anantnag or Baramulla." The saffron party legislator is facing multiple probes, one of which involves alleged tarpaulin theft. The Nandigram MLA, who narrowly defeated Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in assembly elections held earlier this year, also said, "I have details of all calls made to you (SP and other police personnel) by the office of the nephew (TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee)," and added that "if you have the state government's support, we have the Centre by our side". Citing the example of former Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar, who the CBI had grilled for his alleged involvement in chit fund cases, Adhikari said it would be best if police officers carry out duties without bias. He hailed the NHRC report on Bengal's post-poll violence, which noted that the situation in the state is a manifestation of "law of the ruler" and not the "rule of law". The leader of opposition added that he would hold a mass agitation in the district on August 9 with one lakh people to protest against all such "malpractices". The district SP, when contacted, said, "We have lodged suo motu cases against Mr Adhikari. He claimed he has call records. Since he is not working in the law enforcement, he can't be having such devices (to record calls)." The Nandigram legislator's assertions at the party meeting have further triggered a war of words between the TMC and the BJP, with the state's ruling party demanding Adhikari's arrest for "illegally snooping into the phone of a public servant and threatening him with a transfer". "Suvendu Adhikari should be arrested immediately and interrogated in custody. He has proved that Pegasus was used to snoop on many people, including Abhishek Banerjee. It is a heinous crime. The Centre is misusing its powers," said TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh. The state BJP unit, however, came out in Adhikari's defence and said if action is taken against Adhikari, TMC leader Mukul Roy should also be arrested for making similar allegations after switching over to the BJP in 2017. "Suvendu Adhikari is a seasoned politician. He made the statements at a rally. If the police can lodge cases against Adhikari, then why is Mukul Roy being spared? "After joining the BJP, he said in an interview that the TMC government had tapped his phones. Was that statement true or false?" state BJP chief spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya maintained. Roy, who had quit the TMC in 2017 and joined the BJP, returned to the state's ruling party last month. The TMC has come down heavily on the BJP government at the Centre after party leader Abhishek Banerjee's name apparently figured in the list of targets of the Pegasus spying operation, terming it as "an attack on democracy".||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-166

Adhikari who is facing multiple police probes, including one related to alleged tarpaulin theft, asserted at a meeting held here on Monday that it would be wrong to assume that the BJP was weak as it has the central government by its side. Citing the example of former Calcutta Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar, who was grilled by the CBI for his alleged involvement in chit fund cases, Adhikari said it would be best if police officers perform their functions with integrity and to carry out their duties without prejudice, The senior BJP leader, in his message to the district Superintendent of Police Amarnath K, said, "Do not file fake cases.

20-07-2021||West Bengal||Madhyamik results declared, record 100 per cent students pass||The West Bengal Board Class 10 examination result was declared on Tuesday with a record 100 per cent pass percentage and 90 per cent of the students securing more than 60 per cent or more marks in the new evaluation method. The Madhyamik Pariksha (Class 10) examination could not be held this year due to the pandemic situation and the evaluation was based on the candidate's performance in the 2019 class examination in Class 9 and internal assessment for every subject in class 10 on a 50:50 basis. West Bengal Board of Secondary Education President Kalyanmoy Ganguly told a press meet that this 100 per cent pass of candidates is an all time record. Last year's pass percentage was 86.34 per cent. Ganguly said if a candidate is not happy with the results, he/she will be able to sit for tests once the Covid- 19 situation improves but in that situation this result won't be valid any more. Around 10 lakh students secured 60 per cent or more marks in the new evaluation method. At least 79 candidates got 697 marks out of 700 in the evaluation of this year's Madhyamik Pariksha. Asked if 79 candidates will then be considered as occupying first rank, Ganguly said "I can say this much that these students have been awarded 697 marks. And there is no merit list this year unlike in past." The number of girl students was higher than boys this year. While 6,13,849 females were slated to sit for the papers, the number of males was 4,65,850. A total of 10,79,749 candidates were slated to sit for the exam this year but due to the Covid pandemic the board had to cancel the examination as advised by experts. By typing their date of birth and registration numbers the candidates can access the scoresheet from www.wbbse.wb.gov.in, https://wbresults.nic.in, www.exametic.com and some other websites. The schools can collect marksheet from 49 camps of the board from Tuesday and from schools only parents will be given the mark sheets.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-166
20-07-2021||West Bengal||Covid-19: At 666, Bengal logs lowest daily count since March 26||Bengal on Monday reported 666 new Covid-19 infections, the lowest in a day since March 26, 115 days ago. The state logged 29 successive days of a drop in its total number of active Covid-19 cases, with 1,006 recoveries and 12 deaths. The number of active cases fell by 352 to reach 12,759. Monday was also the 15th straight day of fewer than 1,000 new infections in a day. Calcutta logged 53 new infections and no deaths. North 24-Parganas logged in 93 cases and two deaths. Monday was the 12th successive day since the second wave when not one of Bengal’s 23 districts reported a three-digit figure of new infections. Seventeen districts reported double-digit figures and North and South Dinajpur, Malda, Murshidabad, Birbhum and Purulia single-digit figures. Sixteen Bengal districts reported zero deaths and Jalpaiguri, Nadia, Howrah and Hooghly one each. Bengal’s recovery rate is at an all-time high of 97.97 per cent, with the national rate at 97.34. The state’s mortality rate is 1.19, while the nation’s is 1.32 per cent. The daily positive confirmation rate, which was nearly 33 per cent at the peak of the second wave, was 1.65 per cent on Monday, indicating the shrink in Covid-19 spread. “This is beginning to look a lot like the pre-second wave period of relative normality. Over the next few days, we hope to see fewer than 500 new cases being found in a day. The total number of active cases should fall to below 10,000 again in 10 days or less,” said a minister. The state now has a total of nearly 15.19 lakh Covid-19 cases, since the first was detected in March last year. It includes 14.88 lakh recoveries and 18,011 deaths.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-166
20-07-2021||West Bengal||Covid-19 travel restrictions: Double dose or negative test must for entry from Assam||The Bengal health department and the administrations of Alipurduar and Cooch Behar districts which share borders with Assam imposed restrictions on entry of people from the neighbouring state from Monday because of a surge in Covid-19 cases in northeastern states. “Anybody entering Bengal from Assam has to be either fully vaccinated or will have to carry an RT-PCR negative report issued not more than 72 hours ahead of his/her travel. At the border check-post, they will have to furnish the certificate of vaccination or a copy of the report to enter Bengal. The decision has been made to control the Covid-19 situation and because of the apprehension of a third wave,” said Girish Chandra Bera, the chief medical officer of health of Alipurduar. On Monday, health department staff and police were deputed at Pakhriguri in the Kumargram block of Alipurduar and at Baxirhat in the Tufanganj 2 block of Cooch Behar. Both Pakhriguri and Baxirhat share borders with Anirban Choudhury While the health staff checked those entering Bengal from Assam, the police examined their vaccination certificates and RT-PCR reports. Aminur Rehman, who was on his way from Guwahati to Siliguri with three friends, had to return because they could not produce either of the documents. “All of us have taken the first dose of the vaccine and were going to Siliguri. But we were told about the restrictions at the border and asked to come with RT-PCR negative reports. We are returning to Guwahati now,” said Aminur. But Manish Kumar and his wife could easily cross the border. They were from Guwahati and headed for Siliguri. “Both of them are fully vaccinated and carried the certificates. They were allowed to head for their destination,” said a policeman at the border. While Assam logs around 17,00 infections a day on an average, Manipur records close to 1,000 new cases everyday. Sources said any resident of Bengal, who had been to Assam and were returning home, had to follow the same guidelines. “If he cannot produce either of the documents (vaccination certificate or RT-PCR negative report), he will be sent to a quarantine centre for at least seven days,” said an official. Tufanganj 2 block development officer Prasenjit Kundu said: “We are allowing people to enter Bengal according to the guidelines. There are many local people who cross over to Assam every day for work. We are conducting rapid antigen tests on a regular basis when they are returning.” Sushanta Roy, the officer on special duty (OSD) of the state health department deputed for north Bengal, held a meeting with officials of Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts in Siliguri on Monday on the possible third wave of Covid-19. “It has been decided that in Siliguri, vaccination camps will be organised at the ward level. On each day, camps would be held in three wards of the city where 500 doses of vaccine would be available. While 400 doses would be administered to people in general, 100 doses would be kept for mothers who have children aged 12 years or less,” said Roy. He also mentioned that checkpoints would be raised at the entry points of the district so that people coming from outside could be checked. “People coming from outside should have a negative RT-PCR test report or two doses of vaccination. We also have plans to start rapid antigen tests at these points so that people tested negative can enter the districts,” the OSD added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-166
20-07-2021||West Bengal||School principal and teacher among eight arrested for child trafficking in Bankura||A 57-year-old principal and one of his female colleagues at a central government school in Bankura and six others were arrested on Sunday night for their alleged involvement in a child trafficking racket. “We have arrested the principal of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, along with seven others, including a female teacher and her husband, in the child trafficking case. We have rescued five children and sent them to a government home,” said Dhritiman Sarkar, the Bankura police chief. The police rescued three girls and two boys, aged between nine months and six years, from the custody of the principal. On Monday, a Bankura court sent principal Kamal Kumar Rajoria and two others to police custody for five days. The five others were remanded in jail custody. Bengal child and women welfare minister Sashi Panja tweeted a photograph of Rajoria along with BJP MP and minister of state of education Subhas Sarkar at a BJP programme. Sarkar, however, pleaded ignorance. “It was a programme of distribution of educational stationery to students and the principal was just invited,” Sarkar said. Police sources said, a group of villagers, including a few local Trinamul leaders, on Sunday spotted the principal and seven others trying to pack three children, who were crying, into a car. The police have learnt that Rajoria had joined the JKV in 2017 as a principal and was living alone in his quarter on the school premises. Initially, the principal tried to argue that the children had come for admission to the school, but the villagers weren’t satisfied as admission to the school starts from class VI and informed police. He told the police that his wife also knew about the children as he kept them with him on humanitarian grounds. “But we contacted the wife of Rajoria in Rajasthan who said she had no knowledge about such children living with her husband,” said a police officer. Police sources said Rajoria, who is a resident of Rajasthan’s Dausa, first purchased a nine-month-old baby from a red-light area of Durgapur’s Kada Road and handed it over to Sushma Sharma, an assistant teacher of the school, who had no child. Sharma and her banker husband are among the arrested eight persons. “Later, he brought two baby girls, aged around four and six years, and kept them at his quarter for the past few months. On Sunday evening, a woman, along with her mother and four others, came with two more children and handed them over to the principal. The principal was trying to send the new children to other places,” said a police officer. The police said they would interrogate Rajoria to know why he would keep the children illegally and what the purpose was. “We suspect the children could be trafficked to other states and there may be many people involved in the racket,” said a police officer. Trinamul leaders in Bankura said Rajoria was very actively associated with the BJP and took part in the campaign for the Assembly elections this year. “The photograph along with Subhas Sarkar proves his connection with the BJP,” said a Trinamul leader. Ananya Chakraborty, the chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said she had sought a report from the Bankura district magistrate.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-166
20-07-2021||West Bengal||Had not permitted BJP MP and minister John Barla to use leased land: Tea company||The company that owns the Lakhipara tea estate near Banarhat of Jalpaiguri district had not issued permission to Alipurduar MP and Union minister John Barla to build a house on the leased land of the garden, representatives of the Indian Tea Association said here on Monday. The BJP MP and minister, who hails from Lakhipara, built a house on a plot of the tea garden, which was completed after he became a parliamentarian in 2019. Barla, who was  an employee of this tea garden till 2018, had earlier got quarters by the garden management on the land, sources said. On Monday, Sanjoy Bagchi, secretary of the Dooars branch of Indian Tea Association, along with the garden’s manager and representatives of the tea company, met Jalpaiguri district magistrate Moumita Godara Basu. Lakhipara is a member-garden of the ITA, the largest association of tea planters in the country. “We submitted in writing that the (Lakhipara) garden authorities had not granted permission to the MP to build a house. The garden can’t issue such a permission as it has taken the land on lease from the state. The land can be used only for infrastructure needed to run a tea estate,” said Bagchi. Recently, Trinamul alleged that the Alipurduar MP, who had raised a cry for separate statehood or Union territory status for north Bengal, had built personal property on government land in Jalpaiguri. Taking note, the DM asked for a report. According to the report, Barla, recently elevated as  junior minister for minority affairs, had built a house in Lakhipara and was constructing a commercial complex at Chamurchi More in Banarhat on a plot owned by the state PWD. This prompted the DM to write to the PWD and tea garden how they allowed private construction. Responding to the letter, a team of planters’ association and tea company met the DM on Monday and handed her a written reply. Members of the tea delegation, however, dodged a direct reply when asked if the tea company had overlooked Barla’s construction of the house on the garden land. A senior manager in another tea estate of the Dooars, when asked to comment, said any interruption of the construction work might have led to “problems in the garden”. “Speaking from the point of view of the tea garden management, any abrupt move can leave his followers disgruntled and lead to protests,” he said. The DM confirmed that the tea company in writing said it had not given permission to the MP. “We are awaiting the reply of the state PWD. We will then send details to the state government,” she said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-166
20-07-2021||West Bengal||Youth commits suicide after forced marriage with minor girl||A youth allegedly hanged himself at his house a few hours after he was forced to marry a minor girl by a “salishi sabha” at Mankutbandh village in Malda district on Sunday. Sources said Manik Mandal, 20, had an affair with a minor girl of the same village. He was forced to marry the girl at a local temple. On Sunday, some local people spotted the duo in a mango plantation and intercepted them. Shortly, a salishi sabha was convened. Tushar, Manik’s brother, said: “At the meeting, a section of villagers advocated that they immediately get married. We pointed out that the girl is minor. Also, my father was away from home for some work and we pleaded that they wait. But none of them listened to us.” Later, a section of people at the meeting arranged the couple’s marriage at a local temple. “My son was mentally depressed because of the decision imposed on him. We also felt humiliated by the manner in which he was forced to marry the girl,” Shyamali, the boy’s mother said. The youth didn’t reach the legal age of 21 for marriage either. The sources said Ashish Mondal, a member of Manikchak panchayat from the village, was present at the meeting. “It is disappointing that Mondal did not try to dissuade others from arranging the marriage as the girl is a minor. If he could not handle the situation, he should have informed us or the child-line,” said an official of the Manikchak block administration. Mondal, however, denied the charges. Alok Rajoria, Malda police chief, said a case had been registered after the youth’s death. “Our officers are investigating the case,” he said. The incident has brought to light the practice of convening salishi sabha in rural areas.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-166
20-07-2021||West Bengal||Abhishek and Prashant on leaked list of Pegasus targets||Abhishek Banerjee and Prashant Kishor, the two most influential figures associated with the Trinamul Congress during the recent Bengal elections after Mamata Banerjee, were among the potential or intended targets of the Pegasus spying operation, a media collective reported on Monday. According to The Wire, the Indian news portal that was part of the global collective, Kishor’s phone was broken into using the spyware during the Bengal Assembly elections and the numbers of Abhishek and his personal secretary were among the potential targets. The Guardian, the UK newspaper that was part of the media alliance, reported that an examination by Amnesty’s Security Lab “found evidence of intrusion by Pegasus in April — in the midst of the election campaign — indicating Kishor’s phone calls, emails and messages were being monitored throughout the final weeks of the bitter contest”. The timing of the purported hacking of Kishor’s phone — in the middle of the Bengal Assembly elections — raises disturbing questions, especially whether the foulest form of electoral malpractice was committed by those who wanted to dislodge Mamata from power. The Bengal election battlefield is no stranger to allegations of foul play but never before has the possibility of such sophisticated snooping entered the picture. “Those who did (the hacking) were looking to take undue advantage of their position of power with the help of illegal snooping,” Kishor told The Guardian. Kishor had also worked closely with the DMK in Tamil Nadu — another handsome victor this summer — and is on board with the Congress for the Punjab Assembly elections with speculation rife on a larger, pan-India role for him in the Opposition space. According to The Wire, Amnesty’s forensic analysis found traces of infection on Kishor’s phone on April 28, just a day before the last of the eight phases of polling in Bengal. It added that traces of Pegasus on Kishor’s phone were also detected on 14 days in June 2021 and 12 days in July 2021, including July 13, the day he met Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Delhi. On Monday evening, Abhishek, Trinamul national general secretary, MP and Mamata’s nephew, tweeted: “Two Minutes of SILENCE for the SORE LOSERS!” He added: “Despite ALLIES like ED, CBI, NIA, IT, ECI, @BJP4India’s money + might and #PegasusSpying, Mr @AmitShah couldn’t save his face in #BengalElections2021. Please COME Prepared with Better RESOURCES in 2024!” Several senior Trinamul leaders said they expected Mamata to focus on the issue on Wednesday, July 21, when the party commemorates Martyrs’ Day. “Expect fireworks from her on Wednesday,” said a party vice-president. Mamata is scheduled to address the biggest annual event on the Trinamul calendar virtually – because of the pandemic -- from 2pm. This time, the party has made arrangements for the event to be shown live at various locations across India, including Gujarat and Delhi. “She realises the firepower of this issue, and she will utilise it optimally,” he said, quickly adding a reminder about Mamata’s repeated allegations in the past couple of years that her phone had been hacked by the BJP and the agencies at its disposal. “If the use of such methods during the Bengal elections is taken as a test case, then it is quite clear that such things hardly have any impact on the electoral outcome,” Kishor told The Wire. Kishor, who helped Trinamul script a remarkable turnaround within two years of the Lok Sabha poll setback, added: “Having said so, there is no denying that those who did so were looking to take undue advantage of their position of power with the help of illegal snooping.” Kishor’s I-Pac has been retained by Trinamul for not only the general election of 2024 but also the Assembly polls of 2026 in Bengal.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-167
20-07-2021||West Bengal||Seven persons arrested with deadly kite strings in Nadia ||Seven persons flying kites were arrested from Nadia’s Santipur on Monday for endangering public life, the action coming in the backdrop of a spate of accidents in the town over the past one month related to the use of nylon and other banned strings by kite fliers. On Monday afternoon, a Class XII girl suffered a deep cut in the throat from a nylon-made kite string while she was cycling back home after her tuition. Last week, the police arrested two persons for selling and stocking nylon strings after many cases of injuries were reported, including one in which a four-year-old suffered a severe gash on his throat and had to be given six stitches. The recent incidents coupled with an increasing demand among residents for action against kite fliers using life-threatening strings prompted the police on Monday to raid several pockets in the town. “We have tried our best to sensitise people and also urged them to refrain from flying kites using life-threatening nylon and metal strings. But, a section of people have preferred not to listen and hence we were forced to take action,” a senior police officer of Ranaghat police district said. The senior cop added: “The use of life-threatening nylon kite strings compelled us to act against kite fliers. Nylon and metallic strings are stronger and  more dangerous than regular cotton strings as the former do not snap easily. Falling kite strings become lethal when they catch unsuspecting cyclists and motorcyclists by the throat and lead to severe injuries.” On Monday, police personnel, along with civic volunteers, raided several houses and arrested seven kite fliers, all in their 30s, from rooftops of their homes. Several others were detained  for interrogation. The police also confiscated a large number of spools and prohibited kite strings. Police sources said the arrested persons will be produced before the additional chief judicial magistrate’s court on Tuesday. Separate police teams during the raids also seized several rolls of prohibited nylon strings, kites and spools from those flying kites. Welcoming the police action, social activist Anupam Saha said: “The government should  ban the sale and stocking of all types of dangerous strings used for kite flying.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-167
20-07-2021||West Bengal||Border Security Force personnel arrests biker with 3.5 kilos of gold biscuits in North 24-Parganas||Border Security Force (BSF) personnel seized 30 gold biscuits, weighing 3.5 kilos and worth around Rs 1.72 crore, from a truck driver when he was leaving the Petrapole international cargo port in North 24-Parganas on a motorcycle on Monday. The accused, identified as Suman Tarafdar, 29, is resident of Jayantipur of Petrapole. Also arrested with him was his alleged associate Aashiq Haldar, 23, who was riding pillion. Aashiq hails from village Kalyani. Both the youths were handed over to the customs department along with the seized gold. The duo were then taken into police custody. Suman is associated with a Calcutta-based transporter and drives trucks to Bangladesh, the police said. A BSF spokesperson of South Bengal Frontier said Suman had gone to Benapole in Bangladesh with export items on July 15. On Monday, he returned without the truck apparently owing to illness. “When he was leaving on his motorcycle that had been parked at the ICP Petrapole parking lot, our team became suspicious. He was stopped near the railway crossing and frisked. Our personnel found the gold biscuits strapped around his waistline,” the spokesperson said. During questioning, Suman confessed to have received the gold biscuits from one “Karim bhai” in Benapole to hand them over to members of an alleged smuggling racket on the Indian side of the border, BSF sources said. “He said he had been offered Rs 1,000 for the job,” the BSF spokesperson added. Arun Kumar, commanding officer of 179 battalion, got in touch with customs officials at ICP Petrapole with an appeal to prevent smuggling by persons involved in import and export as well as cross-border movement of vehicles.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-167
20-07-2021||West Bengal||Firing incident: TMC leaders of Cooch Behar visit ancestral house of Partha Pratim Roy||A number of Trinamul leaders of Cooch Behar district, including former state minister Rabindranath Ghosh, visited the ancestral house of Partha Pratim Roy, the party’s district president, at Jiranpur on the outskirts of Cooch Behar town on Monday, a day after some men had entered the premises of the house and fired bullets in the air. Ghosh, who is known for his differences with party colleague Roy, reached the latter’s house with some associates, spoke to the family members and residents nearby, and assured them of all help from his side. “These past few days, there have been multiple incidents of violence in Jiranpur. Earlier, the panchayat office was ransacked and on Sunday, some people entered the district president’s house and fired in the air. We want the police to take stern steps and arrest all those involved in the attack,” said Ghosh. The former minister, however, had to face criticism from a section of party leaders who are known to be close to Roy. They claimed that after the firing incident on Sunday, Ghosh had remarked that it was an “orchestrated attack.” “What he (Ghosh) said led to confusion among party workers. He should refrain from such remarks,” said Rahul Roy, a district secretary of Trinamul. Cooch Behar Trinamul is also known for acute infighting, something which has cost the party dearly during both the 2019 Lok Sabha and 2021 Assembly polls. Police probing the firing said it was unlikely that the attack was organised by a terror outfit like the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO). Recently, the KLO had issued a statement that contained a direct message for Roy and another Trinamul leader about taking the issue of separate statehood seriously or facing consequences. “We are working on some inputs and hope to nab those who had fired the bullets (inside the premises of the campus of Roy’s house). It seems some locals were involved in the case and our officers are trying to know the motive. Security has been beefed up in the area,” said a police source.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-167
20-07-2021||Opinion||Editorial: Chosen few||Can the bahujan — ‘majority’ — coexist peacefully with the sarvajan — ‘everyone’? This has been one of the most enduring dilemmas confronting the Bahujan Samaj Party. The BSP has, undoubtedly, been one of the principal champions of political representation and empowerment of Dalits, which, as per the census of 2011, comprised a little over 20 per cent of Uttar Pradesh’s population. Yet — this point cannot be underemphasized — the BSP’s high noon in 2007, when it went on to win power in UP on its own, was made possible by its eagerness to forge a broader, rainbow alliance with Brahmins and Dalits willing to join hands in an unprecedented show of solidarity. Mayawati, the BSP’s undisputed leader, seems to be of the opinion that the time is now ripe for a similar experiment in reverse social engineering. She recently declared that the party would launch a campaign under the stewardship of Satish Mishra to attract Brahmins back to the BSP’s fold. Political calculations, obviously, lie at the heart of this outreach. Ms Mayawati’s belief is that the present chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, and the Bharatiya Janata Party have ended up alienating Brahmins on account of their patronage of Kshatriyas — Mr Adityanath belongs to this caste group. A sarvajan alliance, instead of mobilizing Dalits alone, could, Ms Mayawati hopes, brighten the chances of an electoral resurgence. Yet, this strategy is not without its own pitfalls. One of the reasons behind the BSP’s political eclipse since 2012 has been the competitive aspirations of Brahmins and Dalits. Achieving an enduring balance between the historically conflicting interests of these two social groupings could pose a steep challenge even for a seasoned politician. Ms Mayawati’s hold on her core support group may need to be re-examined too. Dalit perceptions of the BJP seem to have undergone a subtle transformation — for the better — especially among non-Jatavs, fracturing the BSP’s arc of influence even among its traditional voters. It remains to be seen whether Ms Mayawati retains the ability to regain the ground that she had ceded to the BJP, given that the word on the street is that she no longer can afford to be adversarial to the ruling regime in Delhi. Political considerations apart, Ms Mayawati’s appeal conveys a deeper tragedy about Indian democracy. Even after seven decades of Independence, the fulcrum of politics continues to revolve on the appeasement of ascriptive social formations.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-64
20-07-2021||Opinion||Letters to the editor: Olympics Covid threat, Kanwar Yatra finally cancelled ||No surprise Sir — At least three athletes and around 50 other people associated with the Olympics have tested positive for Covid-19 days before the Games are scheduled to take place. With tens of thousands of participants from over 200 countries gathering in Tokyo, this was inevitable. If the infection, especially the Delta variant, spreads among the general public — Japan has a low vaccination rate — the country will witness a devastating Covid wave. Aparajita Saha,Calcutta About time Sir — It was a relief to read that the Kanwar Yatra has been called off by the Uttar Pradesh government in view of Covid-19 a day after the Supreme Court directed the state to cancel the event. Earlier, the state government had argued that only those who were fully vaccinated or could produce a negative RT-PCR test report would be allowed to undertake the journey. But in reality, it would have been impossible to monitor the health status of all devotees. It would have been a disaster to hold a physical Kanwar Yatra when the third wave of the coronavirus is knocking at our doors. The UP government has now announced that it will go ahead with a pared-down, symbolic version of the Kanwar Yatra. This may bring a sense of comfort to the thousands of devotees who would have otherwise made the journey on foot. The apex court was right to point out that religious sentiments are subservient to the fundamental right to life and health. It was absolutely necessary for the Supreme Court to step in and make the UP government cancel the event. Had the Kanwar Yatra taken place this year, the country would have, once again, witnessed the devastating scenes that marked the second wave of the pandemic. Bhagwan Thadani,Mumbai Sir — It is mind-boggling how the Uttar Pradesh government could have insisted on holding the Kanwar Yatra this year. It was not long ago that scenes of bodies floating in the Ganga or mass cremations along the river’s banks during the second wave of the pandemic flashed on our TV screens. While it is good news that the yatra has finally been cancelled, the Supreme Court should not have had to intervene in the first place. Amar K.

20-07-2021||Opinion|| Editorial: Minor matter||Flaunting the power of the majority is not a mark of civilization. At a hearing of two petitions against the state government’s ban on slaughterhouses in Hardwar district, the Uttarakhand High Court reportedly said that democracy meant the protection of minorities. This perception has keen relevance at a time when numbers alone seem to form the basis of power. The aspiration to equality, certain rights identified as fundamental in the Constitution and the freedoms that define a democracy are felt to be fading away. But according to the high court, democracy was not only rule by the majority — a principle that is far from the philosophy of the ruling regime. Not only did the high court bring up the protection of minorities in this context but it also made the treatment of minorities the sole yardstick by which to judge the greatness of a civilization. In the era of attempts by Narendra Modi’s government to establish India’s Vishwaguru status, such a notion should cause discomfort and self-reflection. But such a response is unlikely. That the subject of a ban on slaughterhouses should bring up the issue of minority protection indicates how obvious discrimination has become. The question raised by the high court in this context has implications for all citizens, not just one segment among them. Can the State decide a citizen’s diet? In 2015, refusing to uphold Maharashtra’s temporary ban on the sale of meat for a religious festival, the Supreme Court had reportedly said that a ban could not be forced down anyone’s throat. Any prohibition should take into account the spirit of tolerance and the sensibilities of the people. It is only possible for a Bharatiya Janata Party government to sabotage the intention of the latter principle by turning it inside out. Thus Assam now has a bill in the assembly that proposes to ban the slaughter of cattle and the sale of beef in areas where Hindus, Jains and Sikhs are a majority or within a five-kilometre radius of a temple or satra. The area-specific aspect of the bill, more than statewide bans or restrictions on cattle slaughter elsewhere, emphasizes discrimination on religious grounds. It is such casual frankness about discriminatory policy that makes the Uttarakhand High Court’s remark about the treatment of minorities so necessary.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-64
20-07-2021||Opinion||Seeds of trouble||A quiet, reverse transformation is happening in the countryside, and it is disconcerting. This sowing season, growing numbers of farmers are falling back on their bullocks as fuel prices are piercing the roof. The tractor, the symbol of modern farming, is becoming a luxury in the literal sense. The conventional ploughing equipment tied to bullocks costs only a trifle compared to the rates of tractors. This is happening in relatively better off states where tractors had largely replaced bullocks over the last two or three decades. But in places where, and for those people for whom, draught power is not an option, rising fuel prices have increased production costs on tractor-hiring. The demand for bullocks has thus gone up. Those who eke out a living using a tractor — for sowing, mulching and harvesting — are struggling as small peasants can no longer afford to hire tractors for farm operations. On an average, across India, the cost of hiring a tractor has gone up by 20-30 per cent — roughly Rs 300 an hour from Rs 700 to Rs 1,000 an hour. For an acre, for instance, paddy farmers in central India are paying Rs 3,000 more than they did last year for sowing operations. It is the same for wheat, cotton or soybean. This has serious consequences for actual farm incomes. They would drop significantly. In one paddy-dominated village in rural Nagpur, this writer found a new barter system evolving this year. Tractor owners are saying: “Pay fuel costs now to hire the machine. Pay the driver’s wages in the form of rice at the time of harvest. But don’t make us keep our tractors parked. Give us work.” Fallow land That is just one problem. Rural India, battered badly by the second wave of Covid-19 in the summer, is mired in other mounting worries too, apart from the looming spectre of a third wave. Take crop credit outlay: it is yet to pick up in most states this season. A sluggish credit disbursal affects sowing operations. Informal credit is hard to come by, as farm-input dealers — people who sell their inputs to farmers on credit — and other private lenders are not offering credit lines to the peasantry. The reason: the possibility of a third wave and a liquidity crunch. No one wants to take the risk. Last year, the agriculture sector supported the migrants who went back home in the middle of the first, hurriedly implemented lockdown. This year, though, a combination of factors is hurting them immensely. Take another way in which they are suffering. There seems to be a drop in land-leasing. How much? We shall know later this year. Millions of marginal and small farmers who, apart from tilling their small plots also cultivate the farm land on lease, are either reluctant or have no liquidity to lease land this year. Indications, therefore, are that India might see a sharp drop in the cultivated land area this year as the otherwise leased-lands may stay fallow. More problems Then, there are problems with regard to payments for the crops sold last year. Deferred and delayed payments meant that small and mostly sustenance farmers had no money in hand, and the second wave of the coronavirus crippled the markets and normal life ahead of the kharif sowings. Another problem: Maharashtra, indeed much of India, is seeing a decline in crop insurance figures. The deadline to buy the fasal bima (crop insurance) for the ongoing kharif season has passed, but farmers are not opting for it because, one, doing so has not helped in the past and, two, nationalized and cooperative banks are slow in disbursing crop loans, with which the crop insurance comes compulsorily tagged in many states. That the online process remains cumbersome has not helped either, in spite of tall claims to the contrary.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-64
20-07-2021||Opinion||The dawn of Quantum computing||Investments in quantum technologies are growing because of their tremendous potential to revolutionize humankind, both in terms of aiding science and the business at large. With the world increasingly being challenged by ever more complex problems to solve, quantum computing is likely to give us solutions that classical computing cannot. For example, we are currently trying to ascertain ways to deactivate the functioning of the coronavirus, which is less than 100 nanometres in size, by exploring computer-generated models of the spike-proteins of the virus. Another example of a complex issue is the exponential increase in the energy consumption rate with human population inflation. Both problems have an exponential number of variables, which cannot be solved by classical computers or even supercomputers within a practical amount of time. Situations like the above show that problems that are exponential in nature demand exponential computational power. Here’s where quantum computers can be of help. A quantum computer imbibes nonlinear properties of nature and uses quantum mechanics as its foundation. It aims to solve extremely complex problems. Quantum computers are not just faster versions of classical computers; they represent a fundamentally different computing paradigm. Classical computers work with bits, the basic elements of information that store either a ‘zero’ or a ‘one’ as value. Quantum computers work with interdependent and nonlinear structures called qubit (quantum bit), which is the unit of quantum information. From a usage standpoint, we can see quantum computing accelerating some of the most challenging problems in chemistry, optimization, and machine learning. In machine learning, quantum computing can be applied to train and run machine-learning algorithms that can allow us to solve complex problems quickly, improving applications like disease diagnosis, fraud detection, and efficient energy management. In the field of chemistry, material sciences and high-energy physics, the application of quantum computing is more on the simulation of the quantum mechanical system. Scientists at Mitsubishi Chemical are using quantum computers to better understand chemical reactions to help develop more efficient batteries. Optimization also opens up a vast variety of use cases like portfolio optimization, financial risk analysis and route optimization in supply chain areas. From a time when quantum computing was mostly pursued by academics and theorists, it has reached a point where enterprises are beginning to explore its uses across industries. According to a survey by Gartner, 44 per cent of enterprises expect quantum technology to have a substantial impact on businesses in the next 3-5 years. Around the world, we are seeing a rise in investments in quantum research and development. Governments and industries see the vast potential of this technology in disrupting established business models and redefining entire industries. What that means is that several enterprises are now looking to hire developers who can programme and run quantum algorithms using the company’s data on real quantum hardware. Developers who demonstrate fundamental knowledge of quantum computing concepts and can use the various quantum software development kits like Qiskit are now in demand. Today, there are multiple offerings from industries that provide a path for developers with various backgrounds to earn a certification in programming, allowing them to leverage their quantum coding skills to address various use cases for the industry. A survey from Burning Glass Technologies notes that the skill areas projected to grow the fastest include Quantum Computing and Connected Technologies, with forecasted growth rates of 135 per cent and 104 per cent, respectively. We can expect that enterprises will look to hire those who have the necessary knowledge and skill sets in this new field. The work to build future-ready quantum skills is already underway. In 2020 and 2021, several universities like the Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta, the University of Calcutta, the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, IIT Kharagpur and the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore started courses for students to accelerate advanced training and research in quantum computing. For those who want to understand the basics of quantum computing, the free online course, ‘Introduction to Quantum Computing and Quantum Hardware’ by Qiskit includes labs and hands-on sessions. There are also other free and paid online courses available today on several online learning platforms. It is very easy for someone with basic understanding of linear algebra and Python skills to get started on quantum computing, now accessible via Cloud, and write algorithms in Python and run them on an actual quantum computer. There is a need to have a strong industry-academia-government collaboration to build an ecosystem that can further quantum adoption in India. For example, IBM has collaborated with India’s leading universities to accelerate advanced training and research in quantum computing. This collaboration will allow access to IBM quantum systems, quantum learning resources and quantum tools over IBM Cloud for education purposes. This will also allow one to work on actual quantum computers and programme them using the Qiskit open-source framework. Quantum computing is on the verge of bringing about a paradigm shift. Even though universal quantum computing has not yet reached mainstream commercialization, we believe that specific applications such as chemical modelling, scenario simulation, optimization, and artificial intelligence/ machine learning could be a significant competitive advantage. Advances like these could also open the door to new scientific discoveries, life-saving drugs, and improvements in supply chains, logistics and the modelling of financial data.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-64
20-07-2021||Opinion||Thirty years on||This month marks the 30th anniversary of the 1991 reforms in India. There is intense commemoration of what is considered to have been a paradigm shift in Indian economic policies. Thirty years are rarely a marker for any honour, though; silver, golden, platinum and centenary anniversaries are the usual choice. So what is the reason for the popular recall of  the 1991 reforms at the 30-year mark? The main cause for this is growth pessimism. Gloom and doubts have arisen that nothing, neither reforms nor policies, is working. There is bewilderment about what exactly the growth strategy or framework is; there is a lack of clarity about the prolonged slowdown and investment stagnation. Alarm is increasing over protective tariffs, selective targeting of industries/products and other such policies hinting at a reversal of the liberalization course adopted in 1991. Hence, there is a yearning for something dramatic to change the status quo and break the economic stalemate, as had happened in 1991. Then, exchange rate devaluation and industrial delicensing changed aggregate relative prices and investment incentives to trigger resource shifts. Most other reforms happened in subsequent years, through engagement with stakeholders and institutions, consensus and adaptation to Indian conditions. In fact, the memory of 1991 was revived much earlier — at least two years ago — as some members of industry urged the government to recreate the ‘1991 moment’. The memory sharpened with Covid-19, with many advocating the conversion of the crisis into an opportunity, as was done in 1991, following a balance of payments crisis. The growth pessimism is now omnipresent, but an incipient creep appeared some years ago. In hindsight, this perhaps began when the bonanza of the collapse of oil prices tapered off and lifted the covers off India’s growth drivers: the deficiency in private investment demand persisted; replacing its shortfall with public capital expenditures, which was supported by godsends — fuel tax revenues — was becoming a fiscal struggle; it became evident that consumer demand could not pull the gross domestic product ahead for longer. Demonetization in 2016-17 dealt a negative blow to aggregate output and employment. The demand for some of the factor and product market reforms, which were pending owing to the lack of political will and consensus in previous coalition governments, then gained force. The need for these reforms was universally agreed upon after the 2012 economic slowdown; it was felt that structural changes could potentially alter India’s growth trajectory in the difficult world environment after the 2008 crisis. In fact, this constituted the backdrop for electing a majority government in 2014 to clear the path for revisiting the unaddressed reforms. The present government, then in its first tenure, responded by introducing the goods and services tax in July 2017; it followed inflation-targeting, a fundamental change to the monetary policy framework in 2015. In 2016 came the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, a resolution mechanism for the large pile-up of bad loans holding back the banking and corporate sectors. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, and the recapitalization, consolidation and merger of public banks were announced. Foreign direct investment was continuously liberalized, leaving no sector impermissible except for security purposes. Yet, GDP growth fell in succession for the next two years in 2018 and 2019, by 6.8 per cent and 6.5 per cent. Voices in favour of reforms like those in 1991 first appeared at the time from the private sector. By mid-2019, in surprising coincidence with a resounding re-election of the government in power, growth pessimism had only increased. The feeling of a growth crisis, that India had lost its momentum or its mojo, was obvious and manifest in appeals for a spectacular shift in course. Reforms were not yielding the expected dividend, public investment was failing to attract business spending; so, what could be the source of growth? The government reacted swiftly by axing corporate taxes in September 2019 to induce private investment, among numerous other measures in a series of weekly announcements during that period. But in adverse parallel to 2012, GDP growth slipped below 5 per cent in a series of shocking slides — to 4.6 per cent in July-September 2019, 3.3 per cent in October-December 2019 and 3 per cent in the March 2020 quarter. When the severity of the national lockdown broke the economy’s back last year, the mass growth pessimism morphed into calls for converting the fresh crisis into an opportunity. The crisis backdrop of the 1991 reforms has long engendered belief that India does not reform itself otherwise; therefore, reforms can be expected in a growth crisis of similar magnitude, as was thought in 2012. The government did bite some difficult bullets. It brought in sweeping changes to labour and farm laws, as well as a production-linked incentive scheme to stimulate manufacturing output and employment, to name some of the steps in the Atmanirbhar series. The second change is still a work-in-progress, while the backlash against the planned changes to agriculture markets and institutions is still playing out, so it is difficult to predict future gains. The point is that none of the above reforms have prevented a resurgence of the 1991 nostalgia. People are looking back. There is a lot of introspection about the design, sequencing and timing of reforms. There is lengthy deliberation over what needs to be done further; it is pointed out that the next spheres of fundamental change are health, education, the judiciary, the police and so on; the need for Centre-state cooperation and resources required is underlined, among other factors. However, there is a certain disconnect between this discourse and the present context. The elephant in the room is that reforms have stopped working in India. Macroeconomic stimulation, too, has been failing to inspire growth and investments in a deeply underinvested country. Can more reforms uplift growth pessimism when the root of its deepening pervasion is that neither reforms nor helpful policies are succeeding in revival? This awareness was brewing for some years; it has become all-encompassing now. After a long time — let us say since 1991 — the feeling that India can grow at, or get back to, the 8 per cent path has all but evaporated. What lies ahead? Some economists argue that growth does not immediately follow after reforms but with a lag; that the high growth witnessed after 2003 was owing to the previous decade’s reforms. This may well be true. By now, though, it is known that India’s potential growth — the growth rate that can be sustained in the medium-term without creating excess inflation — has fallen because of the decade-long investment deficit. Post-pandemic, this has likely lowered further because of the permanent damages, to around 5 per cent or even less. In that case, incremental gains from structural reforms will not yield corresponding high growth rates of the go-go years of 2004-2010. It seems that growth pessimism or the sense of having lost momentum may persist for a long time. Remembering 1991 is unlikely to change that.

However, most of the government-run session sites remained non-operational across Jharkhand, including capital Ranchi, where about 500 doses were administered by private hospitals alone until 4.30pm, as per Co-Win portal. “We received 2,13,340 Covishield doses today (Tuesday) and we are expecting over 31,000 Covaxin doses tomorrow (Wednesday). The 2.13 lakh Covishield doses were scheduled for delivery on July 21, but we got it a day prior to the scheduled date to overcome the current crisis,” Jharkhand’s immunisation officer, Dr. Ajit Prasad said. The fresh lot of vaccines would be distributed among  districts by the end of Tuesday, and the vaccination drive is likely to regain some pace from Wednesday onwards, said Dr. Prasad, adding that Jharkhand was expecting at least 10 lakh more doses of vaccines this month. Jharkhand residents, however, had a tough time booking slots at session sites and get jabs on Tuesday, the second day in a row owing to the vaccine crisis. As per data available on the Co-Win portal, only 263 of the 3377 government-run session sites opened their doors for beneficiaries, while as many as 16 private hospitals offered vaccinations. No government-run session sites were operational in Ranchi for the second day in a row. As per Co-Win portal, only three private vaccination centres and military hospital had slots available in Ranchi. While the vaccination at Medica Diagnostics Centre, Medica Hospital and Paras Hospital were paid, vaccination at Military Hospital was only open for army personnel. The situation was worse in East Singhbhum, where only one private vaccination centre, Red Cross Hospital, was open on Tuesday for paid jabs. In Dhanbad too, only Asarfi Hospital was open for paid vaccination on the day, while no session sites were operational in Bokaro and Chatra. Four government-run session sites were, however, open in Deoghar district. As per data shared by National Health Mission (NHM), the state had as many as 45,370 doses of vaccines before the vaccination process began on Tuesday. Jharkhand, as per NHM data, has received over 82 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin from the Centre so far.

20-07-2021||Jharkhand||Singh Mansion feud spills over to trade union legitimacy||The ongoing war of attrition between the descendants of the Singh mansion has shifted from the political front to trade unionism. Siddharth Singh alias Manish Singh, youngest son of former MLA of Jharia, Late Suryadeo Singh today staked claim in the property claiming to be the genuine representative of trade union Janta Mazdoor Sangh, established by his father. He also ruled off his uncle Bachcha Singh’s claim over Janta Mazdoor Sangh, clubbing it as a false claim. He even cited the recent grant of registration to Janta Mazoor Sangh, headquartered at Bihar Building Jharia given by the registrar, Labour Union of Jharkhand Government, Ranchi as a proof for his claim as the genuine representative of Janta Mazoor Sangh, which is affiliated on Central Trade Union, Hind Mazdoor Sabha. Notably, at present two different factions of Janta Mazdoor Sangh are operating in every colliery of Dhanbad. One faction - Janta Mazoor Sangh (Kunti faction) led by his mother Kunti Singh and another called Janta Mazoor Sangh (Bachcha Singh faction) led by his uncle. To validate his point, he elaborated on the history. He mentioned about the Bihar government in 2017 having cancelled the registration of 980 labour unions of Jharkhand registered in Bihar. Sustained talks between the labour unions and Jharkhand government, eventually led to these labour unions being allowed an opportunity to apply for fresh registration as trade union with the Jharkhand Government. “While we had applied for the registration within the allotted time for (October 2019), Bachcha Singh didn’t even apply and has instead challenged our application,” Said Singh. “Following the protracted two-year long fight over the objection of Bachcha Singh, our union has finally been provided registration on July 16, 2021, proving the Bachcha Singh led Union is fake,” claimed Singh. Showing the certificate of registration provided by the registrar labour union, Singh claimed the registration of his faction will end the debate of which union is genuine. “Now we will not allow any other person to use our trade union letter pads or documents by putting a bracket of any faction and take legal recourse against any misuse of the name of our trade union,” said Singh. Being the joint-secretary of Janta Mazdoor Sangh (Kunti faction) he added that there is only one Union, which is led by his mother. Notably, war of supremacy between the family members began 15 years after the death of Suryadeo Singh (1991). Bachcha Singh who joined politics in 1991 and lost two consecutive elections in 1991 and 1995 from Jharia Assembly and finally won in 2000 to become first Urban Development Minister. Relationship between Bachcha Singh and Kunti Singh, wife of Late Suryadeo Singh soured when Kunti won from Jharia in 2005 on a BJP ticket against the wishes of her brother in law.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-98
20-07-2021||Jharkhand||Mission Kartavya to tackle ‘third wave’ in Jharkhand||The state health department has initiated efforts to reactivate and strengthen a well-coordinated platform between government and civil society organisations/NGOs across all the 24 districts as part of its move to step up ground works for the effective management of Covid-19 pandemic ahead of the anticipated ‘Third Wave’. Health department has named the initiative as Mission Kartavya under which every district is mandated to set up Go-CSO (government-civil society organisation) coordination committees on priority basis. The deputy commissioner has been directed to review the progress regularly and also address the shortcomings through different interventions by striking coordination with the state level committee (health department). The health department is to be updated daily about GO-CSO’s progress. A letter in this regard has been dispatched to all the districts of the state by the additional chief secretary of health department, Arun Kumar Singh. Details concerning the standard operating procedures under the mission have been mentioned in the letter. “Covid second wave posed new challenges for us and therefore strategies are being made to prevent and respond to the emerging situation of a possible third wave. A more coordinated effort of CSOs (civil society organisations) and government is the need of the hour for which key directions have been issued to every district,” he said. In Jharkhand, a mechanism for GO- CSO coordination was put in place, on the direction of Niti Aayog during the first wave of Covid-19 but later it was discontinued due to various reasons as a result of which government’s handling of the pandemic turned chaotic during the initial phase of the second wave, which led to the piling of cases, which eventually led to heavy mortalities. Health department is now putting its act in place, way in advance to address the unforeseeable threat judiciously. “Mission Kartavya is an initiative to reactivate and strengthen GO-CSO coordination platforms in the state to concert the efforts of government and CSOs with a set of planned interventions to meet the demands arising from changing scenarios in the light of the impending third wave,” he said. Under this mission, the state nodal agency of UNICEF will work closely with district nodal officers and mother CSOs identified by the district administration. At each district, administration and civil society organizations (GO-CSO) coordination committees will be set up to perform hosts of activities with an aim to track, trace and prevent the spread of the virus. Detailing on some of the objectives, Singh said, “The key tasks will include interventions required for bringing down the impact of the virus on common people and the vulnerable sections including children, migrant workers, women headed families etc during the pandemic. Concert the efforts of CSOs and government for co-ordinated, quick, and effective response, taking help from civil society organizations and community-based organizations or agencies for emergency response, mobilising and pooling resources available with CSOs and government towards co-ordinated action, measure and monitor the progress on a regular basis and also document efforts and results achieved.” The department has also drafted several ‘to-do’ things under this mission. “At district levels, district support centres (DSCs) will be established which will be further linked with block support centres and panchayat centres. The volunteers list of the district, block, panchayat and village will be available with the DSC. On the other hand, DSC will be linked with emergency services or helplines available at the district for carrying out co-ordinated works at the grassroot level,” informed another official. “This apart, activities like social mobilisation, creation of awareness, providing support to migrant workers and vulnerable families hit by Covid, identification of Covid orphans among a host of other activities will also be performed under this mission,” he added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-98
20-07-2021||Jharkhand||Koderma: Home Guard commits suicide, kin hold commandant responsible||Rajesh Sharma, a resident of Karma West Lane of Jhumritilaiya town in Koderma district, chose to end his life, during the wee hours of Monday. The family of the deceased jawan is holding Home Guard commandant Dhiraj Jha accountable for forcing Sharma to take such an extreme step. According to his brother Sanjeet Sharma, the jawan was not being commissioned any duty by his senior Jha. This, Sanjeet believes disturbed his brother mentally. Accusing Jha of being corrupt, Sanjeet further added, “The duty commandant was charging money to assign work. My brother had taken Rs.3000 from his mother in the recent past to pay his senior. Again he made a demand of Rs.5000, on not getting it, he was not assigning work to my brother.” According to Sanjeet, Rajesh went to sleep after having dinner with the family the previous night. Early morning when his wife Sumitra Kumari woke up, she saw him hanging from the ceiling fan in another room of the house. Following which she raised an alarm, which led to people assembling at the jawan’s residence and the police being informed. Assistant sub-inspector Luv Kumar who reached the house to send the dead body for post-mortem to Sadar hospital said, “A probe has been initiated to know the reason behind Rajesh ending his life. The statement of family members has been recorded.” Koderma deputy superintendent of police, Sanjeev Kumar confirmed suicide. He said, “We have not received any complaint regarding him being tortured by commandant for duty.” However, he added that a probe would be initiated, if someone approached the police officially.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-98
20-07-2021||Jharkhand||Jharkhand asks centre to allot 95 % jabs through govt channel||Citing ‘challenging circumstances’ in vaccinating its entire population amid limited availability of private hospitals, Jharkhand has once again urged the Centre to alter the ratio and allot at least 95 per cent of the Covid-19 shots through the government route. This comes close on heels of the Jharkhand government last month asserting that ‘artificial’ tie-up of 25 per cent vaccination in private hospitals may result in many citizens missing the jabs and emphasising the need for reducing the allocation to private hospitals to 5 per cent from 25 per cent. “We have again requested the Centre to reduce the allocation to the private hospitals to 5 per cent as a major constraint in the state is limited availability of private hospitals to cater the rural and tribal population,” said Additional Chief Secretary Health, Arun Kumar Singh. Private hospitals have made requisitions for procuring barely 1.20 lakh vaccine doses out of 8.28 lakh allocated for them for the month of July, he said, adding these requisitions came from hospitals in three districts only. The state government has been emphasising that the mandate for 75:25 allocation format of Covid vaccines to the government and the private institutions needs to be reconsidered keeping in view the doctrine of colourable legislation (What cannot be done directly, should also not be done indirectly). Singh in a letter to the Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote: “This is to bring to your kind notice that in order to achieve 100 per cent vaccination, a major constraint in the state is limited availability of private hospitals to cater to rural and tribal population. ...it was requested to reduce the share of vaccination in private hospitals from 25% to 5% for the state of Jharkhand, against which, response is yet to be received.” Asserting that the state left no stone unturned in vaccinating eligible population in least time frame, Singh said private hospitals in the state have made request for procuring less than 15 per cent of the allocation earmarked for them for the month of July. He also mentioned that only 19 private health facilities from three districts have come forward for procurement out of 24 districts in the state. “As per allocation received from Government of India ..., 8,28,390 doses of Covid-19 vaccine are earmarked for private hospitals for the month of July 21. Against the aforementioned allocation, till date, requests from only 19 private facilities across 3 out of 24 districts of the state have been received from procurement of vaccines aggregating only 1,20,600 doses for the month of July which is less than 15% of the quantity earmarked by Government of India,” the letter mentions. The state urged the Centre to correct the anomaly expeditiously to facilitate total vaccination of all the eligible beneficiaries. “In light of the above facts and challenging circumstances, it is once again requested to reduce the share of vaccination in private hospitals and allocate 95% vaccines to the state of Jharkhand from the government route to enable equitable distribution of vaccines,” the letter said. The state government has earlier pleaded that its more than 75 per cent population living in the rural areas have negligible reach to private hospitals. Earlier, the Odisha government had also sought tweaking the share of vaccines to 95:5. The state had said, even in cities where private hospitals are available, on account of lack of purchasing parity, demand for Covid-19 vaccine on payment basis is very limited as Below Poverty Line (BPL) population across the state is more than 37 per cent. It said the overall objective of the government is to achieve 100 per cent vaccination, leaving no one behind, at the least possible time frame. The revised guidelines for implementation of the National Covid Vaccination Programme issued by the Government of India states that vaccine manufacturers shall provide 25 per cent of the production to private hospitals who can administer the vaccine on payment of vaccine purchase price and applicable service charge per dose. In Jharkhand of the 24 districts in the state, 13 districts are notified as Tribal districts and 19 districts are listed as Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected districts wherein hesitancy in vaccination has been a key challenge in the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-98
