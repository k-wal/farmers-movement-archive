28-07-2021||Calcutta||Covid: Enforce night curfew strictly, says chief secretary ||The chief secretary on Tuesday asked all police commissioners, police superintendents and the excise department to step up vigil on all major thoroughfares to ensure strict compliance of the 9pm-to-5am curfew, which is imposed every night to contain the spread of Covid. A senior bureaucrat said chief secretary H.K. Diwedi said at a meeting how the night curfew was being flouted and stressed the need to stop it immediately. “He said unless close watch is kept on the Covid situation, things may again spiral out of control,” the official said. The instruction came on a day Metro reported how diners drove in throughout the night at dhabas on Ballygunge Circular Road. Metro saw over two weekend nights food being served to people in cars and in the dining areas inside the eateries well past 9pm — when no one should be on the roads except those in medical emergencies or engaged in essential services. “Sir (chief secretary) was very clear. He said it has been observed that restrictions imposed from 9pm to 5am are being flouted with impunity in most districts, by the public and commercial establishments like restaurants. He requested the police chiefs to deploy flying squads and naka checking on all major thoroughfares to ensure compliance,” the officer said. According to the night curfew rules, people are expected to stay indoors from 9pm to 5am and those caught flouting the rule are to be prosecuted. Hotels, restaurants and eateries are to be closed by 8pm, as part of Covid curbs. Hours after the directive, Metro on Tuesday evening called one of the two dhabas that were serving food on Friday and Saturday night, asking whether a table could be reserved for a group of four later in the night. “We will not serve food after 9pm,” the person who answered the call said. Asked if they would serve in the car, the person said: “We will deliver only through... (he named two online food aggregators).” Officers of the East traffic guard on Tuesday downed the shutters of the eateries at 8.12pm, citing the Covid-19 restrictions. “Only online delivery services will be allowed,” an officer said. An officer at Lalbazar said: “Only the take-away counter (of an eatery) can operate during the curfew period. People are not allowed to step out and go to a take-away counter to collect food. Only online delivery, which has been included in emergency services, is allowed between 9pm and 5am.” On Friday and Saturday, the nearest police personnel Metro spotted was near Ballygunge Phari, about 1.5km from the dhabas. They stopped some vehicles and sought explanations. The dhabas were happily serving food to whoever came. Senior officers of Calcutta police said they had been instructed on Tuesday to tighten the security checking at night and ensure that “everything” was closed by 9pm.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-36
28-07-2021||Calcutta||Fake IPS officer arrested after extortion attempt in Calcutta||A man who allegedly pretended to be an IPS officer and travelled in a beacon-fitted car was arrested on Monday night. Rajarshi Bhattacharya, the accused, allegedly posed as an officer of the National Investigation Agency and tried to extort money from a Calcuttan, threatening to arrest him if he did not pay up. Police said the 45-year-old resident of Belghoria, on the northern outskirts of the city, refused to talk to anyone other than an “IPS officer” after his arrest, following which an IPS officer from Lalbazar questioned him. “He said he just wanted to wear the khaki uniform of IPS officers once and got a uniform stitched. However, we have learnt from his ‘guard’ and driver that he was in the habit of flaunting his uniform. He went to star hotels for coffee wearing it, pretending to be a senior officer,” an officer said. Bhattacharya is said to have told the police that he had thrown his “uniform” into the Hooghly. The police are yet to verify the claim. Officers said they found out during investigation that Bhattacharya was a physics graduate from a south Calcutta college. His late father taught at a south Calcutta college and then at a university, the officers said. “The accused was maintaining his charade till his wig came off and he started fumbling,” said an officer. After he purportedly admitted that he was lying, Bhattacharya claimed that he was involved in trading in paintings. The police are yet to verify this. Bhattacharya has been booked for cheating, impersonation of a public servant and extortion. Two others — Abhijit Das, whom he had hired from a private security agency to be his guard, and Mohammad Sikandar, who drove his vehicles — have also been arrested. “Das and Sikandar have claimed that they were under the impression that Bhattacharya was a real IPS officer,” said an officer. Sources said a 0.32 licenced gun with six rounds of cartridges were found in Bhattacharya’s possession. “The gun has not been seized because he has a valid licence for it. We are trying to find out how he got the licence,” an officer said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-36
28-07-2021||Calcutta||Covid: Queue chaos outside CMC vaccination centres  ||Chaotic scenes outside most Covid vaccination centres run by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) have become a daily affair. People join the queue while it’s still dark and wait for hours only to be told they cannot be vaccinated that day because of shortage of doses. The lucky ones who do get the jab return home after standing in the queue for as long as seven to eight hours. On Tuesday, people started queuing up outside some of the Covid vaccination centres at 2am or 3am. Some of them who arrived a “bit late” — around 5am — learnt around 10.30am that the centre would run out of doses before their turn came. Dipankar Bhowmick, a resident of Kasba, arrived outside a vaccination centre in Kasba’s Jadavgarh at 5.30am on Tuesday. There were already around 1,000 people in the queue. “I waited in the queue for five hours. Around 10.30am, employees of the CMC came and said they had received only 200 doses of Covaxin. They distributed coupons for Covishield first and then for Covaxin. The 200 Covaxin coupons were exhausted before my turn came,” Bhowmick recounted. He said he would join the queue on Wednesday at 2am. Bhowmick said four members of his family were waiting for their second dose of Covaxin. He visited two private hospitals but was deterred from taking the jabs there because of the cost. The hospitals are charging Rs 1,400 for one dose of Covaxin. Another Calcuttan said he had joined the queue at a CMC clinic at 1am last Saturday to get a coupon which would ensure a jab. “Officials announced around 8am that coupons would not be distributed because of shortage of doses. They could have made the announcement or displayed a notice earlier. That could have saved us from harassment,” the man said. For people like Bhowmick there is no option but to wait under the sun and in rain to get vaccinated. Long queues, often stretching 100 metres or so, are seen outside most CMC vaccination centres daily. The physical distancing norm, a must to prevent infection, is hardly followed in the queues. Frequent altercations break out if anyone suspects a person is jumping the queue, as most people remain agitated waiting for so long. The areas outside the gates of the vaccination centres and primary health centres, as well as the space inside, remain crowded with people waiting to get vaccinated. The chaos has only been aggravated by the scarcity of vaccine doses, especially Covaxin. The CMC has decided to administer only the second dose of Covaxin for now to ensure that no one misses out on the second jab, said Atin Ghosh, a member of the CMC’s board of administrators who is in charge of the civic body’s health department. “We will administer only the second dose of Covaxin. No second dose recipient will be turned away,” he said. CMC doctors, however, said they had no option but to turn away prospective recipients if doses got exhausted for the day. “It often happens that there are more people in the queue than the number of doses we have received. Our hands are tied. We always advise people who are being turned away to come back the next day,” said a senior CMC doctor who is managing vaccination in a part of Calcutta. In Bidhannagar, identical scenes are witnessed outside vaccination centres. At least 10 centres run by the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation have been shut down because of shortage of doses, an official of the civic body. “Only Matri Sadan Hospital in Salt Lake’s EE Block and Narayanpur Matri Sadan Hospital in Rajarhat are administering shots,” an official said. “But these two centres are struggling because a large number of people are queuing up.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-36
28-07-2021||Calcutta||Rise in Covid patients at private hospitals in Calcutta ||The number of Covid patients getting admitted to private hospitals in Calcutta is increasing again but the demand for vaccines at these facilities has reduced significantly, leaving public health experts worried about a fresh wave of infections. Several hospitals said admissions in critical care units had gone up, too, and some are planning to increase the number of beds in August. The state government at a meeting with district administrations on Tuesday stressed the need to ramp up Covid tests and vaccinations, and introduce stricter rules to ensure mask mandate compliance, officials said. Most hospitals have been seeing an uptick in admission of Covid patients over the past three or four days. The Telegraph has been reporting how people have been dropping their guard since the government started relaxing Covid instructions. Despite a 9pm-to-5am curfew, cars were seen parked outside dhabas on Ballygunge Circular Road and waiters were serving food on weekend nights. In public areas, many people are being spotted without masks. At Belle Vue Clinic, all beds in the Covid ward were vacant over the last weekend. On Tuesday, there were 17 patients, 10 of whom were in the critical care unit. “We have observed a sudden spurt in the number of admissions. Most of the patients are in a critical condition. If this trend continues, we have to increase the number of beds again,” said Pradip Tondon, the CEO of Belle Vue. The Loudon Street hospital had around 200 Covid beds during the peak of the second wave, in May. It reduced the bed count to 33 after the number of cases started falling in the beginning of July. Tondon said the footfall for vaccination at the hospital had reduced significantly over the last few days. The hospital vaccinated around 700 people daily last week. The figure has since come down to 200 to 300 and most of the people turning up are second dose recipients. “We are continuing our offsite vaccination programme, where around 3,000 people are being vaccinated daily. We are conducting the drive at places like Haldia, Asansol, Kalyani and Baruipur, and also in Calcutta,” said Tondon. At Peerless Hospital, the average occupancy in the Covid ward was six for a few weeks. The patient count over the last couple of days has gone up to 17. “All seven ICU beds are occupied. Last week, there were only two to three patients in the ICU. We are thinking of augmenting the number of beds in August, if the upward trend continues,” said Sudipta Mitra, the chief executive of Peerless Hospital. The hospital had 175 Covid beds during the peak of the pandemic this year. Now, it has 40. Mitra said the rate of positivity of Covid test results had also gone up sharply over the last couple of days, from around 2 per cent daily to 5 per cent. The vaccination footfall, on the other hand, has dropped sharply from a daily average of more than 500 to around 300. “We have vaccine doses but there are not enough takers,” Mitra said. At the RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, too, the rate of positivity has gone up but the demand for vaccination has gone down. “The positivity rate has gone up from an average of 2 per cent daily to 4 per cent. But the number of people coming to get vaccinated every day has gone down from around 1,000 to 600,” said R. Venkatesh, regional director, east, Narayana Health, which runs the Mukundapur hospital. At Charnock Hospital in New Town, the number of Covid patients admitted has gone up from 16 a few days back to 20 now. “Like other hospitals, we, too, reduced the number of Covid beds as cases started falling. But now it has started increasing again and we are keeping watch,” said Ipsita Kundu, the CEO of Charnock Hospital. She said the demand for vaccination has gone down at her hospital, too. “Earlier, we could not administer the jab to more than 100 people daily because of shortage of doses. Now, not even 100 people are coming to get vaccinated,” Kundu said. Doctors said the sudden spurt could be because of relaxation of curbs and violation of Covid norms. “The patients being admitted are not from a particular area. They are from across Calcutta and its surrounding areas. Most of them are unvaccinated,” said Chandramouli Bhattacharya, an expert in infectious diseases and tropical medicine, attached to Peerless Hospital. Bhattacharya, part of the Covid treatment team at the hospital, said it could be a warning signal of a fresh wave but it was too early to say anything definitely. A senior health department official said they were keeping a close watch on the situation. On Tuesday, at a meeting with district administrations, state government officials stressed the need to make people wear masks and scale up testing and vaccination. “We have identified districts and areas where many people are not wearing masks. The district administrations of those places have been asked to enforce norms strictly,” said Ajay Chakraborty, Bengal’s director of health services. He said the state government is giving priority to vaccinating people in slum areas of urban and semi-urban areas.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-36
28-07-2021||Calcutta||Stan Swamy’s death is a moment of awakening: Stanislaus D’Souza||The death of Father Stan Swamy is “not an end” but a “moment of awakening in the journey to affirm our faith in the Constitution of our country”, the Jesuit Provincial of India, Reverend Stanislaus D’Souza, has said. He has also urged people to mark July 28 as National Justice Day. In Calcutta, a prayer service will be held at the Archbishop’s House and St Xavier’s College on Wednesday evening in memory of the 84-year-old Jesuit priest who died in custody earlier this month. The Roman Catholic archdiocese of Calcutta has sent an email to all 65 churches and institutions in its fold encouraging them to organise a prayer meeting on Wednesday for the priest. Cardinal Oswald Gracias, the archbishop of Bombay and president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India, has written to all bishops in an email: “Each bishop can see what is most suitable for his region. I know this is a short notice and communication is neither fast nor easy.… A memorial service like this will help to keep alive in our hearts the desire to work for the poor and neglected.” Reverend D’Souza, also the president of the Jesuit Conference of India, has said in his statement: “Stan’s death is not an end; it is yet another moment of awakening in our journey to affirm our faith in the Constitution of our country. Stan has joined the company of Adivasi martyrs and all those who sacrificed their lives to protect the secular and democratic fabric and diverse cultures of our nation.” The statement says: “Stan’s death is a moment of deep consolation, as he has united people across cultures, religions and nationalities to walk boldly and courageously in the path of justice to human family and creation.” The events of July 28 will be organised “to pay our deep respects to Fr. Stan Swamy SJ and carry forward his legacy”, the statement adds. Reverend D’Souza has also urged Indians not to be silent spectator “amidst growing inequalities, violence, atrocities, discrimination and exclusion in our country”. Father Stan “inspired us to sing the values of the Preamble to the Constitution of our country — Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity — amidst the adversities…. As a Jesuit, he committed himself to walk with the excluded, whose dignity is violated, in a mission of Reconciliation and Justice,” Reverend D’Souza’s statement says. Through his lifelong accompaniment of the Adivasis, Dalits and marginalised communities and "by his martyrdom he has given us a new ethical mandate to be compassionate, to be the voice of the voiceless and defenders of human rights, speaking truth to power," the Jesuit Provincial of India’s statement says. “The prayer meeting is to create awareness... that we can no longer be mere spectators, but it is time to plunge into action and raise our voices against the prevailing injustices,” said Father Dominic Gomes, the vicar general of the archdiocese of Calcutta.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-36
28-07-2021||Calcutta||Unions of yellow/metered taxis threaten two-day strike||Several unions of yellow/metered taxis have threatened a 48-hour strike beginning August 12 if the state government does not respond to their pleas for a fare hike. Earlier, the CPM’s labour arm Citu had called a taxi strike on August 6 and 7 demanding fare revision. There are around 14,000 metered taxis in the city. For the last few years, the owners have been saying the existing fare is not in sync with the cost of fuel and other operational expenses. The Bengal government had last revised the fares in 2018 when the lowest fare, for the first 2km, was fixed at Rs 30. Thereafter, the fare would increase by Rs 3 for every additional 200 metres. On Tuesday, taxi owners demanded that the lowest fare be fixed at Rs 50 for the first 2km. Thereafter, they said, the fare should increase by Rs 5 per 200 metres. “The price of diesel is Rs 93.02 a litre. Three years back, on the same date, the price was Rs 71.08 a litre. There has been a rise of over Rs 20 a litre but the fares have remained the same,” said Bimal Guha of the Bengal Taxi Association. “How can this be feasible for taxi operators?” For some time now, most taxi operators across Calcutta have stopped agreeing to ferry passengers at metered fares. Instead, they quote a lump sum for any destination, anytime of the day. Several taxi drivers on Tuesday said the metered fare had long ceased to exist for all practical purposes but the government would not admit it. “There aren’t enough passengers…. Many drivers prefer to keep their vehicles parked at home,” said Shyamal Maity, a yellow cab driver.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-37
28-07-2021||Calcutta||Covid: Autumn semester at IIT Kharagpur to be online||IIT Kharagpur has informed students, barring 500 who are facing resource constraints, that they will continue to attend online classes in the autumn semester as the authorities want to “avoid the life risk to students by calling them to the campus”. The autumn semester continues from July to December. The 500 students who are facing resource constraints will be called back so they can use the institute’s facilities to attend online classes. An email addressed to BTech students on July 23 says that since “the risk of infection in the cities and towns remain high” and “travel restrictions continue to be in place”, they won’t be recalled until the situation becomes conducive. According to an institute official, most of the students want to return to the campus as they have “got bored and tired attending classes from home” and feel that a hostel life, even with adherence to Covid protocols, will be a welcome change. Unstable Net connectivity at home is also prompting many to request the authorities to allow them to return to the campus. The email to the students, on behalf of the dean of students’ affairs and three other deans, says: “You are aware that the Covid-19 situation is still not in complete control…. Efforts are being made to bring students to the campus when the situation becomes conducive to do so in a phased manner. However, until the situation warrants, with a view to avoid life risk to the students..., director as Chairman of the senate has approved… the Autumn Semester will be completely through online mode.” The dean of students’ affairs, Dhrubajyoti Sen, said the 500 BTech students encountering digital divide, who would be brought back from August 2 in batches, would also attend online classes using the facilities in hostels. “As for bringing others, we want to go slow as the situation has not become conducive yet,” Sen said. An official of the institute said they wanted to keep a cap on the presence of BTech students to avoid any assembly on the campus, which had to be shut for about a fortnight last September following a spurt in Covid cases. “The 500 students will stay in hostels. If we bring more students, this will create an assembly.... we have to exercise caution,” he said. The return of IIT Roorkee students to the campus in April, when the second wave was under way and Kumbh Mela was being held, triggered a surge in cases there, said an IIT Kharagpur official. “Learning lessons from that incident, all the IITs have become cautious,” he said. Another official said some of the research scholars were already on the campus and a cap had been set on their presence as well. Altogether 900 research scholars stay on the campus as of now and a fresh batch will be called once a section of the scholars leaves on completion of research. The mail addressed to the BTech students says: “In line with the last two semesters the following components of the fees are exempted: electricity and water charges, mess advance, hostel overhead charges, hall budget and technology film society fees.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-37
28-07-2021||Calcutta||Artificial limbs distributed with Covishield jabs in Calcutta||Scores of people without limbs got prosthetic legs and Covid-19 vaccines at a camp organised by young entrepreneurs on Sunday. Around 150 people attended the camp at Ekbalpore. Over 70 people got artificial limbs. Each beneficiary, along with a family member, also got the first dose of Covishield. The camp was organised by Young Indians, the youth wing of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). The recipients included people with deformed limbs since birth. Some had to get a part of, or the entire limb, amputated after an accident or gangrene. One of them was Susmita Chakraborty, 27. Her right leg is around 7.5 inch shorter than the left. She was born with the disorder. “My parents deserted me because of the disorder when I was barely three-and-a-half years old,” said Chakraborty, who lives with her maternal grandmother at Kanchrapara in North 24-Parganas, 50km from Calcutta. Her parents live in Siliguri with her younger sister. Her grandmother is a retired railway employee and her pension sustains the family of two. Despite her physical condition, Chakraborty aspires to become a dancer. She does not have any formal training but has participated in reality shows. So far, a caliper (a metal support) held her right leg. On Sunday, she got a prosthetic leg as well as a Covid shot. The upper portion of the limb is made of plastic. The appendage or the foot portion is made of rubber for flexibility. “This is like a new lease of life. The limb will help me chase my dream of becoming a dancer,” said Chakraborty. The Covid vaccination drive has not made sufficient inroads into India’s vast population of differently abled people, said rights activists. “There are many free vaccination camps organised by the government as well as NGOs. But because of mobility challenges, it is difficult for many differently abled people to make it to the camps. So far, the state has failed them,” said a rights activist who did not want to be named because she works with the government on several projects. “We believe in making the country self-reliant and bring the underprivileged into mainstream society. We have set ourselves a target of providing 10,000 artificial limbs in two years. We have already covered over 900. The vaccination drive is an added effort because of the pandemic,” said Arpit Dhandhania, the chairperson of the Calcutta chapter of Young Indians. Most of the beneficiaries on Sunday came from economically backward sections. The organisation had associated with Mahavir Seva Sadan, an NGO, for the drive to provide artificial limbs. The NGO is behind Jaipur Foot, the renowned brand of affordable prosthetic limbs. “Every Sunday, a group of differently abled people come to the Sadan’s office at Ekbalpore to give measurements for the tailormade limbs. Next Sunday, the group gets the limbs,” said Sohan Raj Singhvi of the Sadan. “In the recent past, our Covid task force has already set up an oxygen support system, donated ambulances for patient transfer and already provided more than 15,000 vaccine doses through various camps. We will continue the limb distribution and the vaccination drive together for two more Sundays,” said Vaibhav Soni, the co-chairman of the Calcutta chapter of Young Indians.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-37
28-07-2021||Calcutta||Police arrest 14 people for operating fake call centres in Calcutta||The city police arrested fourteen persons from two locations on Monday night for allegedly running fake call centres. Eleven of the arrested were allegedly making Internet calls to people in the UK, pretending to be representatives of the customer care wing of the e-commerce giant Amazon. The remaining three were allegedly posing as employees of another US-based company and trying to cheat people by offering web-based services like web designing and market strategies on Google, the police said. The 11 were arrested by the anti-rowdy squad of the detective department from a room on the third floor of the Webel IT Park building in Taratala. An officer at Lalbazar said the raid at the Webel IT Park was based on a “specific tip-off”. The police allegedly caught the racketeers making Internet calls to people in the UK posing as Amazon representatives. The police have been tracking several illegal call centres across the city over the past few weeks. They have unearthed rackets that were allegedly cheating people abroad by pretending to be employees of Amazon. A police officer said the racketeers would use different types of tricks to lure people to buy a product online and then cheat them by accessing their mobile phones or laptops by sending a link for screen sharing. “The first step was to call a potential buyer and play an electronic voice saying Amazon was offering discounts on certain products and to know more, the person should connect with the representative of the shopping portal. If the potential buyer agreed and dialed the number to connect to a representative, the latter would convince him or her to open a link on his computer or smartphone to access the directory of products that had discounts on them,” said an officer. Once the person would click on the link, a spyware would be installed on his or her device and it would enable the racketeers to access the Net banking details of the victim, the officer said. The other three accused, who were allegedly trying to dupe people by offering web-based services, were picked up by officers of Karaya police station from a building on Tiljala Road. The gang was allegedly targeting people in the UK, the US and Canada. All 14 were produced in court on Tuesday. They have been remanded in police custody.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-37
28-07-2021||Business||Covid-19: IMF forecasts 6% global growth this year as economies reopen||The International Monetary Fund is sharply upgrading its economic outlook this year for the world's wealthy countries, especially the United States, as Covid-19 vaccinations help sustain solid rebounds from the pandemic recession. But the 190-country lending agency has downgraded its forecast for poorer countries, most of which are struggling to vaccinate. Overall, the IMF said Tuesday that it expects the global economy to expand 6% this year — a dramatic bounce-back from the 3.2% contraction in the pandemic year of 2020. The IMF's forecast, unchanged from its previous estimate in April, would mark the fastest calendar-year global growth in records dating to 1980. Beneath the worldwide number, however, a gap between the vaccine haves and have-nots is widening. The IMF expects advanced economies to grow 5.6% this year, an upgrade from the 5.1% it forecast in April, fueled by the swift recovery of consumers and businesses. But it downgraded its 2021 forecast for emerging market and developing countries to 6.3% from its April forecast of 6.7%. Advanced economies, in which close to 40% of the population has been vaccinated, are largely reopening after last year's Covid-19 lockdowns. But in developing and emerging market countries, the vaccination rate is just 11%. Moreover, the governments of poorer countries cannot match the outpouring of government spending that rich countries have been using to propel their economic recoveries. The United States is expected to register 7% growth this year, a sharp reversal from last year's 3.5% drop and an upgrade from the 6.4% growth the IMF had forecast for 2021 back in April. President Joe Biden's ambitious spending plans are expected to fuel growth this year and next. The IMF predicts that the U.S. economy will grow 4.9% in 2022, up from the 3.5% it projected three months ago. The 19 European countries that share the euro currency are forecast to grow 4.6% collectively this year, versus last year's 6.5% contraction. Japan, which endured a 4.7% drop in economic growth in 2020, is expected to expand 2.8% this year. But the 2021 forecast for Japan marks a downgrade from what the IMF expected in April, reflecting a resurgence of Covid-19 cases earlier this year. In the developing world, the outlook for China, the world's second-largest economy after the United States, was marked down to 8.1% after the government scaled back spending and investment. Despite the brighter outlook for major economies, the outlook across the world has been clouded by uncertainty over the delta variant of the coronavirus and the uneven progress of vaccination campaigns. “The recovery is not assured until the pandemic is beaten back globally,'' Gita Gopinath, the IMF's chief economist, wrote in a blog post.     In the update to its World Economic Outlook, the IMF expressed concern that any major resurgence of inflation would pressure the world's central banks into raising interest rates and thereby threatening the global recovery. Still, it expects inflation to return to pre-pandemic levels in most countries next year.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-127

Last year, the government raised insurance cover on deposit five-folds to Rs 5 lakh to provide support to depositors of ailing lenders like Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank. Following the collapse of PMC Bank, Yes Bank and Lakshmi Vilas Bank too came under stress, leading to restructuring by the regulator and the government. The amendment to the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) Act, 1961 is the budget announcement made by the Finance Minister. The Bill is expected to be introduced in the current monsoon session, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, while sharing details about the Cabinet meeting. Once the Bill becomes law, it will provide immediate relief to thousands of depositors, who had their money parked in stressed lenders such as PMC Bank and other small cooperative banks. As per the current provisions, the deposit insurance of up to Rs 5 lakh comes into play when the licence of a bank is cancelled and the liquidation process starts. DICGC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India, provides insurance cover on bank deposits.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-127

"Domestic equities extended losses as weak cues from global markets triggered by selling pressure in Chinese tech stocks due to regulatory overhang weighed on sentiments," said Binod Modi, Head Strategy at Reliance Securities. Further, persistent selling pressure in financials led by concerns over asset quality dragged the benchmark index. However, positive cues from European markets and buy on dips helped market to recover from the day's low in the second half, he added. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai and Tokyo ended with losses, while Hong Kong and Seoul closed with gains. Equities in Europe were trading on a positive note in mid-session deals.

The report of the department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Industry on the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector has noted that in the process of economic recovery post-first wave of the pandemic, the second wave has even more vigorously ripped the economy particularly the MSME sector. "The committee observes that the stimulus package announced by the government for the economic revival from the pandemic hit economy has been found to be inadequate as the measures adopted were more of loan offering and long-term measures instead of improving the cash flow to generate demand as immediate relief," it said. It has recommended that the government should immediately come out with a larger economic package aimed at bolstering demand, investment, exports and employment generation to help the economy, including MSMEs to recover from the pandemic fall-out. In their submission to the committee, various MSME associations have stated that due to a sharp fall in business, most of the MSMEs faced an acute cash crunch and needed immediate liquidity to cope with the unprecedented circumstance. "It is estimated that almost 25 per cent of MSME loans could slip into default as several MSMEs are finding it tough to draw working capital from banks," the associations told the committee, as per the report, which was released on Tuesday. Expressing concern over the grim situation of small enterprises due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the committee has recommended that to ensure the survival of small enterprises, it is imperative for the government to provide them with much-needed liquidity support to keep their businesses running and generate job opportunities for the workforce. It said that a detailed study needs to be conducted to make an assessment of the actual losses suffered by the MSME sector so as to chalk out an effective plan for revival of the sector. Observing that a large number of jobs were lost due to the pandemic, the committee said that a new National Employment Policy may be considered along with exploring the feasibility of establishing a National Electronic Employment Exchange and building a skill-based database to provide employment to skilled manpower in their area of expertise. Further, it suggested that strict provisions against delayed payments need to be put in place to ensure timely release of payments by CPSEs which will immensely help the MSMEs to meet their working capital/credit requirements. "... necessary guidelines should be issued for mandatory reporting of the delayed/pending payments (beyond 45 days) to MSMEs, by CPSEs/PSUs in their Annual Reports, in a separate section, as it would impress upon the CPSEs/PSUs to make payments to MSMEs in a time-bound manner," it added. On the Emergency Credit Linked Guarantee Scheme, it stated that the scheme has recorded a high success rate, yet, around 50 per cent of the total guarantee amount only has been issued to MSMEs. The banks should be more liberal at this juncture in extending credit facilities to MSMEs and ensure that loans are disbursed without delay after sanction, it suggested, adding the 90 days limit fixed by RBI for classifying overdues of MSMEs should be increased to 180 days. On e-commerce, it said that the MSME ministry may study the working of big e-commerce players to adopt efficient and successful practices for strengthening the entry and survival of the sector in e-commerce. "Availability of soft loans to MSMEs at a minimal interest rate of 3-4 per cent with extended repayment tenure, easy land acquisition, less parameters of compliances etc could help in developing import substitution in the country," it said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-127

"The selloff in Chinese tech stocks on Beijing's regulatory crackdown has triggered concerns about whether this selloff will spread to other segments. China is too big now. It can cause flutters in global markets," he said. A significant trend in the market now is sectoral shifts, he noted, adding that there has been across the board selling in pharma stocks in the previous session. "Profits booked in this segment are moving into other sectors. The relative outperformance in frontline financials indicates a sectoral shift." Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo were trading with losses in mid-session deals. Equities on Wall Street too ended on a negative note in overnight sessions.

The airline’s total expenses increased  59.2 per cent to Rs 6,344 crore from Rs 3,986 crore in the year-ago period. CEO Ronojoy Dutta said: “Our financial results for the first quarter were severely impacted by the second Covid wave. The number of passengers travelling declined sharply in the months of May and June. With the second wave receding, IndiGo is seeing a measured recovery in bookings for July and August.”. “Notwithstanding the industry’s present challenges, we remain firmly optimistic about IndiGo’s future. Our entire focus during this pandemic has been to manage our cash balances, run a high- quality airline and to continue to build our capabilities and be prepared for the post Covid environment,” he stated.

The airlines said revenues from operations at Rs 3,006.9 crore, however, increased 292.2 per cent from the year-ago period due to a low base. The year-ago quarter (Q1 FY21) was also hit hard by the first wave of Covid-19 that led to a nationwide lockdown. Passenger ticket revenues at Rs 2,297.6 crore increased by 292.5 per cent YoY and ancillary revenues at Rs 668.3 crore rose by 296 per cent compared with the same period last year. InterGlobe Aviation has a strong balance sheet with a total cash of Rs 17,067.9 crore, including free cash of Rs 5,620.7 crore. Given the current cash position, the company continued to evaluate the timing and the size of any QIP. The airline operated a peak of 1,262 daily flights and a minimum of 318 flights during the first quarter of FY22, including non-scheduled flights, the statement said. “We provided scheduled services to 66 domestic destinations and various international locations through passenger charters and air bubble flights,” it added. Capacity for the quarter was up by 433.2 percent compared to the same period last year, the airline said. With the number of infections decreasing in India, IndiGo said air traffic has started showing signs of recovery since the last week of May but the revenue environment remains uncertain.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-127

WBIDC chairman Rajiva Sinha on Tuesday said at a meeting organised by the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce that more than 150 large industries are present in the state. “Bengal has always been known as a sector leader in MSME. But many of us even in industry are not aware of the prowess of the state in terms of large industry. I am not talking about jute or tea. At WBIDC, we have started an exercise to identify the top 50 companies in Bengal ... and large industries by definition have a turnover of over Rs 250 crore. Today I was evaluating this with my officers, and already 156 companies are there and all are in the big bracket. You take a name and it is here,” he  said. The list is likely to be finalised soon and be available by the middle of August. While the state is open to all investors, the best prospects for investment however is from those who are already operating in the state. “Those who stay invested in Bengal, who are local industry leaders are the best people to expand and invest further in the state,” he said adding that these industries are already aware of the business, social and cultural environment and all these contribute to a business decision. Sinha further said that it is the industry’s role to identify the prospects, strengths and weaknesses and decide to invest. “Our role is facilitation. The experience of doing business in Bengal should be happy,” he said.

The Hyderabad-based pharma major also disclosed that it has received a subpoena from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the production of documents pertaining to certain CIS geographies. The two developments sent the DRL stock crashing on the bourses. DRL’s lacklustre scorecard follows a tepid performance from Alembic Pharmaceuticals on Monday.

In its report assessing the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on small and medium businesses, the parliamentary standing committee on industry said the poorly funded stimulus had merely offered  loans and some long-term measures but had failed to crank up cash flows to generate demand which would have provided “immediate succour” to a hobbled economy. The committee recommended that the government should immediately come out with a larger economic package aimed at bolstering demand, investment, exports and employment generation to help the economy, including MSMEs to recover from the fall-out of the pandemic. It urged the government to provide MSMEs with much-needed liquidity support to keep businesses running and generate job opportunities for the workforce. The report called for a new National Employment Policy and said the government should explore the feasibility of establishing a National Electronic Employment Exchange and build a skill-based database to provide employment to skilled manpower in their area of expertise. The report said the second wave of the coronavirus had smothered the nascent recovery after the first wave, with the MSME players hurt the most. The government had announced a stimulus package of Rs 20.97 lakh crore in tranches last year and in June, it offered another one worth Rs 6.28 lakh crore. It said the Reserve Bank of India should extend the tenure of classifying MSME loans as overdue to 180 days from 90 days at present so that working capital is not diverted towards paying loans and attention is not turned towards clearing dues at the cost of normal business operations. The panel said the biggest concern for the MSMEs was the availability of raw materials on time and at the right price as it alleged hoarding by the traders. K.E.Raghunathan, convenor, Consortium of Indian Associations (CIA) said “at last, we have a neutral report accepting the reality of the situation. Time and again the CIA has been maintaining that the life of  micro and small entrepreneurs are shattered and the government did not recognise their pains adequately”.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-128

Leaders of various opposition parties met in the morning and later submitted similar adjournment notices on the issue in both the Houses of Parliament. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attended the meeting of 14 opposition parties but the Trinamool Congress was not present. "The opposition is united for a discussion on the Pegasus issue... We are not going anywhere till it is discussed in Parliament," Gandhi told reporters in the presence of leaders of 13 other opposition parties later. He also rejected the government's charges over the disruption of Parliament and said the opposition was only fulfilling its responsibility. Gandhi attacked the government over the Pegasus spyware row, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah of "hitting the soul of India's democracy by snooping upon its institutions". The voice of the opposition is being suppressed in Parliament, he alleged. "We just have one question. Has the Government of India bought Pegasus, yes or no? Did the government use Pegasus weapon on its own people, yes or no? That is all we wish to know," he told reporters at Vijay Chowk. Gandhi also said the Pegasus spyware row "for us, is an issue of nationalism, treason". "This is not a matter of privacy. For me, it is anti-national work." Accusing PM Modi of using Pegasus spyware against the people of the country, Gandhi said, "This weapon has been used against India." "It should be used against terrorists. We are asking the prime minister and the home minister why did you use it against democratic institutions? What has Indian democracy done that you have used the weapon against democracy?" he posed. The government has been rejecting all opposition charges over the issue. At least 10 opposition parties gave adjournment notices in the Lok Sabha and at least six in the Rajya Sabha seeking a discussion on the Pegasus issue but were rejected by the Chair in both the Houses. Rahul Gandhi said the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are places "where we have to speak and everyone is united on a discussion on Pegasus". "The government is refusing to allow us a discussion. Obviously, the government has done something wrong, something dangerous for the country. That is the issue." "We want a discussion in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha where either the prime minister, who has ordered the action, or the home minister, who is a party to ordering that action, because no one else can do it, has to be present. Pegasus is a weapon sold by one country to another," Gandhi said. The former Congress chief said people need to understand that if the issue of Pegasus spyware is not discussed now, then the matter would be over. "The prime minister and the home minister have assaulted the democratic spirit of India. That is why we are seeking Pegasus discussion and without that, we will not go anywhere," Gandhi said. DMK's T R Baalu said the government has given an impression that the opposition parties are against holding discussions in Parliament. "It's not so. We wanted a discussion from day one. Every day, we are giving notices but the government is not coming forward for a discussion... It is a matter of great concern for democracy. Pegasus matter has to be taken very seriously. Like-minded people should come together to see that the matter is discussed," he said. Shiv Sena's Sanjay Raut alleged that "the government has indulged in backstabbing and attacked us with this weapon". Ram Gopal Yadav of the Samajwadi Party said the government's allegation that the opposition is running away from a discussion is "false propaganda". "No institution has been left out of this snooping and the truth will not come till a Supreme Court-monitored probe is conducted. The corruption in the Rafale deal is linked to this snooping issue," said Sanjay Singh of the AAP. NCP's Supriya Sule said the opposition parties were united in their demand for the discussion in Parliament on the snooping row. Later, Rahul Gandhi shared pictures of his meeting with opposition leaders on Twitter, claiming that they were all "united". "Sitting with the entire opposition is extremely humbling. Amazing experience, wisdom and insight in everyone present," Gandhi said in the tweet. An international media consortium has reported that over 300 verified mobile phone numbers, including of two ministers, over 40 journalists, three opposition leaders and one sitting judge besides scores of businesspersons and activists in India could have been targeted for hacking through the spyware.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-383

Madhya Pradesh leads the chart with 79 per cent seroprevalence while Kerala is at the bottom with 44.4 per cent. Seroprevalence in Assam is 50.3 per cent and Maharashtra 58 per cent. The findings of the fourth round of national serosurvey conducted by the ICMR across 70 districts of India was shared by the Union Health Ministry on Wednesday. Seroprevalence was found to be 76.2 per cent among the surveyed population in Rajasthan, 75.9 per cent in Bihar, 75.3 per cent in Gujarat, 74.6 per cent in Chhattisgarh, 73.1 per cent in Uttarakhand, 71 per cent in Uttar Pradesh, 70.2 per cent in Andhra Pradesh, 69.8 per cent in Karnataka, 69.2 in Tamil Nadu and 68.1 per cent in Odisha. Referring to the findings, the Health Ministry has advised states and union territories to conduct seroprevalence studies of their own in consultation with the ICMR to ensure that those studies follow a standardized protocol. The findings of such serosurveys can then be utilized quickly by the states to guide objective, transparent and evidence-based public health response to Covid-19. "The national sero-survey by ICMR was designed to capture the extent of the spread of Covid infection at the national level. Therefore, the national serosurvey results do not reflect the heterogeneity of seroprevalence between districts and even between states," a statement said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-384
28-07-2021||India||Parliament clears amendment Bill to strengthen juvenile justice law||Parliament passed the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Bill, which seeks to increase the role of district magistrates and additional district magistrates in matters concerning child care and adoption. The Bill was passed by Lok Sabha in March 2021. Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani moved the Bill in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday and it was passed amid a ruckus as the Opposition parties kept up their protests over Pegasus snooping row, farm laws and price rise. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Bill, 2021, which seeks to amend the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, proposes to increase the role of district magistrates and additional district magistrates in matters concerning child care and adoption, she said. "The children of our country deserve a united house to support the amendments proposed. The amendments empower the district magistrates, enhance CWC (child welfare committee) and enhance accountability. Hence I beseech that this House irrespective of its political differences stand together in service of our children," Irani said amid protests. According to the amendments, background and educational qualification checks will be included in the process of selection of a member of a child welfare committee. "If an individual has a record of violation of human rights, that individual can never be appointed as a member of the child welfare committee. If an individual is convicted of an offence involving moral turpitude and has not been granted pardon, that individual cannot serve as a member of the child welfare committee. If an individual has ever abused a child, employed a child labour or indulged in immoral acts, that individual cannot serve in the child welfare committee," Irani said. "To ensure that there is absolutely no conflict of interest, those individuals who run child care institutions or other NGOs that profit from the government, who are from the management part of child care institutions, they cannot be a part of child welfare committees," she said. The Bill also seeks to categorise offences wherein the maximum sentence is more than seven years' imprisonment but no minimum sentence or a minimum sentence of less than seven years has been provided as "serious offences" under the Juvenile Justice Act, and to remove difficulties in interpretation of the Act. "Serious offences" include those for which the punishment under the Indian Penal Code or any other law for the time being is imprisonment between three and seven years. The Bill intends to ensure that the district magistrate is suitably placed to ensure effective coordination among the stakeholders for facilitation of necessary services for children's rehabilitation or re-integration. By further empowering district magistrates to deal with child protection and adoption processes, it aims to facilitate a coordinated and effective response of the administration to various issues pertaining to children, including adoption, the Bill said. On the child welfare committee, the Bill said no person shall be appointed as a member unless he or she has been actively involved in health, education or welfare activities pertaining to children for at least seven years or is a practising professional with a degree in child psychology or psychiatry or law or social work or sociology or human development. The Bill further proposes that the appointment of any member of the committee shall be terminated by the state government, after making an inquiry, if they fail to attend the proceedings of the committee consecutively for three months without any valid reason or if they fail to attend less than three-fourths of the sittings in a year. The Bill makes the district magistrate the grievance redressal authority for the child welfare committee, and anyone connected with a child may file a petition before the official, who shall consider and pass appropriate orders.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-384

Extending the existing pandemic guidelines till August 31, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla also said there should be continuous focus on the five-fold strategy of 'test, track, treat, vaccinate and adhere to COVID-appropriate behaviour' for effective management of COVID-19. He also said there is a need to ensure adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB) in all crowded places in view of the upcoming festivals. In his communication to all states and union territories, Bhalla said that with the decline in the number of active cases, states and UTs are reopening economic and other activities in a gradual manner. "While the decline in the number of cases is a matter of satisfaction, it may be noted that the absolute case numbers are still significantly high," he said. Therefore, the home secretary said, there is no room for complacency and the process of relaxing restrictions should be carefully calibrated, as has been reiterated in his earlier communications. Bhalla said the reproduction number of the virus, commonly known as the 'R' factor, is hovering just below 1 but is high in some of the states. Referring to his letter dated July 14, the home secretary said all efforts should be made to ensure that there is no increase in the 'R' factor. "Further, strictest possible measures should be taken in the districts that are still showing high positivity rates. "In view of the upcoming festivals, there is need to ensure Covid Appropriate Behaviour (CAB) in all crowded places," he said. Bhalla urged state governments and UT administrations to issue strict directions to the district and all other local authorities to take necessary measures for Covid-19 management. "The officers concerned should be made personally responsible for any laxity in strict enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour. "I would also advise that Orders issued by the respective State governments and UT administrations, district authorities in this regard, should be widely disseminated to the public and to the field functionaries, for their proper implementation," he said. India logged 43,654 fresh Covid-19 cases taking its tally to 3,14,84,605, while 640 more fatalities pushed the death toll to 4,22,022, according to Union Health Ministry data on Wednesday. The number of active cases stood at 3,99,436, an increase of 1,336 in a span of 24 hours, and comprises 1.27 per cent of the total infections.

28-07-2021||India|| All of us have to come together to defeat BJP, says Mamata after meeting Sonia||Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee met UPA chairperson and Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi at her residence in Delhi on Wednesday afternoon, the first time after the Trinamul’s victory in the state elections in which the Congress was one of its rivals. "We had a very positive meeting. All of us have to come together to defeat the BJP. I am not a leader, I am a cadre," Mamata told newspersons after the meeting that lasted for around 45 minutes. "We will put up a united front." Wednesday’s meeting with Sonia is significant amid Opposition moves to join forces for a united fight in the 2024 national election. Mamata, who is scheduled to be Delhi for the week, had met with senior congress leaders Kamal Nath and Anand Sharma on Tuesday. Since her Bengal victory, Mamata Banerjee has emerged as a pivotal figure in the Opposition's attempts to unite to take on the BJP in the next general election. In Delhi for the first time after her thumping victory in the Bengal assembly elections, Mamata has lined up meetings with several key opposition leaders. "Poore desh me khela hoga. It's a continuous process...When general elections come (2024), it will be (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi vs country," she told reporters earlier in the day, according to ndtv.com. "After the Parliament session there will be talks, there should be a common platform to work together. I am meeting Arvind Kejriwal (too). I spoke to Lalu Prasad Yadav yesterday. We will be talking to all parties." On who could lead any Opposition front, she replied: "I am not a political astrologer, it depends on the situation." Asked to comment on the view that the Congress is now a weak link for the Opposition, Mamata said: "I don't want to interfere in the internal math of any political party. But I think Sonia Gandhi wants Opposition unity." Earlier in the day, at a meeting at Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Shekhar Roy’s residence in Delhi, around 30 MPs of the Trinamul Congress declared Mamata Banerjee as the leader of the Opposition unanimously for the 2024 general elections. "She will lead the battle for 2024 against the BJP. We want to see her as prime minister. All of us told her so," said Trinamul MP Kalyan Banerjee. Mamata's idea behind pitching for the 2024 polls from now is to keep up the momentum she has gained from this summer's assembly polls which she won decisively to stop the BJP on its tracks. But she is not the only chief minister to successfully thwart the BJP's regional ambitions. In Pinarayi Vijayan's Kerala, the BJP could not win a single seat. In Tamil Nadu, the MK Stalin- led alliance that includes the Congress and the Left also defeated the BJP. As of now though neither Vijayan nor Stalin have made any national noises. "It is too early to commit on a united front with poll projections from now. This has never been done," said a Congress MP. Having got herself declared as the chairperson of the Trinamul's parliamentary party, Mamata's visits to Delhi are likely to be more frequent in the coming months to keep reinforcing her claim as the most credible face against Modi. Even if she manages to stitch an alliance with the Congress in Bengal, it is unlikely to leave more than two seats for the grand old party. Without spelling out a seat-sharing formula,  simply announcing a PM face will not help create an Opposition front. Since the 2019 polls, most of the major Opposition parties have been jointly signing statements against the Modi government. These had signatures of leaders from both the Left and Trinamul. That does not necessarily translate into an electoral adjustment. Mamata's message to her party workers was to concentrate on proceedings within the House. Mamata warned the MPs against meeting BJP ministers individually and without permission from the leadership. "Some months ago, Dibyendu Adhikary went to meet Modi. There is a feeling some people could strike deals especially before polls," said a Trinamul source.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-384
28-07-2021||India||Delhi High Court asks Centre to draft national policy to protect kids from tech addiction||The Delhi High Court Wednesday asked the Centre to decide a representation seeking to formulate a national policy to protect children from online games addiction which is causing them psychological problems. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh asked the concerned authorities to decide the representation in accordance with the law, rules, regulations and government policy applicable to the case and disposed of a petition which also sought to constitute a regulatory authority to monitor and rate the content of both offline and online games. The petition filed by NGO, Distress Management Collective (DMC), through advocates Robin Raju and Deepa Joseph, said the organisation has been receiving numerous complaints from parents who are concerned about children getting addicted to online games, as a result of which the kids are developing various psychological problems. The counsel told the court that they have already made a representation to the authorities on July 10. The plea said some recent news of children committing suicides or going into depression, and also committing crimes like theft due to online game addiction, compelled the NGO to file the petition. "The pandemic period has posed a major problem in controlling and monitoring children from excessive gadget use. As classes are now online so parents are not in a position to reprimand children for being with a mobile phone like they did in the past. There are numerous studies that show the adverse impact of online games on the psyche of both young children (6-10 years) and adolescents (11-19 years), the plea said. It stressed on the need for schools to give emphasis to counselling sessions and periodic sessions regarding the drastic effects of getting addicted to online gaming and said there is also a need for a national policy that lays emphasis on the role of schools and the Cyber Cell in tackling the issue. Evil forces trying to brainwash, exploit kids via online Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday said "evil forces" are "deliberately" trying to brainwash children via various platforms like online gaming and the darknet and strict action is required against the same. Besides taking action against such entities, whose intent is to expolit children and push them towards extreme steps like suicide, awareness needs to be created among parents and children about the problems associated with such platforms, the chief minister said in response to a query in the Assembly on steps that can be taken to control the menace of online gaming. He also said parents need to be informed about the dangers of these platforms and children need to be counselled against such entities. Vijayan said more and more children are falling prey to these "evil forces" which are trying to enslave their minds and in some cases sexually exploit them. He said the brainwashing and exploitation was a continuous process and does not happen overnight. The chief minister said help from international agencies or groups, which in this particular field, can be sought to find a solution.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-384
28-07-2021||India||Trinamul MPs ‘declare’ Mamata as Opposition leader for 2024 elections||Around 30 MPs of the Trinamul Congress called out in one voice to anoint Mamata Banerjee as the leader of the Opposition for the 2024 general elections in Delhi on Wednesday, Day Two of her visit to the national capital in preparation for the Lok Sabha elections of 2024. "She will lead the battle for 2024 against the BJP. We want to see her as prime minister. All of us told her so," said Trinamul MP Kalyan Banerjee after a meeting held at the New Delhi residence of the party's Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Shekhar Roy. Chatting with reporters after the meeting, Mamata said, "I am not a political astrologer. The leadership issue depends on the situation, structure and system in place. It is not that everybody can take the lead. When the matter is discussed, we can work together." "When Narendra Modi contests the next poll it will be him against the whole country," Mamata said Mamata's idea behind pitching for the 2024 polls from now is to keep up the momentum she has gained from this summer's assembly polls which she won decisively to stop the BJP on its tracks. But she is not the only chief minister to successfully thwart the BJP's regional ambitions. In Pinarayi Vijayan's Kerala, the BJP could not win a single seat. In Tamil Nadu, the MK Stalin- led alliance that includes the Congress and the Left also defeated the BJP. As of now though neither Vijayan nor Stalin have made any national noises. "It is too early to commit on a united front with poll projections from now. This has never been done," said a Congress MP. In fact, during the second term of the UPA when it was becoming clear that the BJP would mount an offensive on the Congress with a concerted campaign, the saffron combine had not rushed in to project a prime ministerial face. It was only in September 2013 did it declare Narendra Modi as its prime ministerial nominee. Trinamul's political fortunes may be on the upswing, but it is unlikely to stay so till 2024. A test of its strength would be in the form of Bengal's civic polls. In some instances like Calcutta Municipal Corporation, elections should have been held in 2020 but got delayed due to the Covid pandemic. But Mamata cannot use the Covid shield to delay the civic polls indefinitely. Memories of the 2018 panchayat polls when Opposition parties were not allowed to file nominations are not yet distant. Mamata felt the backlash in 2019. Local Trinamul leaders have already started threatening Opposition workers against filing nominations for the panchayat polls due two years from now. Having got herself declared as the chairperson of the Trinamul's parliamentary party, Mamata's visits to Delhi are likely to be more frequent in the coming months to keep reinforcing her claim as the most credible face against Modi. Even if she manages to stitch an alliance with the Congress in Bengal, it is unlikely to leave more than two seats for the grand old party. Without spelling out a seat-sharing formula, simply announcing a PM face will not help create an Opposition front. Since the 2019 polls, most of the major Opposition parties have been jointly signing statements against the Modi government. These had signatures of leaders from both the Left and Trinamul.

28-07-2021||India||Antony Blinken: Few relationships in the world as important as that of US-India||In reflection of growing bilateral ties between India and the US, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday held wide-ranging talks covering the situation in Afghanistan, Indo-Pacific engagements, Covid-19 response mechanism and ways to strengthen regional security. At a joint media briefing, Blinken said there are few relationships in the world that are more vital than the one between the US and India. At the same time, he said as the world's leading democracies, "we take seriously our responsibilities" towards freedom, equality and opportunity to all of "our people". He said actions by India and the US shape the 21st century and beyond, and that is why strengthening partnership with India is one of the top foreign policy priorities of the US. "Shared values - freedom and equality - are key and none of us have done enough. We need to strengthen our democratic institutions. This is at the core of our relationship, beyond strategic and economic ties," Blinken was quoted as saying by ndtv.com. "One of the elements Americans admire most is fundamental freedom and human rights. That's how we define India. India's democracy is powered by free-thinking citizens," Blinken said. "Both of our democracies are works in progress... As I said before, sometimes that process is painful. Sometimes it's ugly. But the strength of democracy is to embrace it," the US Secretary of state added. Referring to Afghanistan, Blinken said both India and the US are committed to the proposition that there is no military solution to the conflict in that country, asserting that there has to be a peaceful resolution that requires the Taliban and the Afghan government to come to the negotiating table. "We both agreed strongly that any future government in Afghanistan has to be inclusive and fully representative of the Afghan people... Ultimately it has to be an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process," he said. Blinken said India "has and will" continue to make a vital contribution to Afghanistan's stability and development. On his part, Jaishankar said that the talks took place at an important juncture when key global and regional challenges needed to be effectively addressed. "Our bilateral partnership enhanced to a level that it enables us to deal collaboratively with larger issues," he said. Jaishankar said the issue of the coronavirus pandemic was naturally a particular priority. "We discussed travel challenges resulting from Covid," he said. "We looked at Afghanistan, Indo-Pacific and the Gulf region," he added. On Afghanistan, Jaishankar said that the world wishes to see an independent, sovereign, democratic and stable Afghanistan. Earlier in the Day, Blinken met civil society members and said that both US and India share a commitment to democratic values and it is part of the bedrock of the bilateral relationship. The US Secretary of State said that successful democracies include "thriving" civil societies, noting that they are needed to make democracies "more open, more inclusive, more resilient, more equitable." All people deserve to have a voice in their government and be treated with respect no matter who they are Blinken asserted while noting that Indians and Americans believe in human dignity, equality of opportunity, the rule of law, fundamental freedoms, including freedom of religion and belief. "Perhaps most important, we're connected by shared values, and I believe shared aspirations, that are common to our people. The Indian people and the American people believe in human dignity, in equality of opportunity, the rule of law, fundamental freedoms, including freedom of religion and belief," he said. "We believe that all people deserve to have a voice in their government and be treated with respect no matter who they are. These are fundamental tenets of democracies like ours, and our purpose is to give real meaning to these words and constantly renew our commitment to these ideals," he added. Ahead of his two-day visit, US officials had said Blinken would raise issues related to “human rights and democracy” with India.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-384
28-07-2021||India||Kashmiri Pandits feeling more secure, says Centre||Kashmiri Pandits have been feeling "more secure" and over 3,800 youngsters from the community have moved back to Kashmir recently to take up jobs provided as part of the prime minister's rehabilitation package, the government informed Parliament on Wednesday. Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai said this in a written reply to a question put to his ministry in the Rajya Sabha. He was asked a clutch of questions on Kashmiri Pandits such as whether the government is aware that many of them have become "insecure" in the last few years, the number of Kashmiri Pandit and Dogra Hindu families currently staying in the Kashmir valley and their demands from the government. As per the report of the Relief Office set up in 1990 by the government of Jammu and Kashmir, 44,167 Kashmiri migrant families are registered, who had to move from the valley since 1990 due to security concerns. “Out of these, the count of registered Hindu migrant families is 39,782,” the minister stated. "Kashmiri Pandits have felt more secure in the recent past, as evident from the fact that 3,841 Kashmiri migrants youth have moved back to Kashmir and have taken up jobs in various districts of Kashmir under the Prime Minister's rehabilitation package," he said. Rai added that another 1,997 candidates were selected for jobs under the same package in April and they will be moving to Kashmir soon. It is also pertinent to mention that as many as 26,684 Kashmiri migrant youth showed interest in going back to the valley by applying for the above referred 1,997 posts, which were advertised by the Jammu and Kashmir's recruitment board in December, 2020. “The government has also prepared a comprehensive policy to provide residential accommodation to these Kashmiri migrants who have moved back to Kashmir,” Rai said. He said 6,000 residential units are being constructed for them at an "accelerated pace" and 1,000 residential units are already being used by these employees. The minister also gave the number of these families based in the valley. "Approximately 900 such families, including Kashmiri Pandit and Dogra Hindu families, are residing in Kashmir. "As regards those who never migrated from Kashmir, the government allowed their inclusion in the jobs package for Kashmiri migrants," he said. Besides, they are getting all the benefits of government schemes along with others in Kashmir, Rai added. The government has taken "necessary steps" to protect the life and property of people and these include proactive operations against terrorists, identification and arrest of overground workers or supporters of terrorism, action against members of banned organisations, intensified night patrolling checking at nakas, security arrangements through appropriate deployment, coordination meetings amongst intelligence agencies and maintaining a high level of alertness, he stated.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-385
28-07-2021||India||Delhi HC expresses displeasure over non-compliance of IT Rules by Twitter||The Delhi High Court Wednesday expressed displeasure over Twitter Inc appointing a contingent worker as Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and said the microblogging platform was non-compliant with the new Information Technology (IT) Rules. Justice Rekha Palli noted that while the rules mandated appointment of a key managerial person or a senior employee as CCO, Twitter disclosed in its affidavit that it had appointed a contingent worker through a third party contractor. He (CCO) is categorical (in his affidavit) that he is not an employee. This itself is in the teeth of the rule. There has to be some seriousness about the rule. Some sanctity has to be given, the court remarked. The court added that it had reservations with respect to the usage of the term contingent worker by Twitter especially when it was not known who the third party contractor was. “What is this contingent worker? I don't know what it would mean. I have a problem with the word. Contingent then third party contractor! What is this? I am not happy with the affidavit,” the judge told Twitter. The court said Twitter's affidavit was unacceptable and asked it to comply with the rules whole-heartedly. File a better affidavit. This is not acceptable. I'm giving you a long rope but don't expect the court to do it on and on. Disclose the name of the third party contractor and explain contingent, the court said as it granted a week's time to Twitter to file the new affidavit. The court further directed Twitter to not only disclose all the details pertaining to the appointment of the CCO as well as the Resident Grievance Officer (RGO) but also clarify as to why a Nodal Contact Person had not been appointed yet and by when the position will be filled. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 seek to regulate dissemination and publication of content in cyber space, including social media platforms, and were notified in February by the central government. Pursuant to the last order, Twitter Inc filed an affidavit before court, informing that it has appointed a resident of India as CCO, effective July 6. Senior advocate Sajan Poovayya, representing Twitter, stated that while the CCO was a contingent worker, appointed via third party contractor, he has undertaken to perform all functions and responsibilities under the IT Rules. Usage of the term contingent worker was on account of structure of employment and the fact that Twitter Inc did not have a liaison office in India, Poovayya said as he added that the platform would no longer appoint interim officers to the posts. It was reiterated that the process for establishing a liaison office on ongoing. The person appointed as CCO would also act as the RGO, effective July 7, Poovayya said. In the affidavit, Twitter has stated that while one Vinay Prakash has been appointed to the two positions as contingent worker via third party contractor, it has posted publicly a job announcement for CCO and RGO as direct employee and that it will make endeavour in good faith to make an offer of employment to a qualified candidate who is resident in India to fill this position in 8 weeks . Poovayya further submitted that the Nodal Contact Person was yet to be appointed and sought two weeks from the court for the appointment. I don't know what you want to do. If you want to (comply with the rules), do it whole-heartedly, the judge responded. Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, appearing for the Central government, argued that Twitter was acting in abject non-compliance of the rules as the CCO has to be an employee of the social media intermediary and not a contingent worker. It has been months. You can't have it so easy. We hold our hands because we are before your lordship, ASG Sharma said. Advocate G Tushar Rao, appearing for petitioner-lawyer Amit Acharya, objected to the appointment of the same person as CCO and RGO and said that since the roles were different, the same person could not hold the two positions. Poovayya responded that there was no bar on appointment of the same person as CCO and GRO in the rules. Acharya, in his petition, claimed that he came to know about the alleged non-compliance of IT Rules by Twitter when he tried to lodge a complaint against a couple of tweets. Twice before, on July 6 and July 8, the court had granted time to Twitter to file an affidavit to show compliance with the IT Rules. The Centre had said in its affidavit that Twitter failed to comply with India's new IT Rules, which could lead to its losing immunity conferred under the IT Act. The matter would be heard next on August 6.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-385
28-07-2021||India||Calcutta HC permits Bengal govt to file supplementary affidavit on post-poll violence ||The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday granted the Bengal government time to file supplementary affidavits by July 31 in connection with an NHRC inquiry committee report on alleged post-poll violence in the state. A five-judge bench, presided by Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal, directed that the matter will be taken up for hearing again on August 2. The high court granted the state government time to file the supplementary affidavits following a prayer by it. The DNA report of deceased BJP labour wing leader Avijit Sarkar was also submitted by the additional solicitor general before the bench, which was hearing PILs claiming assault on people, forcing them to flee homes and destruction of property due to violence following the Assembly elections. The court had directed a DNA matching of Sarkar with his brother for identification. A second autopsy had earlier been carried out at the Command Hospital here on an order by the bench. The NHRC committee, set up by its chairman on a direction by the court, had made scathing comments on the law and order situation in Bengal in its final report submitted before it on July 13. The state government, in an affidavit submitted on Monday, denied the findings of the report and alleged that it is politically motivated and aimed at maligning the Mamata Banerjee dispensation. The 95-page affidavit placed by state home secretary B.P. Gopalika described as “sweeping homilies, absurd and false” the report of the NHRC committee, which the chief minister had called “a great liar”. The report, which the BJP has gone to town with since, had named several current and former lawmakers of the Trinamul Congress, including a senior minister, in its list of 123 “notorious criminals/goons”. The state government’s affidavit countered every point and allegation in the report of the eight-member committee to convince the five-judge bench of the high court that the report was biased and based on the false allegations that the state’s BJP leaders had been levelling against the ruling party after their miserable defeat in the Assembly elections. The affidavit tried to prove that at least three on the eight-member committee were well connected with the BJP. The affidavit claimed that the committee did not have the power to make recommendations in its report for the state administration to implement them. In its long list of recommendations, the committee endorsed most of the demands being made so far by the BJP, such as probes by the CBI, trials outside Bengal, a witness protection scheme, ex-gratia payments, compensation for alleged damages, static pickets of central forces, and action against “delinquent” government servants. The affidavit claimed that the so-called recommendations were invalid and illegal, and countered every allegation with references, stating police action already taken with regard to the complaints.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-385
28-07-2021||India||Mamata remains ambivalent on being face of Opposition||Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday remained ambivalent on being the face of the Opposition to take on the BJP, saying it will depend on the situation. "I want to help all the opposition parties to bell the cat. I don't want to be a leader, but a simple cadre," she said on the leadership issue. "I am not a political astrologer. It depends on the situation, structure. I have no problem if someone else leads. When the matter is discussed we can decide. I cannot impose," Banerjee told a select group of reporters here when asked if she would be the face of the Opposition. On the Pegasus row, she said the situation was more serious than Emergency and accused the Centre of being unresponsive. "Everywhere they are sending ED, IT for raids. Here there is no response. In a democracy, the government has to respond. "The situation is very serious, it's more serious than the emergency," the Trinamool Congress chief said. On Tuesday, Banerjee had said the unity of opposition parties will take shape on its own. "I am a simple worker and want to continue as a worker," Banerjee, who is in the national capital for the first time after her party's resounding victory in the assembly polls, said on Wednesday. "I want to see sachcha din, bahut din acha di dekh liya," Banerjee added, in a jibe at the BJP's poll slogan.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-385
28-07-2021||India||Lok Sabha passes Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill without debate||The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the IBC amendment bill without debate, which among other things provide for a pre-packaged resolution process for stressed MSMEs. Minister of State for Corporate Affairs Rao Inderjit Singh moved the Bill for consideration and passage amid the din. The bill was approved by the House without any discussion, as Opposition members continued their protest over Pegasus snooping issue and three new farm laws. Singh said the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill, 2021, will replace the ordinance that was promulgated on April 4 as part of efforts to provide relief to MSMEs adversely impacted by the pandemic. The proposed amendments would enable the government to notify the threshold of a default not exceeding Rs 1 crore for initiation of the pre-packaged resolution process. The government has already prescribed the threshold of Rs 10 lakh for this purpose. The bill proposes a new chapter in the IB Code to facilitate the pre-packaged insolvency resolution process for corporate persons that are Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). As per the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the bill, it seeks to specify a minimum threshold of not more than Rs 1 crore for initiating the pre-packaged insolvency resolution process as well as provisions for disposal of simultaneous applications for initiation of the insolvency resolution process and pre-packaged insolvency resolution process, pending against the same corporate debtor. There would be a penalty for fraudulent or malicious initiation of the pre-packaged insolvency resolution process, or with intent to defraud persons, and for fraudulent management of the corporate debtor during the process. Further, punishment would be meted out for offences related to the pre-packaged insolvency resolution process.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-385

The survey conducted with over 32,000 parents across 361 districts in the country found that 30 per cent parents are willing to send their wards to schools if coronavirus cases in their districts come down to zero. "Vaccinating children in the coming months is going to be key if children are to go to schools for physical classes. Forty-eight per cent of the surveyed parents said they are not willing to send their children to schools till they are vaccinated. “At least 21 per cent of parents said whenever the schools reopen, they are ready to send their wards there,” said the survey by an online platform, Local Circles. Nearly 47 per cent of the respondents of the survey were from tier 1 districts, 27 per cent from tier 2 and 26 per cent respondents were from tier 3, 4 and rural districts. Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya had on Tuesday told BJP MPs that Covid vaccination for children was likely to start soon. Schools across the country were ordered shut in March last year ahead of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the highly contagious infection. While several states started partial reopening of schools in October last year, physical classes were again suspended following the exponential rise in the Covid-19 cases during the second wave. The states that have partially reopened schools this month include Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar. Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have announced reopening of schools in the first week of August.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-385

The searches were carried out in Mumbai, Pune, Ahmednagar, Nashik, Thane, Solapur, Sangli and Osmanabad, they added. The premises of "encounter specialist" Patil in Pune and Mumbai, and those of Bhujbal in Ahmednagar and Mumbai were covered during the operation, which concluded on Tuesday night, the officials said. The other premises belonged to alleged middlemen whose names have not been disclosed by the agency. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked Deshmukh and other unidentified persons under the IPC section related to criminal conspiracy and sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act for "attempting to obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of public duty". In his letter to Maharasthra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray after he was removed from the Mumbai police commissioner's post, Param Bir Singh had alleged that Deshmukh asked Assistant Police Inspector Sachin Waze to extort over Rs 100 crore a month from the bars and restaurants of the city, the officials said. "The preliminary enquiry prima facie revealed that a cognizable offence is made out in the matter, wherein the then home minister of Maharashtra, Anil Deshmukh, and unknown others have attempted to obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of their public duty," the CBI FIR alleges. According to the CBI manual, a preliminary enquiry is initiated to assess if there is enough prima facie material in the allegations to proceed with a regular case for a full-fledged probe, the officials said. The CBI enquiry found that Waze was reinstated into the police force after being out of service for more than 15 years. Waze was entrusted with most of the sensational and important cases of the Mumbai City Police and Deshmukh, the then Maharashtra home minister, was aware of it, the FIR alleges. It further alleges that Deshmukh "and others" exercised undue influence over the transfer and posting of officials, thereby exercising undue influence over the performance of their official duties.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-385

Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai stated this in a written reply to Rajya Sabha. He was replying to a question on whether the government had any proposal to "reinstate" the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir and whether some efforts have been made to end the year-long ban on different means of communication. "Statehood to Jammu and Kashmir would be granted at an appropriate time after normalcy is restored in Jammu and Kashmir," he said. "In view of the constitutional changes and bifurcation of the erstwhile state of the Jammu and Kashmir into Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Union territory of Ladakh, in national interest and also in the interest of security of J&K, temporary restrictions on various communication channels like internet and mobile services were resorted to in Jammu and Kashmir," the minister stated. Subsequently, the matter "was reviewed from time to time and restrictions imposed were gradually eased out in a phased manner and 4G internet data services were restored in the entire Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir from February 5, he said. The Centre had revoked the special status of the erstwhile state that was provided to it under Article 370 and bifurcated it into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh in 2019.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-385

He rejected the government's charges over the disruption of Parliament and said the Opposition was only fulfilling its responsibility. He also attacked the government over the Pegasus snooping row, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit of "hitting the soul of India's democracy". The voice of Opposition was being suppressed in Parliament, he alleged. "We are only asking if the government bought Pegasus and snooped upon Indians." "I want to ask the people - there is a weapon Narendra Modi has planted in your phones... used against opposition leaders, journalists, activists... should there not be a discussion in Parliament," he stressed "... if we (the Opposition) agree there will be no discussion on Pegasus... the issue will get buried... till the time Pegasus is not discussed in Parliament, we are going nowhere," the Congress leader, whose name was on the potential target list, said. "We are not disturbing Parliament, we are only fulfilling our responsibility," he said. He also said the Pegasus row "for us is an issue of nationalism, treason". "This is not a matter of privacy. It is an anti-national work." He said the Opposition was united over the issue. Earlier in the day, Opposition parties met in Parliament to discuss the issue. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, who was part of that meeting, said the parties were "united in our stand to protect issues of national security, democracy and farmers' welfare." "Like Rahulji explained, the government has used this weapon as an arrow again democracy and we will not stand for it. This must be discussed in Parliament," he was quoted as saying by ndtv.com. The government has been rejecting all Opposition charges over the issue. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday singled out the Opposition Congress and accused the party of blocking Parliament. Modi singled out the Congress and attacked it despite the fact that other Opposition parties like the DMK, Trinamul Congress and the Left were also protesting and stalling Parliament. “Modiji said that the Congress was not only blocking Parliament but it was also not allowing efforts to resolve the deadlock succeed,” said one BJP MP, who attended the closed-door meeting. “He asked us to expose the Congress before the people and the media.” The government has been trying to show that it was ready for discussions on all issues but it was the Opposition, particularly the Congress, which was bent on only obstructing Parliament proceedings. The monsoon session of Parliament commenced on July 19, a day after the Pegasus hacking row broke out, and is scheduled to continue till Aug 13.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-385
28-07-2021||India||Everyone deserves to have a voice no matter who they are, says Antony Blinken||All people deserve to have a voice in their government and be treated with respect no matter who they are, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken asserted on Wednesday while noting that Indians and Americans believe in human dignity, equality of opportunity, the rule of law, fundamental freedoms, including freedom of religion and belief. Addressing civil society members in his first public event after arriving here and ahead of his meetings with the Indian leadership, Blinken said that both US and India share a commitment to democratic values and it is part of the bedrock of the bilateral relationship. The US Secretary of State said that successful democracies include "thriving" civil societies, noting that they are needed to make democracies "more open, more inclusive, more resilient, more equitable." Blinken cited business cooperation, educational engagement, religious and spiritual ties and ties between millions of families as some of the key pillars of the overall relationship. "Perhaps most important, we're connected by shared values, and I believe shared aspirations, that are common to our people. The Indian people and the American people believe in human dignity, in equality of opportunity, the rule of law, fundamental freedoms, including freedom of religion and belief," he said. "We believe that all people deserve to have a voice in their government and be treated with respect no matter who they are. These are fundamental tenets of democracies like ours, and our purpose is to give real meaning to these words and constantly renew our commitment to these ideals," he added. The transcript of his address was released by the US State department. In the course of his remarks, Blinken referred to rising global threats to democracy and international freedoms, talked about "democratic recession", noting that it is vital for India and the US to continue to stand together in support of these ideals. "When you put it all together, the relationship between our countries is one of the most important in the world. And I think that's because not only is it a relationship between governments when we're working between our governments, but critically it's through relationships between the Indian and the American people," he said. "And of course, both of our democracies are works in progress. As friends, we talk about that, because doing the hard work of strengthening democracy and making our ideals real is often challenging. "We know that firsthand in the United States, where we aspire to be, in the words of our founders, a more perfect union. That's an acknowledgement from day one of our country that in a sense we will always fall short of the mark, but that the way to make progress is by constantly trying to achieve those ideals," he said. Sometimes that process is "painful, sometimes it's ugly", but the strength of democracy is to embrace it, Blinken added "At the same time, we celebrate our achievements. Here in India, that includes the free media, independent courts, a vibrant and free and fair electoral system -- the largest expression of free political will by citizens anywhere in the world," he said. "At a time of rising global threats to democracy and international freedoms - we talk about a democratic recession -- it's vital that we two world leading democracies continue to stand together in support of these ideals," he noted. Blinken said he is in India to underscore the importance of the relationships and to try to deepen the ties and extend the cooperation. "I think it's hard to find countries with more -- who do more together in more different areas than with the United States and India," he said. Later he in a tweet, he said,"I was pleased to meet civil society leaders today. The U.S. and India share a commitment to democratic values; this is part of the bedrock of our relationship and reflective of India's pluralistic society and history of harmony. Civil society helps advance these values." Ahead of his visit, the Indian side had indicated that it is prepared to engage with the US on issues relating to human rights and democracy after a senior Biden administration official said that Blinken will raise these matters with Indian leaders. US acting assistant secretary for South and Central Asian affairs Dean Thompson said on Friday that Blinken will raise issues of human rights and democracy with Indian officials during the visit. Following the comments, government sources said India is proud of its achievements in upholding democratic values and human rights and it is open to engaging with those who recognise diversity.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-386
28-07-2021||India||SC dismisses Kerala govt's plea to withdraw case against LDF MLAs||The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea by the Kerala government for withdrawal of a criminal case against some LDF MLAs in connection with a ruckus in the state Assembly in 2015, saying allowing prosecution to be withdrawn would amount to interference in normal course of justice for illegitimate reasons . The apex court said acts of destruction of public property cannot be equated with either the freedom of speech of the legislator or with forms of protest legitimately available to the members of the Opposition. "Privileges and immunities are not gateway to claim exemption from the general law of the land, particularly as in this case the criminal law which governs the action of every citizen," a bench of justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said. The bench dismissed the appeals, including the one filed by the state against the March 12 order of the Kerala High Court which had dismissed the plea seeking withdrawal of criminal case lodged against some LDF MLAs in the matter. The state Assembly had witnessed unprecedented scenes on March 13, 2015 as LDF members, then in Opposition, tried to prevent the then finance minister K M Mani, who was facing allegations in the bar bribery scam, from presenting the state Budget. Besides flinging the Speaker's chair from the podium, electronic equipment like computers, keyboards and mikes on the desk of the presiding officer were also allegedly damaged by the then LDF members. While pronouncing the verdict, Justice Chandrachud said the purpose of bestowing privileges and immunity to the elected members of the legislature is to enable them to perform their functions without hindrance, fear or favour. "We miss the wood for the trees if we focus on rights without the corresponding duties cast upon elected public representatives", the bench said. "It also observed that public prosecutor is duty-bound to act independently. "To allow the prosecution to be withdrawn in the face of these allegations, in respect of which, upon investigation, a final report has been submitted under section 173 of the CrPC and cognisance has been taken, would amount to an interference in the normal course of justice for illegitimate reasons", it said. The bench said allowing the prosecution to be withdrawn would only result in a singular result that elected representatives are exempt from the mandate of criminal law. The apex court had reserved its verdict on the pleas on July 15. The counsel appearing for the state government had argued that the incident happened in 2015 when there were allegations of corruption against the state government and the finance minister was about to table the budget in the House. The counsel had said the FIR lodged by the secretary of Legislative Assembly did not have any constitutional backing as the Speaker had not given any sanction and to give quietus to the matter, the present government has moved an application for withdrawal of the prosecution. He had argued that the act of the House members was covered under Legislative Privileges and the authority to take action against them vests with the Speaker, not the Legislative Secretary. The lawyer representing some of the accused had said there is new government in place now and if the public prosecutor feels that it was a political issue, then it can be a ground for withdrawal. The case, which also involves V Sivankutty who is a minister in the state, was registered against a group of the then LDF MLAs. In its plea filed in the apex court against the high court order, the Kerala government had claimed that the high court had failed to appreciate that the alleged incident had occurred while the Assembly was in session and no crime could have been registered "without previous sanction" of the Speaker. The state government had moved the high court against an order of the trial court which had dismissed an application filed by the public prosecutor seeking permission to withdraw from prosecution against the accused in the case. The case was registered for the alleged offences under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including 447 (criminal trespass), and under the provision of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-386

"A broad-based, multi-sectoral, global comprehensive strategic partnership. EAM @DrSJaishankar welcomes US Secretary of State @SecBlinken," external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi tweeted along with a photograph of the two leaders. Before meeting Jaishankar, Blinken held talks with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on a range of bilateral and regional issues including the security situation in Afghanistan. Earlier, Blinken met civil society leaders after which he said the US and India share a commitment to democratic values and it is part of the bedrock of the relationship. "I was pleased to meet civil society leaders today. The US and India share a commitment to democratic values; this is part of the bedrock of our relationship and reflective of India's pluralistic society and history of harmony. Civil society helps advance these values," he tweeted. It is Blinken's first visit to India after assuming charge as the US Secretary of State and the third by a high-ranking Biden administration official after it came to power in January. As Blinken arrived in New Delhi on Tuesday evening, the US State Department said the US supports India's emergence as a leading global power and vital partner in efforts to ensure that the Indo-Pacific is a region of peace, stability, and growing prosperity and economic inclusion. "India is a leading global power and a key U.S. partner in the Indo-Pacific and beyond," it said in a fact sheet on ties between the two countries. People familiar with the agenda of the meeting between Blinken and Jaishankar said that a plethora of pressing issues such as the fluid situation in Afghanistan, regional security concerns, COVID-19 response and boosting Indo-Pacific engagement will figure in the deliberations. Afghanistan witnessed a series of terror attacks in the last few weeks as the US withdrew the majority of its troops and is looking at completing the drawdown by August 31, ending nearly two-decade of its military presence in the country. In the talks, the Indian side is expected to raise the implications of the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and the need for sustained pressure on Pakistan on terror financing and terrorist safe havens. India and the US are also likely to focus on ways to augment trade and investment ties besides looking at opportunities in healthcare, education, digital domains in the talks.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-386

The 61-year-old leader was administered the oath of office and secrecy by Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot at the Raj Bhavan here. Ending the heightened suspense, the Karnataka BJP legislature party on Tuesday evening had elected Basavaraj Bommai as its new leader to succeed outgoing Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa.

28-07-2021||India||At least 5 killed in Jammu and Kashmir cloudburst, over 25 missing||Five bodies were recovered on Wednesday after some houses were swept away by flash floods triggered by a cloudburst in a remote village in Kishtwar district of Jammu and Kashmir, a senior official said. Over 25 people are reported missing in the cloudburst which struck Honzar village in Dacchan tehsil around 4.30 am, officials said, adding a joint rescue operation by police, army and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) is underway. Bodies of five persons were recovered from the cloudburst- hit village by the rescuers so far, District Development Commissioner, Kishtwar, Ashok Kumar Sharma, told PTI. He said a total of six houses were swept away by the flash floods triggered by the cloudburst and a search and rescue operation was on when last reports were received. Director General of Police-cum-Commandant General Home Guard, Civil Defence and SDRF, V K Singh, said two women are among the five persons killed in the cloudburst, while over 25 others are still missing. One of our SDRF teams from Kishtwar reached the affected village and two more teams are on their way from Doda and Udhampur districts. Two more SDRF teams are waiting for weather to improve to get airlifted from Jammu and Srinagar to the scene and join the rescue mission, Singh said. He said six houses and a ration store were damaged by the cloudburst. The district development commissioner, Kishtwar, said two more cloudbursts struck remote Lambard area overnight but there was no report of any loss of life. There is some damage to infrastructure but exact details are awaited, Sharma said. He said 60 families were evacuated to safety from the Paddar area in view of incessant rains which posed a threat to their homes. Most parts of the Jammu region have been receiving heavy rains for the past few days. With the prediction of more rains till July-end, authorities in Kishtwar have already asked people living along water bodies and slide-prone areas to remain vigilant. "The meteorological department has predicted heavy rains during the upcoming days and water levels in rivers and drains are expected to rise, which can pose a threat to the inhabitants residing near rivers, drains, water bodies and slide-prone areas," the district administration said in an advisory issued late on Tuesday night.Jamm||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-386
28-07-2021||India||18 killed in Uttar Pradesh as speeding truck rams into bus||At least 18 people were killed and 25 injured after a truck rammed into a stationary double-decker bus here, police said on Wednesday. The accident took place on the Lucknow-Ayodhya highway under Kotwali Ramsanehighat area late on Tuesday night. The private bus was carrying over 130 passengers to Bihar from Ludhiana in Punjab, they said. The axle of the bus broke down and it was parked on the road when a speeding truck coming from behind hit it, killing 18 people on the spot and injuring 25 others, the police said. Some passengers were standing or resting outside the bus while others were sitting inside while waiting for the axel to be repaired when the incident took place, they said. The victims, mostly labourers from Bihar, were returning home after sowing paddy in Punjab and Haryana, the police said. Police rushed to the spot after receiving information about the accident and the rescue operation was carried out with the help of locals. The injured were rushed to a local hospital and from there eight people, who were seriously injured, were referred to the trauma centre in Lucknow, Additional Director General of Police, Lucknow Zone, S N Sabat said. It was raining heavily when the accident took place and this posed some problems in the rescue operation, he said. Additional Chief Secretary, Home, Awanish Awasthi in Lucknow said Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath about the accident and extended his condolences to the families of the deceased. The CM has also expressed his condolences and directed the district magistrate and the superintendent of police of Barabanki to provide the best medical care to the injured and make proper arrangements for taking other passengers of the bus to their destinations, Awasthi said. Modi has also announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh each from the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund for the families of the deceased. The injured would be given Rs 50,000 each.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-386
28-07-2021||India||Organ trafficking concern about Assam and Calcutta||Just as India and its health system limp back to a semblance of normality after the devastation of Covid, an old scandal has resurfaced. India has been one of the global epicentres of trafficking in organs. It is distinguished by the regularity with which it hits national headlines, provokes transient outrage, receives promises of action but comes back again. Given the misery of those suffering from end-stage organ failure, the hopelessness of India’s poor making them susceptible to being allured by promise of quick money and the willingness of a section of healthcare professionals to look away, the organ bazaar refuses to die down. Worryingly, the Covid-19 pandemic seems to have added fuel to the fire. The latest playground of this saga is Assam and Calcutta. In the last few days, paid kidney donors and brokers who facilitate contact with willing recipients and hospitals have been arrested from multiple districts of Assam. Newspaper reports indicate that most of them are informal labourers who are in severe debt due to loss of livelihood as a result of Covid. Left with no recourse to make ends meet, they decided to sell their organs. As happens often in these transactions, they were promised large sums of money but received lesser amounts from the broker, which provoked them to blow the whistle. The alleged destination for these kidneys were certain hospitals in Calcutta. While a latecomer to the lucrative business of paid organ transplantation, going by news reports Calcutta seems to have emerged as a hotspot in recent times. At a time when transplants in the rest of India had largely stopped during Covid, some Calcutta hospitals seems to have continued their business unabated. The history of commercial organ transplants in India is rather long and sordid. The Human Organ Transplant Act (THOA) of 1994 partially succeeded in curbing the then rampant kidney selling that thrived in the 70s and 80s. THOA has a comprehensive system of checks and balances that can curb any form of trading. But the system is gamed by complicit players. Given its large numbers of the poor, India remains fertile ground for organ selling. The brokers skilfully tutor donors and help with fudging papers to show they are close relatives of the recipient, which then passes off for a legitimate transplant. Given its complex nature, transplantation needs a large team of trained doctors and support staff. The medical team has close interaction with the donor during the process of evaluation to ascertain fitness to undergo surgery, after which an independent authorisation committee evaluates the altruistic nature of the donation. Whether a donor lured into donating purely by offer of money or coercion and posing as a relative can hoodwink an experienced hospital authorisation committee as well as the medical team is arguable. When this happens regularly in certain hospitals, it indicates a certain permissiveness and even collusion which is driven by the revenue that transplants generate in the private sector. If the healthcare profession refuses to collude, organ selling will come to a halt. Transplantation in India is largely a private sector activity and a significant source of income for hospitals. It is also a big component of “medical tourism” that corporate hospitals like to project as a mark of quality. Some hospitals are known for large volumes of “international” transplants. This is stark in liver transplantation where estimates show that around 20 per cent of transplants are performed on foreigners. Whilst medical tourism brings in foreign exchange and is a recognition of expertise, it poses unique challenges in transplantation. It is believed that a significant number of those who travel for transplants across borders involve some form of unrelated paid donation. Whilst it would be laudable to share expertise with underserved countries, the current model is just a commercial service to the well off from abroad who can travel to India. It is paradoxical that in a country where tens of thousands of our citizens needing lifesaving transplants can’t get them, foreigners with funds can travel and avail themselves of the expertise of those who train in India’s public medical colleges and hospitals. Like in the rest of the world, Covid severely affected the numbers of transplants in India. It also reduced the number of deceased organ donations, which were substantial in some pockets of the country. This means that those waiting for organs are now in an even more desperate situation. On the other hand it is also an opportune time for luring our poor and vulnerable citizens to sell organs. This is an explosive situation. A similar spurt in organ selling by a desperate affected population was noted following the Nepal earthquake of 2015. The Northeast is relatively underserved in health care. Its citizens have traditionally travelled to other parts of India, including Calcutta, for advanced healthcare needs. It is tragic that now its population is being targeted as a source of organs. Poor people from these states and Bangladesh have emerged as a source for human trafficking in many forms, including for organs. It will be important to watch how seriously the current scandal is investigated. There are several regulatory mechanisms to punish the guilty. But we have been there before. Donors, brokers and even recipients are criminalised and jailed whereas the accused healthcare staff and institutions get away either scot-free or with a light slap on the wrist. But what is also critical is the response of transplant professionals and their organisations. Most of them have endorsed the WHO Guiding Principles and the Declaration of Istanbul — a global policy statement against trafficking and commerce in transplantation. They can play a key role by publicly censuring their colleagues. Peer pressure and shaming can make an impact that no law can. On its part, Bengal can act to reign in these transplant centres that seem to be crossing the line with a certain impunity. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has a reputation of taking firm steps to regulate the health sector. This is an opportunity for her once again to demonstrate her commitment to protect the vulnerable. Covid has taught us many lessons. One of them is the need for restoring the primacy of science and ethics in health care to win people’s trust. This is also true of transplantation, which in its legitimate form involves amazing acts of altruism and human solidarity by ordinary citizens. As members of India’s transplantation community we urge our colleagues to remember this. Sanjay Nagral is a liver surgeon from Mumbai and co-chair of the Declaration of Istanbul Custodian Group. Vivekanand Jha is a nephrologist, member of the WHO Task Force for Donation and Transplantation and past president of the International Society of Nephrology. Noble Gracious is a nephrologist from Thiruvananthapuram and nodal officer for the organ transplant programme, government of Kerala.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-386
28-07-2021||India||Covid: SC seeks Centre's response on orphan data discrepancy||The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought an explanation from the Centre on the glaring discrepancy between the figures furnished by the Union government and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) on the children orphaned in the country because of the coronavirus pandemic. A bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose told additional solicitor-general Aishwarya Bhati that while the reply filed by the Centre said it has extended financial and rehabilitation assistance to support 645 orphaned children, the data submitted by the NCPCR said 6,855 kids lost their parents from March 2020 to July 2021. Bhati sought time to take instructions from the government on the vast variation in the figures submitted by the Centre and the statutory commission. The court was dealing suo motu on the conditions of children in remand homes because of the pandemic. The bench clarified that its earlier directive in May for providing necessary succour and rehabilitation to orphaned children was not confined to those who lost their parents because of Covid but included those orphaned because of other reasons. Justice Rao pointed out that the PM-CARES Fund provided Rs 10 lakh to each child orphaned during the Covid pandemic to be used till he or she turned 23 but the scheme covered only a few children. Such welfare measures should cover even other children orphaned because of circumstances not relating to Covid, the bench said. “We cannot restrict the orders passed only to orphans who lost both parents to Covid-19,” Justice Rao said. When Bhati said the PM-CARES Fund covers only those children who lost both their parents to the pandemic, the bench clarified that it was not asking the government to extend the relief under the scheme to other orphans. Instead, the court said, it wanted the government to explore the possibility of extending benefits to such orphans from other schemes meant for children. “We want to clarify that we are not on PM-CARES Fund today. You can take instructions but we are clarifying we are not asking you to extend. You can explore the other schemes you have. Please see those are implemented,” the bench said. The bench noted that many schemes were only on paper and were not being implemented for the benefit of children. “We have constantly been speaking about implementation of the schemes. There is announcement of the scheme but it has to reach the children. We have child welfare centres, district child protection officers, but looking at these numbers, they might need some assistance,” the bench said. Justice Rao said the court was of the view that if the kids were produced before the respective district child welfare committees, at least their immediate needs could be taken care of. The court said there had been instances where many kids sent back home to decongest the child care centres had desperately been calling the officials to say that they have nothing to eat and want to come back. On June 8, the top court had directed the Centre, states and Union Territories to take “stringent action” against those resorting to illegal adoption of children orphaned or abandoned on account of Covid. The bench had passed the directives after being informed by advocate Shobha Gupta appearing for an NGO that a large number of children are being illegally adopted by various other NGOs and individuals.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-386
28-07-2021||India||Seven arrested for child trafficking in Odisha||Odisha police have arrested two men and five women from steel city Rourkela for allegedly being involved in a child trafficking racket. However, the police said the prime accused in the case was on the run. Rourkela additional superintendent of police B.K. Bhoi told The Telegraph: “We had got a complaint about the activities of a group which lured poor parents to sell their children. The gang sold babies to childless couples in Ranchi in Jharkhand and Raigarh in Chhattisgarh. We laid a trap and the people involved in the racket were arrested. All of them were sent to jail. However, another accused is yet to be arrested.” According to the police, all those arrested on Monday are from well-to-do families with business backgrounds. “They also run marriage bureaus and organise marriages. Seeing the desperation of the childless couples, they also look for opportunities to sell them children,” said Bhoi. The police have found photographs of several newborns on the mobile phones of the arrested accused. “Investigation is on. We are yet to trace the children who have been sold,” said Bhoi. The gang used to sell male babies for Rs 3 lakh each and female babies for Rs 1.5 lakh, police said. Sources said police have rescued a one-and-a-half-year-old baby from the gang. The accused have been identified as Seema Agrawal, 45, Sarita Agrawal, 50, Neeta Agrawal, 44, Nikhil Agrawal, 25, Asha Devi, 38, Sheela Agrawal, 28, and Sumit Agarwal, 21. The prime accused Sangeeta Agrawal is absconding. According to the complaint lodged with police, Sangeeta and Neeta had contacted one Seema Khuntia, 50, and lured her to hand over her 18-month-old granddaughter and promised payment of Rs 40,000. On July 23, Khuntia was asked to come near the Idgah field in Rourkela with the baby. According to the deal, the woman reached the appointed place with her granddaughter in the evening. However, Sangeeta and Neeta did not turn up for the meeting and sent Sarita and Seema to take the child instead. Problem cropped up when Khuntia demanded the money at the spot while handing over the child. Sangeeta and Neeta asked her to come to the Janata Niwas Lane in the town to collect the promised amount. But when Khuntia reached the place she did not find any one there. Later she approached the police for help and the child sale racket was busted.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-387
28-07-2021||India||SC issues notice to Centre on a plea seeking uniform healthcare||The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued notices to the Centre, states and the Union Territories on a plea seeking fixing of rates for each type of medical treatment and service offered by private hospitals, which account for over 70 per cent of the country’s healthcare system, so that patients are not charged arbitrarily. According to the PIL, there is no uniform or standard rate of treatment in private hospitals despite a 2010 law under which rules were framed in 2012 stipulating mandatory standards and rules to be followed before grant of renewal of licences to the private hospitals. The petitioners wanted the court to direct the Centre and the states to fix the maximum permissible rates private hospitals and clinics can charge. A bench of Justices N.V. Ramana and Surya Kant asked senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, appearing for the petitioners, to serve a copy of the PIL on the authorities concerned so that the court can examine the issue at length. The petition was filed jointly by the NGOs Jan Swasthya Abhiyan and Patients’ Rights Campaign, and social activist K.M. Gopakumar. The petitioners have relied on the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010, the Clinical Establishment (Central Government) Rules, 2012, and the Patients’ Rights Charter, which apply to the regulation of both public and private medical facilities, but are not being implemented. The rules mandate fixation of rates for each type of procedure and service within the range of charges determined by the central government from time to time in consultation with the state governments; minimum standards of facilities and services; minimum requirement of personnel, provisions of maintenance of records and reporting by hospitals before being granted permission to start their services. The conditions that every establishment shall fulfil are: ⚫ Every clinical establishment shall display the rates charged for each type of service provided and facilities available, for the benefit of the patients at a conspicuous place in the local as well as in English language; ⚫ The clinical establishments shall charge the rates for each type of procedures and services within the range of rates determined and issued by the central government from time to time, in consultation with the state governments; ⚫ The clinical establishments shall ensure compliance of the standard treatment guidelines as may be determined and issued by the central government or the state government as the case may be, from time to time. ⚫ The clinical establishments shall maintain and provide electronic media records or electronic health records of every patient as may be determined and issued by the central government or the state government as the case may be, from time to time; ⚫ Every clinical establishment shall maintain information and statistics in accordance with all other applicable laws for the time being in force and the rules made thereunder. The petition has referred to the inadequacies that exist in the public healthcare system, such as lack of sufficient infrastructure and human resources, non-availability of medicines, inadequate public investment and forced dependency on the private sector. It said that on account of lack of proper regulations and implementation of the statutory provisions, there was rampant exploitation of the patients by private hospitals by fixing unaffordable and arbitrary rates for different types of treatments and medical care.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-387
28-07-2021||India||Pegasus: BJP members walk out of meeting of parliamentary panel ||BJP members on Tuesday walked out of a meeting of the parliamentary panel on information technology, protesting against its chairman Shashi Tharoor’s decision to take up the Pegasus snooping controversy a day later, betraying the ruling party’s jitters on the issue. The parliamentary standing committee on information technology, headed by former Union minister and Congress leader Tharoor, is scheduled to discuss “Citizens’ data security and privacy” on Wednesday and the move by BJP members on Tuesday was to scuttle the effort to take up the Pegasus spyware row. On Tuesday, the Tharoor-headed panel was meeting on a different agenda, to hear the views of individuals and organisations on the functioning of the Central Board of Film Certification, in the context of the draft Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill, 2021. The BJP members walked out of the meeting on the Parliament premises, said they had boycotted it and headed to meet Speaker Om Birla. “The agenda of (Wednesday’s) meeting was not shared with us. Also it’s not proper for the committee to hold a meeting when Parliament is in session,” BJP MP Nishikant Dubey told reporters. “Now we are going to meet the Speaker to lodge our protest,” Dubey added, accusing Tharoor of running a “personal agenda”. The BJP has a majority in the 32-member panel. Tharoor had earlier said the Pegasus snooping row would be taken up for discussion as it was the “most important issue for most members”. The parliamentary panel has the powers to summon government officials concerned and question them. The BJP members seemed to be wary of this. “As per rules confidentiality should be maintained. Agenda became public before the meeting. Agenda should be fixed with the consent of members,” said Zafar Islam, another BJP MP on the panel. The agenda of meeting, however, was declared in a communiqué by the Lok Sabha secretariat. It’s not the agenda but what’s discussed inside the meeting that has to be confidential, according to the rules. The protest highlighted the BJP’s unease over any discussion on the Pegasus scandal. The government has been evading the issue since an international media consortium reported that over 300 verified phone numbers, including those of Indian journalists, a former election commissioner, activists, Opposition leaders, ministers, businessmen and ordinary citizens, could have been subjected to surveillance using the Israeli firm NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. Let alone order a probe, as the Opposition has demanded, the government has not even discussed the issue in Parliament so far.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-387
28-07-2021||India||Centre denies plans of increasing days of work under NREGA scheme||Kaushalya Hembram of Jharkhand has no work these days other than collecting firewood from the jungle to support herself and her elderly mother. Last month, Hembram, a resident of Podhaat village under Sonua block in West Singhbhum district, had got 10 days’ work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), which provides up to 100 days’ of unskilled work to every rural household a year. She had been eagerly waiting for work at the project to lay an earthen road from Jhingamarcha to Gotusahi. However, the project was stalled after complaints that a section of the local panchayat was using a JCB machine instead of hiring labourers. The alleged plan was to usurp the wages meant for labourers by falsely showing that they had been engaged. JCB machines are not allowed under the NREGA. “The MGNREGA is the only source of livelihood for me. Otherwise my earnings get reduced to Rs 50 a day by selling firewood and other forest produce. The permissible days of work under the MGNREGA should be increased to 200 per year and every family should be gainfully employed under it,” Hembram said. Under the MGNREGA, a job card holder has to approach the local gram panchayat, which will provide work within 15 days. The worker will receive unemployment allowance for the period that he or she does not receive work after the expiry of the deadline. A worker is to be paid wage within 15 days of completion of the first phase of work.Because of the pandemic and the economic slowdown, usual private work like construction of houses has come down drastically. Other alternative sources of income have also dried up with farmers preferring to do all the agricultural work themselves rather than engaging labourers to save during the hard times. “Last year, I got work for all 100 days under the MGNREGA. Had more work been allowed, I would have taken that up,” Hembram said. Economists and social activists have written to the central government to amend the law to provide for additional 50 to 100 days of work per family in a year. Such a step will ensure that people get to earn more, thereby stabilising consumption demand that has taken a beating due to Covid and the economic mess. However, the government does not appear keen. On Tuesday, Lok Sabha MP S. Venkatesan of the CPM asked in the House whether the Centre planned to increase the days of work under the MGNREGA. Minister of state for rural development Niranjan Jyoti replied in the negative but said the states were free to provide additional days of work from their own budget. “The Mahatma Gandhi NREGA Act, 2005, is to provide at least 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult member volunteers to do unskilled manual work. The states can provide additional man-days of work over and above the 100 days (of labour) from their own resources,” Jyoti said. “An additional 50 days of wage employment is provided over and above 100 days in notified drought-affected areas or areas affected by natural calamities on the recommendation of the ministry of agriculture and farmers’ welfare. At present, there is no plan to increase days of work under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA,” she added. Work provided under the national rural job scheme has witnessed an increase in the current financial year, the minister said. During 2020-21, more than 389.23 crore person-days of work had been generated. Till July 23 of the current financial year (from April 1), more than 130.9 crore person-days have already been generated, Jyoti said in reply to another question. The NREGA Sangharsh Morcha, a civil society group, had last month demanded additional 50 days of work per person under the rural job scheme.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-387
28-07-2021||India||Basavaraj Bommai picked as Karnataka CM, to take oath today||B.S. Yediyurappa loyalist Basavaraj Bommai was on Tuesday picked as Karnataka chief minister, with the BJP appearing to have placated both the outgoing veteran and his influential Lingayat community. The choice of Bommai, 61, seemed to have been driven by a compulsion not to miff the former chief minister and his powerful community that has been the BJP’s key support base for two decades and make up a fifth of Karnataka’s population. Yediyurappa proposed Bommai’s name as the leader of the legislature party at a meeting overseen by Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and G. Kishan Reddy, paving the way for Bommai to take charge as chief minister. Bommai later told reporters that the governor had invited him to form the government. “The governor has invited me to form the government and I alone will take the oath of office at 11am tomorrow (Wednesday),” he told reporters outside the Raj Bhavan about taking over as the 32nd chief minister of Karnataka. “I will work under the guidance of my predecessor Yediyurappa for a pro-people government,” Bommai added. “Because Yediyurappa volunteered to resign, the party has bestowed that responsibility on me. I want to assure the people of Karnataka that mine will be a pro-poor and pro-people government that will deliver justice to all sections of the society,” he said. The arduous task of picking his council of ministers by overcoming pulls and pressures from aspirants — both BJP old-timers and new entrants from the Congress and the Janata Dal Secular who helped topple the alliance government in 2019 and bring the BJP back to power — now awaits him. He is the son of former chief minister S.R. Bommai who had helmed the Janata Party government for eight months from August 1998 to April 1989. H.D. Deve Gowda and H.D. Kumaraswamy were the first father-son duo to head the Karnataka government. While at least half a dozen names had been doing the rounds to replace Yediyurappa who resigned on Monday, the BJP’s central observers announced the successor at the legislature party meeting held at a Bangalore hotel on Tuesday evening. The selection of Bommai is seen as a victory of sorts for Yediyurappa who prevailed upon the party to go for his loyalist. Hundreds of Lingayat pontiffs had also warned the BJP against inviting the community’s wrath by not opting for a chief minister from the community. Yediyurappa, who had made the tearful announcement of quitting of his own volition on Monday two years into his stint, arrived at the meeting venue flashing the victory sign in a clear indication that his nominee Bommai would be the pick. An engineering graduate, Bommai Jr was also part of the Janata parivar but left the Janata Dal United in 2008 to join the BJP. He has since been a close confidante of Yediyurappa and held the law and parliamentary affairs portfolio in the council of ministers dissolved on Monday. A native of Dharwad, Bommai represents the Shiggaon Assembly constituency in Haveri district in north Karnataka, which is part of the Lingayat belt. A three-time MLA, Bommai had also been elected to the Legislative Council for two terms. Bommai promised to take everyone along without any considerations. “I will take everyone along and work together for the people,” he told reporters. “I had never expected this although I had a belief in my heart,” he said when asked if he had any inkling about being named the chief minister. Bommai drove to the Raj Bhavan at night to meet governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot to fulfil the formality of staking claim to form the next government. Yediyurappa and state BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel were among those who accompanied the chief minister-elect.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-387
28-07-2021||India||Mamata focuses on governance issues at interaction with Modi||Mamata Banerjee said in the capital on Tuesday that the Prime Minister should convene an all-party meeting on Pegasus and decide on some sort of a Supreme Court-led probe after taking opinion of all the parties. The Bengal chief minister rolled out the demand within an hour of her meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his 7 Lok Kalyan Marg residence. “On the issue of Pegasus, I think that the Prime Minister should convene a meeting of all political parties, seek their opinion and decide on some sort of an inquiry by the Supreme Court,” Mamata told reporters after the 35-minute meeting with Modi. Asked whether she had placed the same demand before Modi during the meeting, Mamata told The Telegraph later that she had not. During the news conference, Mamata took care to explain that her call-on at the Prime Minister’s residence was a matter of “courtesy” and “protocol” after becoming the chief minister for the third time in a row. During the meeting, she requested Modi to ensure higher supplies of vaccines for the state and faster implementation of the state’s demand for changing the name of West Bengal to Bengal. Some projects related to Bengal were also discussed, Mamata added. “We want all the states to get vaccines and medicines to fight Covid.… But my point is we have got less if you take the state’s population into account. So, we want more vaccines before the third wave,” said Mamata, explaining the broad contours of her discussion with Modi on vaccines. Unlike in the past, she did not accuse the Centre of mishandling the pandemic or favouring the BJP-ruled states while allotting vaccines. Nor did she highlight how Delhi was depriving Bengal by not releasing funds that the Centre owes on account of GST compensation and relief for Cyclone Yaas. The delay in holding bypolls — Mamata needs to win one by November 5 to continue as chief minister — was also not linked to the BJP government. Mamata said the Covid situation was under control for the Assembly bypolls and local elections. Mamata gave the impression that as chief minister, she focused on governance issues during the interaction with the Prime Minister, and the mood at the meeting between her and Modi, who fought a bitter battle during the Bengal Assembly polls a few months ago, was cordial. Later, she told this correspondent that Modi asked her whether she was still walking 20km a day. “I told him that because of the injury to my leg, I am restricting myself to 18km a day,” said a smiling Mamata, before adding that the two had a healthy “adda” for around 35 minutes. Mamata’s briefing on what transpired between her and Modi — during which only the two were present — may have had the limitations of government-to-government interaction. But the fact that she would continue with her anti-BJP politics was clear in her demand for an all-party meeting on Pegasus. On Monday, the Bengal chief minister had formed a two-member inquiry commission to look into the Pegasus controversy. With the concerted protests in Parliament and Mamata’s Delhi trip — during which she is scheduled to meet non-BJP leaders like Sonia Gandhi, Sharad Pawar, Arvind Kejriwal and Akhilesh Yadav — coinciding, the capital has been abuzz with speculation that the groundwork for a united fight against the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls has begun. Mamata, who met Congress veterans Kamal Nath, Anand Sharma and Abhishek Manu Singhvi on Tuesday, tried to play down expectations of any immediate breakthrough. She said that the discussions with other parties for a front to take on the BJP — a suggestion she had mooted during her July 21 address — would start once the Covid situation was under control. The pandemic-induced restrictions prevented her from visiting Parliament and meeting leaders of the other parties, she rued. Mamata, however, stressed that the planning for a united fight must start now. “The Lok Sabha polls are still some time away, but it’s also true that the planning has to start well in advance. You know that the elections for Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Tripura are approaching,” Mamata said. Sources close to her said that the Bengal chief minister, who held a meeting with Trinamul’s poll consultant Prashant Kishor on Tuesday, was trying to be cautious as she did not want to be seen as projecting herself as the face of a non-BJP front. “I will not lead, the country will lead.… We are all followers,” she said while responding to a question on who would lead such a front. On the issue of leadership and unity among the parties, Mamata said: “I think all these will happen automatically.… I am hopeful. Everyone lives with hope and if there is no hope, how can you live?” Another source said that the chief minister’s balanced response was part of a well-thought-out strategy. “She will be meeting Soniaji tomorrow and then there are other meetings.… Before those discussions, she can’t be seen to be upping the ante against the BJP. Instead of talking tough and raising the pitch, we all need to put our brains together and plan properly,” the source said. Mamata said that although she was scheduled to meet President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday, she was not sure whether the meeting would take place at all. “I have got my double vaccine, but I have been informed that I need a negative RTPCR report.... Where will I get it here in Delhi? But the President’s health is of utmost concern,” Mamata said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-387
28-07-2021||India||Congress blames Modi of bulldozing the principle of accountability||Parliament is not functioning because the Prime Minister is running away from answering questions and bulldozing the principle of accountability, the Congress said on Tuesday, rebutting Narendra Modi’s charge that the Opposition party was disrupting proceedings. “The Opposition is doing its duty and the Prime Minister is being undemocratic. He is showing raj-hath (arrogance of power),” Congress deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma told The Telegraph. “The Pegasus snooping row is no ordinary issue. It is extremely serious and directly related to national security. It is a joke that the Prime Minister thinks he can get away by making the new IT minister read a statement. Other democracies have initiated probe. India will have to order a probe. The deadlock is created because the government has not responded democratically. The government has acted in a manner that lowers the prestige of Parliament. The Opposition is struggling to prevent India from becoming a surveillance state,” he said. For the sixth day, neither House transacted any substantial business as the Opposition demanded a Supreme Court monitored investigation into the Pegasus spying controversy and the scrapping of the three farm laws against which thousands of farmers have been holding a sit-in at Delhi’s borders for eight months now. While several Opposition parties are protesting in the House, Modi singled out the Congress and asked BJP MPs to tell the “people and the media” that it was not allowing Parliament to function. Arguing that Modi just wanted to stonewall all questions on Pegasus and the farmers’ movement, Congress leader Sharma said: “What the Opposition is demanding is well within the rules of business and tradition of Parliament. Is it the first time a debate and an inquiry are being sought in a major scandal? Should the Congress close its eyes and let the government spy on everybody? And what has been the attitude of the government towards farmers? They are sitting on the road for eight months, isn’t that unprecedented in the history of independent India? Is the Prime Minister telling the nation Parliament is not meant for these vital issues?” Sharma said: “It is unfair and most unfortunate that the Prime Minister blamed us and asked the BJP MPs to expose the Congress for not allowing Parliament to function. It is the Prime Minister who is bulldozing the principle of accountability. He is running away, not answering questions and that’s why Parliament is not functioning.” Leader of the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, who addressed the media earlier along with leaders of several other Opposition parties, said: “It is wrong to say that the government is ready for discussion in Parliament. All the Opposition parties wanted discussion on Pegasus issue and farmers’ agitation even today but the government didn’t agree. We want the truth to come out in Pegasus row. When France, Hungary, Mexico and Israel have instituted probes, what does the Government of India want to hide? If the Government hasn’t done snooping, who allowed any other agency to do that? If snooping was done without permission, that has also to be investigated.” Kharge added: “This is not the way to function in a democracy. This is dictatorial. Modi is not ready to resolve any issue in a democratic spirit. The government says the Opposition parties are not willing for a dialogue. That is untrue. Call all the parties and discuss the way out of this stalemate.” The Trinamul Congress, DMK, Samajwadi Party, NCP, RJD, CPI and the CPM supported the demand for discussion and a Supreme Court-monitored probe. Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav said: “What is tragic is that the government is pressuring us to discuss bills which will write off lakhs of crores of bank loans. The bills that are against the interest of nation are more important for the government, not the issue that has imperilled national security. Not the farmers.” TMC’s Sukhendu Shekhar Roy asked: “Why is the government not interested in finding out who was snooping? Without discussing Pegasus and farmers, we will not allow any business. If these issues will not be debated in Parliament, where will they be discussed, in a coffee shop?” RJD’s Manoj Jha said: “Government is not ready for deliberation, only wants legislation…. What should we do – reduce Parliament to a lifeless concrete structure and Opposition should sign on the dotted line? This doesn’t happen. Democracy doesn’t function that way. Pegasus is not an ordinary development; very important people were kept under illegal surveillance.” Former finance minister P. Chidambaram asked: “Based on investigations by an international group of journalists, The Wire has reported that there was ‘an Indian client of the NSO Group.’ Who was the ‘Indian client’? Was it the Government of India? Was it an agency of the Government? Was it a private entity? I am certain the client’s name will be revealed soon. Until then, I suppose the Government will brazen out the allegations of snooping.” Digvijaya Singh also tweeted: “NSO which is under direct control of Israel government and therefore shall have a complete access to whatever information the client collects through Pegasus. Would it not compromise client’s national security? That is why we in opposition want either the Home Minister or the Prime Minister to brief the House and assure the nation that under no circumstances our national security would be compromised by anyone who has Pegasus software.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-387
28-07-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccine: India to have 150 million doses during August||India will have about 150 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines during August, a top health official said on Tuesday, indicating a quantum greater than in July but still not enough for the daily jabs needed to fully vaccinate the adult population by the year-end. The anticipated August supply will be around 30 million more than the 120 million doses that the Centre had said would be available during July as part of the 517 million doses to be supplied between January 2021 and July 31, 2021. “We have the visibility of about 15 crore (150 million) doses or so (for August),” said Vinod Paul, chair of the national expert group guiding Covid-19 vaccination policy and member health at Niti Aayog, the Centre’s apex technical think tank. The current pace of India’s vaccination campaign is almost entirely dictated by the availability of supplies, health officials and experts have said. While health officials have said India has the capacity to administer 8 to 10 million doses daily, the current supplies are inadequate to support that pace. The anticipated 150 million doses in August would support an average five million doses daily. This is significantly lower than the 9.4 million daily doses India would need to fully vaccinate its estimated 943 million people by December-end. The health ministry had told Parliament last week that there was “no fixed timeline” for the completion of the Covid-19 vaccination drive, but “it is expected that beneficiaries 18 years or older will be vaccinated by December 2021”. “We produce and we inject,” Paul said on Tuesday. “When we produce, part of the vaccine goes through testing at our central labs and the batches are released. We are visualising to the tune of about 15 crore…. Whatever is being produced is being used.” Under these circumstances marked by limited supplies but potentially large demand, experts say, vaccine shortages will be experienced at any site where the demand from the population rises. Such shortages could continue until the supplies increase. The Union health ministry said on Tuesday that the Centre was on track to supply 517 million doses to states or private hospitals up to July 2021 as planned. The Centre has supplied 457 million doses since January 2021 and an additional 60.3 million doses are expected to be supplied by July 31, the ministry said. The availability of doses until a particular month “does not mean that every dose supplied till that month is going to be consumed or administered” within that month, it added. “There would be supplies in the pipeline that should be available for the next few days until the next supplies of doses materialise to keep the vaccination going.” India had until Tuesday administered nearly 444 million doses. Over 96 million people (or about 10.1 per cent of the eligible population) have received both doses required for full protection. Some health experts have criticised what they view as opacity about monthly vaccine production figures. “We’re still in the dark about production capacities,” said R. Ramakumar at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, who has challenged certain aspects of the vaccination policy in the Supreme Court. The health ministry had said last month that it expected over 1.35 billion doses to be available during the August-December 2021 period, which would be sufficient to fully vaccinate the eligible population.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-387
28-07-2021||India||Union home ministry seeks six more months to frame CAA rules||The Union home ministry told Parliament on Tuesday that it had sought six more months to frame rules for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and had asked committees on subordinate legislation in the Lok Sabha as well as the Rajya Sabha time till January 9, 2022. This is the fifth extension sought by the Centre for framing the CAA rules, sources in the ministry said. According to the manual on parliamentary work, the rules for any legislation should be framed within six months of presidential assent or an extension should be sought. The controversial citizenship law had come into force from January 10, 2020. Without the rules being notified, the act remains ineffective. The BJP had promoted the CAA as one of its major poll planks in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Replying to a question by Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi, junior home minister Nityanand Rai told the Lok Sabha in a written reply that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, had been notified on December 12, 2019, and came into force from January 10, 2020. “The Committees on Subordinate Legislation, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, have been requested to grant further extension of time up to 09.01.2022 to frame the rules under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019,” Rai said. Gaurav had asked: “Whether the government is aware of missing the deadline to frame and notify CAA rules, if, so the steps taken by the government to frame it?” The CAA was passed by the Lok Sabha on December 9, 2019, and was given the assent by the President three days later. Sources said the home ministry had still been deliberating the CAA rules without making any headway. The rules will  clarify the types of documents needed to prove if an applicant came to India before the cut-off date, fixed by the law as December 31, 2014. The CAA proposes to fast-track Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Parsi and Christian communities who came to India before December 31, 2014. Critics feel  the law appears to be aimed at excluding Muslims. The CAA had triggered widespread protests as many feared that coupled with the planned countrywide National Register of Citizens (NRC), it would result in lakhs of Muslims losing their citizenship. Following the passage of the law in Parliament, the country had witnessed widespread protests leading to the death of over 100 people in police firing and related violence.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-387
28-07-2021||India||Chennai: Doctor who succumbed to Covid buried after fifteen months||Dr Simon Hercules’s body was placed in a coffin and he was laid to rest at the Kilpauk Christian Cemetery in Chennai this Sunday in the presence of his wife and children — one year and three months after he succumbed to Covid. Dr Hercules had passed away on April 19, 2020. But some residents, fearful of contracting the coronavirus infection, chased away the hearse from multiple burial grounds. Eventually, with the help of police, some of his colleagues had themselves prepared a grave in the dead of night and buried the doctor at a cemetery near the fringes of the city. A year-long legal battle waged by the neurosurgeon’s wife Anandhi Simon, a favourable verdict from Madras High Court and the intervention of new Tamil Nadu chief minister M.K. Stalin ensured that Dr Hercules’s body was exhumed and was given a formal burial at the Kilpauk Christian Cemetery on July 25 this year in keeping with Anandhi’s wish. This time, there were no protests or angry mobs stalling the last rites — a year of living with the coronavirus had helped jettison many of the unsubstantiated fears that had marked the initial days of the pandemic. “We are relieved that science has prevailed at last…,” Dr G. Leonard Ponraj, a sports medicine specialist and a colleague of Dr Hercules who stood by the bereaved family through the crisis, told The Telegraph. Dr Hercules, the director of New Hope Brain and Spine Centre in Chennai, had breathed his last at a private hospital last year after a two-week battle with Covid, the first case of a medical practitioner dying of the disease in the Tamil Nadu capital. Clearing the way for his re-burial, Madras High Court had said on March 31 this year that Dr Hercules’s case was a “shocking one as the incident had given a go-by to all human values”. Justice Abdul Quddhose wrote in his judgment: “The corpse of Dr Simon Hercules was shunted from one burial ground to another due to objections raised by heartless human beings to the burial of a Covid-19 victim.” On the night of April 19, 2020, the Greater Chennai Municipal Corporation had initially told Dr Hercules’s family and colleagues that he could be laid to rest at the burial ground at T.P. Chatram. But when they reached there, they were gheraoed by an angry crowd that objected to the burial of a Covid patient over fears that it could lead to the spread of the virus. Dr Hercules was then taken to the burial ground at Velangadu, where around 150 people gathered and attacked the ambulance with sticks and stones, forcing those accompanying the body to abandon it briefly. The crowd beat up and injured the ambulance driver and at least two hospital employees and forced the family to leave with the body. Multiple phone calls to the police did not help. Two hours later, when colleague and orthopaedic surgeon Pradeep Kumar heard from the police that the crowd had been controlled, the family and four of Dr Hercules’s colleagues set off for the Velangadu burial ground again in the damaged ambulance with police escorts. Wearing personal protective equipment, they prepared a grave and with the help of a single shovel left behind, they covered it with clay and soil. The treatment meted out to a doctor amid the pandemic had shocked the medical community and sparked outrage on social media. The police later arrested several persons for the violence. A day after Dr Hercules’s death, Anandhi requested the Greater Chennai Municipal Corporation that the body be exhumed and buried again at the Kilpauk Christian Cemetery in line with the family’s faith. The civic body rejected the plea on the ground that the process could lead to the spread of the virus and trigger similar demands from other bereaved families. Anandhi moved Madras High Court, citing her religious beliefs and urging it to direct the authorities to allow the exhumation and re-burial of Dr Hercules’s body. The court quashed the municipal corporation’s order. It cited various Supreme Court and high court rulings, including a recent judgment of Calcutta High Court on disposal of bodies that upheld the right of the “family of a Covid victim to perform the last rites as a right akin to a fundamental right”. Justice Quddhose extensively cited guidelines of the Union health ministry and WHO on the disposal of bodies of pandemic victims that clearly state that “transmission of Covid-19 is only through droplets” and that the possibility of infection spread through handling of bodies was unlikely. The court directed the civic authorities to allow the re-burial of Dr Hercules at the Kilpauk cemetery by observing all safety norms. However, the then commissioner of the municipal corporation appealed to a larger bench of the high court and got Justice Quddhose’s order stayed. “After the new DMK government took over earlier this year, we approached chief minister M.K. Stalin,” said Dr Ponraj, the colleague of Dr Hercules. “We told Stalin that there is a science behind this and that the previous corporation commissioner was ill-informed,” Dr Ponraj said. The chief minister directed the new corporation commissioner to withdraw the civic body’s appeal in the high court on July 20. Early this Sunday, Ananthi, her children, Dr Ponraj and others oversaw the exhumation of Dr Hercules’s body at the Velangadu burial ground. A JCB was pressed into service at 5am and within half an hour, the body was exhumed. The body was more or less intact as it had been packed in the “extra-thick triple layer plastic bags” used for Covid victims. Dr Hercules’s body was then placed in a coffin and taken to the Kilpauk cemetery where the re-burial went off without any hurdles. Dr Hercules’s family has thanked chief minister Stalin for his intervention. “I do not blame the former corporation commissioner, for he had not been adequately sensitised by experts. Today, bodies of Covid victims are even allowed to be taken home because there is greater awareness. We are relieved that science has prevailed at last and there is no politics to this,” Dr Ponraj said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-387
28-07-2021||India||Modi accuses Congress of blocking Parliament||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday singled out the Opposition Congress and accused the party of blocking Parliament as both Houses continued to be stalled for the sixth day over the snooping scandal, farm laws and other issues. Addressing a weekly meeting of BJP MPs, Modi asked them to “expose the Congress before the people and the media”, saying the Opposition party was deliberately not allowing Parliament to function. Modi singled out the Congress and attacked it despite the fact that other Opposition parties like the DMK, Trinamul Congress and the Left were also protesting and stalling Parliament. “Modiji said that the Congress was not only blocking Parliament but it was also not allowing efforts to resolve the deadlock succeed,” said one BJP MP, who attended the closed-door meeting. “He asked us to expose the Congress before the people and the media.” Party MPs said Modi particularly referred to the Congress’s boycott of the all-party meeting called by the government last week to review the Covid situation and added that it influenced others too to keep away. “The Congress prevented other parties also from attending the meet,” Modi was quoted as saying. The Congress, Akali Dal, AAP, RJD and the Left parties had boycotted the Prime Minister’s Covid review meet last week. Modi’s attack on the Congress came as both Houses of Parliament couldn’t transact any substantial business for the sixth day on Tuesday. The Congress despite being short of numbers was leading uproarious protests in both Houses and stalling the proceedings demanding a Supreme Court-monitored probe into the Pegasus phone snooping row and scrapping of the new farm laws. Modi had attacked the Congress at the meeting of party MPs last week too, seeking to paint it as the principal villain. The government appears to have succeeded in dividing the Opposition by managing most regional parties but the Congress continues to act as a spoiler. Though the government has passed some bills even in the din, it may not be able to push other key bills in the two Houses if they are not in order to have a proper discussion. Leader of the Rajya Sabha, Piyush Goyal, had on Monday invited Opposition leaders for a meeting to end the stalemate but they kept away saying they were not at the “beck and call” of the government and that the sudden invitation “smacked of arrogance”. Goyal’s invite came after RJD MP Manoj Jha accused the government of not making any substantial outreach to resolve the stalemate. In the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, where the government enjoys a brute majority, repeated appeals were made from the Speaker’s chair to let the House function, stressing the government was ready to discuss all issues. The Lok Sabha saw multiple adjournments, almost every half an hour, as the Congress, Trinamul and some other members waved placards and raised slogans against the government. The government has been trying to show that it was ready for discussions on all issues but it was the Opposition, particularly the Congress, which was bent on only obstructing Parliament proceedings. The monsoon session of Parliament commenced on July 19, a day after the Pegasus hacking row broke out, and is scheduled to continue till Aug 13.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-388

Y. Raghuvamshi, the police chief of Jangipur in Murshidabad district, on Wednesday will lead a team that will make public announcements across the town prohibiting children under the age of 15 to bathe in the rivers. The decision has been taken after two boys Ansarul Sheikh, 12 and Raju Sheikh, 12, drowned in the Ganga near Farakka while bathing on Tuesday morning, marking the fifth such incident since June and raising the fatality count to eight. “The Jangipur police district will be cautioned that starting tomorrow (Wednesday) until September, children below the age of 15 will not be allowed into rivers for bathing. They often bathe along with adults, but not knowing how to swim are prone to drowning as in today's unfortunate incident," said police superintendent Y. Raghuvamshi.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-155
28-07-2021||West Bengal||Bengal chief secretary asks district magistrates to find more sand mining areas ||Bengal chief secretary H.K. Dwivedi has asked district magistrates to explore new areas from where sand could be mined, an instruction which is a clear attempt to generate more revenue at a time when state coffers are struggling in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dwivedi gave the directive to the DMs during a video conference on Tuesday. “The chief secretary informed the DMs about the new sand mining policy the state cabinet had recently approved. The chief secretary also asked the DMs to explore new areas from where sand could be mined,” said a source. According to sources, the state government is trying to generate more revenues without levying new taxes on common people as the state exchequer is struggling in the backdrop of the pandemic and the recent launch of a series of new welfare schemes. “Scheme like Lakshmir Bhandar would require a sum of Rs 12,000 crore. The enhanced Krishak Bandhu Scheme would also require an additional amount of Rs 2,000 crore every year. The state is trying to find out new areas to enhance more revenue,” said a source. A senior bureaucrat said mining more sand would bring more revenue to the state exchequer as a sand mine usually fetches more than Rs 1 crore annually. Right now, the state auctions off about 250 sand mines across the state. “If the state can add 100 more mines to the list, it would bring about Rs 100 crore to the state exchequer. This is possible as sand is in high demand because of construction activities in the state. The state itself spends about Rs 30,000 crore a year in terms of infrastructure development,” said a bureaucrat. Sources said that demand for sand had decreased of late after the real estate sector was facing a slump because of the pandemic. “But the process to find out new sand mines could be termed as an effort for the future when the demand for sand would increase,” said a source. Dwivedi also explained to the DMs that henceforth, the auction of sand mines would be done centrally. The sources in the state secretariat said creating more mines could create more trouble for the state administration. “Often intra-party fights are reported from districts over the spoils of sand mines. Now, the job of the administration would be more tough as they have to rein in the powerful local leaders of the ruling party once new mines are auctioned off,” said a bureaucrat.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-155

Sources said two laptops, a camera, one scanner and some Aadhaar cards which appear to be fake have been seized from them. The arrested quintet have been identified as Ashim Sarkar and Swapan Sarkar from Alipurduar, Somen Bag and Ujjwal Sarkar from North 24-Parganas and Sanjay Oraon, the inhabitant of the tea estate. “It seems that they have cheated a number of people. Our officers are probing the case and gathering more information,” said Kuntal Banerjee, the additional police chief of Jaigaon. During the past few weeks, those dwelling in Dooars tea estates without Aadhaar are desperately scouting for options to get the cards as the state has made it mandatory to link Aadhaar with ration cards. Also, the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation has made it mandatory to link Aadhaar with PF accounts. “It seems that a section of people are trying to explore this opportunity and rackets have become active in the tea belt,” said a police officer. On Tuesday, the quartet were produced at a local court and remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-155
28-07-2021||West Bengal||Darjeeling politics descends into drama of absurdity||From exchanging political and moral science books to ploughing rice fields, politicians in the Darjeeling hills are performing well in the theatre of absurdity before a bemused public. On July 1, S.P. Sharma, the general secretary of the Akhil Bhartiya Gorkha League (Bharati Tamang faction) — the hills’ oldest political party is now divided into three factions, started demanding the resignation of Darjeeling BJP MP Raju Bista alleging that people had lost faith in him as the legislator had done precious little to take forward the political demand (of a separate state) forward. Bista shot back at Sharma armed with figures of the recently concluded Bengal Assembly elections. “People whose vote share was less than Nota do not have the right to seek my resignation,” said Bista. In the three hill seats of Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong, a total of 7,009 votes were cast in favour of Nota. The three candidates of Sharma’s party had cumulatively polled 4,939 votes. Bista’s charge on Sharma opened doors for new theatrics. Sharma and his party colleagues left a book on “political science” at Bista’s residence in Darjeeling recently so that Bista could read and understand that in “democracy, anyone can raise questions”. Darjeeling BJP MLA Neeraj Zimba then came to Bista’s defence. Zimba, who had last week circulated video of himself ploughing a rice field at Bungkulong — a village in Mirik but one that does not fall under his Darjeeling constituency — purportedly to help a poor farming family, announced his decision to send a “moral science” book to Sharma. “He (Sharma) is an agent of the state government. He has no political morality. I will send him a book on moral science soon,” Zimba said on Friday and used many words that some described as “racist”. Sharma did not take things lying low. The ABGL leader immediately issued a video providing the “two-in-one” MLA with a list of BJP politicians who needed to read moral science books. The “two-in-one” reference was for Zimba, a GNLF leader who was elected on a BJP ticket. Leaders who Sharma thought needed Zimba’s moral science book were Raju Bista for allegedly lying on Gorkhaland, GNLF leader Ajoy Edwards for not accepting Zimba’s candidature, Pratap Khati from the rival ABGL faction for stating that Scheduled Tribe status would be granted to 11 Gorkha communities by the Centre “one fine morning”. “Zimba should also read a fat book on moral science as he, too, has lied on numerous occasions. He should also send a book to B.P. Bajgain (Kurseong BJP MLA) for changing his stance on Gorkhaland issue and also to Sandeep Limbu (GNLF leader) for making false statements,” added Sharma. In between Bista-Sharma-Zimba episodes, the hills also witnessed Binay Tamang quitting his own faction in the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha. Bimal Gurung, who heads the other Morcha faction, also wept when Tamang decided to hand over the party flag to the former. “Politically, it has been an entertaining month so far,” quipped a local resident.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-155
28-07-2021||West Bengal||Visva-Bharati University authorities can’t force employees to donate: Calcutta High Court||Calcutta High Court on Tuesday held that university authorities had the right to donate funds for relief but not the power to forcibly collect funds from  employees. Justice Amrita Sinha of Calcutta High Court made this observation while hearing a petition filed by Visva-Bharati teachers who had challenged the legality of varsity vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty’s decision to deduct a day’s salary of teachers without their consent and sent the money to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund for Amphan aid. Justice Sinha, however, said as teachers had moved court challenging the VC’s decision about a year after the incident and the money collected had been spent, no order to varsity authorities to reimburse the sum. could be issued. In her final observation, the judge said: “…The University can always adopt ways and means to provide relief to those in need. It is not necessary that force has to be applied to reach the goal. Applying force is sharply contrary to the Rabindrik culture (the culture of Rabindranath Tagore) and tradition which Gurudev (Tagore) symbolises.” On May 29 last year, the VC had issued a notice that by virtue of the power vested in him, he had decided to deduct a day's salary of teachers and send it to the CM Relief Fund for Amphan aid. Challenging its validity, professors Sudipta Bhattacharya and others moved high court earlier this month saying no deduction could be made without employees’ consent. On Tuesday, Justice Sinha disposed of the petition. The counsel for teachers argued there was no provision in the Visva-Bharati Act, 1951, that granted powers of unilateral action on the university to deduct money from employees. Office-bearers of the Visva-Bharati University Faculty Association said they would move the high court’s division bench soon to seek an adjustment of the deducted salary from the account of the VC. “We welcome the court order but want responsibility fixed on the VC as our salary was deducted by authorities at his directive,” said a member of the teachers’ association. Officiating public relations officer of Visva-Bharati, Anirban Sircar, who is authorised to speak to the media, did not respond to calls or a text from this paper. Lawyers divided Lawyers of Calcutta High Court are divided over the decision to boycott the courtroom of Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal for his alleged “unethical activities”. On Tuesday, lawyers including Arunava Ghosh and Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya attended a meeting convened by Bar Association assistant secretary Ritzu Ghosal and took a resolution to boycott the court of Justice Bindal. In another meeting called by Bar Association secretary Dhiraj Trivedi, lawyers including association vice-president Ajoy Dubey passed a resolution declaring the earlier meeting as “invalid” and decided to keep attending Justice Bindal’s court. Tussle between lawyers and the acting chief justice started after the latter on May 17 had taken up the CBI’s prayer regarding the arrest of four leaders accused in the Narada case instead of sending it to a single judge bench.

28-07-2021||West Bengal||State govt asks Birbhum land department for action-taken report on land-grab through fake deeds ||The state government on Tuesday asked the Birbhum land department for an action-taken report on allegations of land-grab through fake deeds, a day after over 100 landowners demonstrated in front of the Bolpur land revenue office against the allegedly growing number of such cases in and around Santiniketan. “The additional district magistrate in charge of land has been asked to send the action-taken report following action against those who changed the land records or attempted to change them. In all those cases, police complaints would be filed,” said a senior Nabanna official. On Monday, landowners submitted at least 50 such instances where ownership in land records was either changed or an attempt was made to do so. After Tuesday’s directive from Nabanna, district land department officials ordered the verification of every instance, to ascertain if the deeds were, indeed, forged. “We will check every complaint separately, and will lodge a police complaint shortly against those who submitted forged deeds,” said Subhrojyoti Ghosh, the additional district magistrate (land) in Birbhum. Birbhum district magistrate Bidhan Chandra Ray held a special meeting on Monday evening with Ghosh and directed to take the issue seriously. “Action will be taken very soon,” said Ray. Sources said according to the government rule, the landowners should be informed by the land department before the records are changed. However, those whose land records have allegedly been changed in the past three years said they did not get any intimation from the department. According to a senior land department official, earlier, a letter through a registered post used to be sent to the landowners before change of the records. Now, the government issues the letter online and a hard copy is sent via post to the landowners. “Ownership of our four bighas of land was changed in 2018, but I did not receive any such letter. It is very strange that the record was changed keeping the owner in the dark. Although the person who forged my land document was arrested, rectification of the change has not been done yet,” said Supriyo Sadhu, the headmaster of the Bolpur High School, an alleged victim. Postal department sources said in many cases they found such registered letters are sent to false addresses and wrong pin codes. “We take the booking as per pin codes, not by names or addresses. If someone changes even a single digit of the pin code, our postmen can’t find it,” said a postal department official. Landowners who lodged complaints against the “land mafia” said most of the owners are government employees or farmers while others live outside the state or even abroad. “Is it possible to track the property records every day by logging on to the website of the land department? There is a racket doing this (forging land deeds) through a channel that the government can’t ignore. We will have another meeting to decide our next step against these illegal activities,” said a resident of Bolpur who said he “caught an alleged attempt” to change his land records.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-156
28-07-2021||West Bengal||Trinamul Congress leaders ‘kidnap at gunpoint’ 11 panchayat colleagues in Malda ||Eleven elected Trinamul members of Daulatnagar panchayat, under Harischandrapur-II block of Malda, were on Tuesday morning allegedly abducted by two party leaders, including panchayat head Najibur Rahman, when they came to the BDO’s office to table a no-confidence against Najibur. Twelve members, including two women, were apparently held at gunpoint while they were heading towards the BDO’s chamber for official formalities to apply for a no-confidence motion. One of the women managed to flee and she somehow reached home. The whereabouts of the rest 11 members, including the other woman, are still not known. As the news of this bizarre incident spread, hundreds of Trinamul supporters assembled in the area and blocked a road to demonstrate, alleging that Najibur and Ashraful Haque, the husband of the sabhapati (chief) of the Trinamul-run Harishchandrapur-II panchayat samiti of Daulatnagar panchayat, where Trinamul is in power, had abducted the panchayat members at gunpoint. With the roadblock continuing for hours, a police contingent led by Sanjay Biswas, the inspector in charge of Harischandrapur police station rushed to the spot. It took over two-and-a-half hours for the police to persuade Trinamul workers, who were demanding immediate release of the abducted members, to lift the roadblock. Protesters said that for the past few months, corruption charges were being levelled against Najibur. “As a result, 12 other members of our party at the rural body decided to table a no-confidence motion against him so that he could be removed,” said Rajendra Ghosh, a local Trinamul leader. Altogether, there are 20 seats at the panchayat. In 2018, Trinamul won 18 seats and bagged the panchayat. “These 12 members had submitted a letter to the BDO citing they wanted to table the no-confidence motion. On Tuesday, the BDO asked all of them to personally come to him so that their signatures could be verified. As they reached near the BDO office around 9am, Najibur and Ashraful along with other hooligans held them at gunpoint and forced to get into vehicles. Then they were whisked away,” Rajamul Haque, another protester, said. BDO Bijay Giri, when asked about the event, conceded that the panchayat members had been abducted by some “miscreants” from near his office. “We have reported the incident to the district administrations and also to the police. CCTV footage of my office and adjoining areas will be checked to find out the abductors,” said Giri. The police, sources said, are trying to trace the abducted members. “Our investigations have started. We are also trying to identify the abductors,” said a police officer. At the time of filing this report, none of the hostages had been released. Repeated calls by this paper to the cell phones of Najibur and Ashraful also failed to elicit a response. Their whereabouts are also not known. The incident left district Trinamul leaders red-faced. “Our party does not approve of such activities. The incident is being viewed very seriously by the district leadership and leaders of the block have been asked to submit a confidential report on the entire issue,” said Dulal Sarkar, a senior party leader in Malda. Gobinda Chandra Mandal, the district BJP chief, called the incident a blatant instance of acute infighting within Trinamul. “It is the fallout of a tussle between two corrupt factions of Trinamul. Both sides want to make illegal earnings by using their position as elected representatives,” he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-156
28-07-2021||West Bengal||Covid-19: Bengal logs 662 new cases, 10 deaths ||Bengal on Tuesday logged 662 Covid-19 cases, 10 deaths and 838 recoveries as the state completed 23 consecutive days of logging less than 1,000 infections. The total of active cases fell by 186 to 11,380 on Tuesday. With Calcutta logging 54 infections and North 24-Parganas 81, Tuesday was also the 20th consecutive day since the second wave struck when none of Bengal’s 23 districts reported a three-digit figure of new infections. The recovery rate in the state is currently at an all-time high of 98.07 per cent, fairly ahead of the national rate of 97.36. Seventeen districts reported double-digit figures of new infections detected in a day. Kalimpong, North Dinajpur, South Dinajpur, Malda, Murshidabad, Birbhum and Purulia reported single-digit figures. The daily positive confirmation rate, which was nearly 33 per cent at the peak of the second wave, was 1.54 per cent on Tuesday. Sixteen Bengal districts, including Calcutta, reported zero deaths on Tuesday, while Darjeeling, Nadia, East Midnapore, East Burdwan and West Burdwan, and Hooghly reported one each. The state’s mortality rate is 1.19, while that of the nation is 1.34 per cent. Bengal has till now recorded nearly 15.25 lakh Covid-19 cases. The total includes over 14.95 lakh recoveries and 18,095 deaths.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-156
28-07-2021||West Bengal||Mamata Banerjee government files affidavit before Calcutta High Court to counter NHRC ||The Mamata Banerjee government on Tuesday filed a 95-page affidavit before Calcutta High Court, taking exception to the report submitted by a National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) probe committee to the court on alleged post-poll results violence in Bengal. The affidavit placed by state home secretary B.P. Gopalika described as “sweeping homilies, absurd and false” the report of the NHRC committee, which the chief minister had called “a great liar”. The report, which the BJP has gone to town with since, had named several current and former lawmakers of the Trinamul Congress, including a senior minister, in its list of 123 “notorious criminals/goons”. The state government’s affidavit countered every point and allegation in the report of the eight-member committee to convince the five-judge bench of the high court that the report was biased and based on the false allegations that the state’s BJP leaders had been levelling against the ruling party after their miserable defeat in the Assembly elections. In the report, the committee had made several remarks in virtual echo of the BJP, describing the Bengal situation as “a manifestation of “law of ruler”, instead of “rule of law”, and calling the alleged violence “retributive”, perpetrated by the ruling party against supporters of “the main Opposition party”. Gopalika’s affidavit mentioned much of what the chief minister had repeatedly been saying. Mamata Banerjee had been saying the violence had taken place before the results when the law and order machinery was under the Election Commission of India. On May 4, governor Jagdeep Dhankhar gave her control as a caretaker, but she had no real control on the police administration. On May 5, after her swearing-in, Mamata undertook a total change of the set-up of the police and civil administration for effective control of the law and order, undoing the alleged damage of sweeping changes made by the commission. Mamata said on July 22 that her government would respond to every point raised in the report, pointing out that a key part of the committee — a member of the NHRC — instrumental in filing it had a prominent BJP background. The affidavit tried to prove that at least three on the eight-member committee were well connected with the BJP. The affidavit claimed that the committee did not have the power to make recommendations in its report for the state administration to implement them. “I state that the committee has no power to recommend any course of action, as has been done in the report,” asserted Gopalika in the affidavit, citing the order the larger bench had issued on June 18. In its long list of recommendations, the committee endorsed most of the demands being made so far by the BJP, such as probes by the CBI, trials outside Bengal, a witness protection scheme, ex-gratia payments, compensation for alleged damages, static pickets of central forces, and action against “delinquent” government servants. The affidavit claimed that the so-called recommendations were invalid and illegal, and countered every allegation with references, stating police action already taken with regard to the complaints. The matter will come up for court’s scanning on Wednesday when the lawyers of both the sides will argue their cases. PIL against Mukul post Ambika Roy, a BJP MLA from Nadia’s Kalyani, on Tuesday filed a public interest litigation in Calcutta High Court demanding removal of Mukul Roy from his post of chairman of public accounts committee in the Assembly. Roy, who won from Nadia’s Krishnanagar seat with a BJP ticket, joined Trinamul after the results were out. BJP protested against Roy’s nomination as the chairman of the PAC in the Assembly and accused Trinamul of taking control of the post.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/page-156
28-07-2021||North East||Assam-Mizoram border clash: States agree on deployment of CAPF ||A neutral central force will be deployed along the disturbed Assam-Mizoram border where five policemen and a civilian were killed following a bloody clash recently, officials said Wednesday.  The decision was taken after a two-hour long meeting chaired by Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla and attended by Assam Chief Secretary Jishnu Baruah and Director General of Police Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta and their respective Mizoram counterparts Lalnunmawia Chuaungo and SBK Singh.  Both state governments have agreed for the deployment of a neutral Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) at the disturbed interstate border along the National Highway 306, a Home Ministry official said.  The neutral force will be commanded by a senior officer of the CAPF.  Besides, in order to facilitate the functioning of the force, both the state governments will work out arrangements in coordination with the Union Home Ministry within a reasonable timeframe.  The home secretary also conveyed to the delegations of Assam and Mizoram that the two governments should continue discussions mutually to resolve the border issue in an amicable manner, the officials said.  The chief secretaries and the police heads of Assam and Mizoram were called by the union home ministry to resolve the ongoing border conflict between the two states.  Later, talking to reporters, the Mizoram chief secretary said the situation along the interstate border is currently peaceful and it was agreed in the meeting that everyone will try to maintain peace and there was no point in indulging in violence.  State forces are being withdrawn from the disputed area, he said.  The Assam chief secretary said the CAPF will take over the responsibility of the inter-state border.  The process of withdrawal of state police forces is being worked out, he said.  Earlier, another home ministry official said that the central government was concerned over the border dispute which led to violence and deaths of six people.  The objective of the meeting is to lower the tension, bring peace and possibly find a solution, the official said.  The Director General of CRPF also attended the meeting as the personnel of the paramilitary force have currently been deployed in the Assam-Mizoram border areas where tension is high, the official said.  Five Assam Police personnel and a civilian were killed and over 50 others including a superintendent of police were injured when the Mizoram Police opened fire on a team of the Assam officials Monday.  Assam's Barak Valley districts of Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi share a 164-km long border with three Mizoram districts of Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit.  After counter-allegations of encroachment of territory over the past few weeks and skirmishes that escalated tensions between the two states, violent clashes were reported along the inter-state border that ended in the death of five Assam Police men and a civilian.  The incidents came two days after Union Home Minister Amit Shah held talks with the chief ministers of eight northeastern states and underscored the need to resolve lingering border disputes. Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga on Wednesday made an appeal to the people to refrain from any sort of violence amid border dispute with Assam that escalated after a clash between police forces of the two North-eastern states that left seven people dead and over 50 injured. His appeal came when certain organisations of the neighbouring Barak Valley region of Assam observed a 12-hour bandh on Wednesday and have been staging an economic blockade on the National Highway-306 that connects Mizoram with the rest of the country since July 26, disrupting transportation of goods to the state. Zoramthanga's plea is seen as a message to a section of the people who may attack non-Mizos as a fallout of the blockade which, if not lifted quickly, might lead to scarcity of essential commodities in the state.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-16
28-07-2021||North East||Trinamul Congress leaders to reach Tripura on Wednesday||A high-level Trinamul Congress delegation from Bengal will visit Tripura on Wednesday to assess the northeastern state’s political situation and the party’s organisational strength and to meet its poll consultant Prashant Kishor’s I-PAC team members who have been under alleged house arrest since Monday morning. Trinamul’s Tripura unit president Ashish Lal Singh told The Telegraph that three senior party leaders — Moloy Ghatak, Bratya Basu and Ritabrata Banerjee — would reach Agartala on Wednesday. The I-PAC members have been under “house arrest” at a hotel in Agartala since early Monday morning. Police, however, rejected the allegations of house arrest. The police said they had come from outside and needed Covid-19 negative reports to step out “Seventeen I-PAC members arrived here on July 17 and five on July 20. They have been asked to stay put in the hotel till Covid-19 test reports arrive,” said an official. Singh said Trinamul supporters on Tuesday staged demonstrations in the state to protest against the “murder of democracy” under the BJP-led regime and referred to the treatment meted out to I-PAC members, who had been divided into six teams to carry out political survey in the eight districts of Tripura. “We are travelling to Agartala (tomorrow) on Wednesday to stand by those harassed by the BJP regime which is living in fear of Trinamul’s rise in Tripura,” said Ghatak, a Bengal minister.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/page-16
28-07-2021||North East||Assam-Mizoram border clash: Govt convenes meet with senior officials||The Union home ministry has convened a meeting with senior Mizoram and Assam officials in New Delhi on Wednesday to find ways to douse the inter-state border dispute that left six Assam policemen dead and another 45 injured on Monday. The clashes took place two days after Union home minister Amit Shah discussed inter-state border disputes in the Northeast at a meeting with chief ministers from the region. No untoward incident has been reported since Monday night but the inter-state border area is tense. Sources from Lailapur in Assam’s Cachar district and Vairengte in Mizoram’s Kolasib district, the sites hit by the violence on Monday, said no one ventured out with vehicles despite heavy security deployment. Cachar residents have imposed a blockade at Kabuganj, about 26km from the border, disrupting traffic movement. The Barak Democratic Front in Assam has called a bandh on Wednesday. Official sources in Aizawl and Guwahati said the chief secretaries and the police chiefs of both the states have been summoned by the Union home ministry for a meeting with home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla. This will be the second meeting between the Union home ministry and officials from the two states since July 9 on the border skirmishes. The last was inconclusive. Assam and Mizoram have blamed each other for the “unfortunate” developments but those following the skirmishes said it was a tragedy waiting to happen since June-end when a fresh round of flare-up erupted. Mizoram was a part of Assam till 1972. Efforts for a breakthrough since 1995 to resolve the border dispute have not made much progress. While Assam has a BJP-led coalition government, the Mizo National Front (MNF) governs Mizoram. The MNF is part of the BJP-led NDA at the Centre but the two political forces are not allies in Mizoram. A Union home ministry media note on Tuesday said the Centre had been unwavering in its focus on inter-state disputes. It said such problems could be resolved only with the cooperation of the state governments and that the Centre acted as a facilitator for amicable settlement of disputes in the spirit of mutual understanding. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday said in Silchar the state would not concede even an inch of land to Mizoram. He said his government had decided to deploy three commando battalions in Cachar, Karimgaj and Hailakandi districts bordering Mizoram. Sarma said on Tuesday night that one more policeman succumbed to his abdominal injuries, taking the death toll to six since Monday. Some of the injured policemen have been shifted to Guwahati for treatment. The Cachar superintendent of police was airlifted to Mumbai. Sarma announced an ex gratia of Rs 50 lakh to the next of kin of each of the deceased and a government job for a member of each family. The injured police personnel will receive Rs 1 lakh each while those deployed along the 164.6km-long Assam-Mizoram border will get an additional payment equal to a month’s salary. Sarma said clear evidence was emerging that Mizoram police and those backed by them had fomented trouble, adding that Assam would seek the intervention of the Supreme Court for the protection of the inner-line reserve forest from destruction and encroachment by Mizoram residents. “Six jawans laid down their lives to save the land of Assam and save the forests of our country. We will keep dying but will not give away our land. We will resist and retreat but not open fire at our countrymen. Assam is a responsible state and will behave responsibly. I will personally see to it that there is no economic blockade disrupting the supply chain to Mizoram as the state does not have any other gateways,” Sarma said. A seven-member Congress delegation led by newly appointed Assam unit president Bhupen Kumar Borah will visit Cachar to take stock of the border situation on Wednesday. Mizoram home minister Lalchamliana had said on Monday that “around 200” armed Assam policemen led by an inspector-general of police had reached the Variengte autorickshaw stand around 11.30am on Monday and damaged several vehicles travelling along the national highway between Vairengte and Lailapur, a trigger for the subsequent flare-up. On Tuesday, Lalchamliana accused the CRPF, deployed along the disputed inter-state border, of failing to carry out its “responsibility” as a neutral force. Lalchamliana alleged that CRPF personnel had allowed Assam forces to enter Mizoram and forcibly take over a duty post manned by the Mizoram police on the outskirts of Vairengte. Another Mizoram minister, the local MLA and the village council chief of Vairengte levelled similar allegations. Central paramilitary personnel are deployed along the Mizoram-Assam border by the Centre to defuse tension and maintain peace. While the CRPF is deployed on the Mizoram side, the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) is camping on the Assam side in Lailapur. “The central paramilitary jawans (of the CRPF) were not honouring their responsibility as a neutral force to maintain peace and prevent violent clashes,” Lalchamliana said. He claimed that CRPF jawans refused to provide protection to the Kolasib SP and other police officers when they rushed to the camp of the paramilitary force at the time of exchange of fire between forces of Mizoram and Assam on Monday. Lalchamliana has spoken to CRPF inspector-general Sarbjit Singh and urged him to look into the matter and take necessary action, an official statement said. According to the statement, the CRPF will probe the allegation that some Mizoram police officers were denied security during the clash.

28-07-2021||Opinion||Letters to the editor: Mirabai Chanu wins silver at Olympics, deteriorating condition of the Great Barrier Reef||Moment of glory Sir — India has reasons to be elated because for the first time in its history, the country has won an Olympic medal on the very first day of the event (“Chanu lifts India out of bronze age”, July 25). For Mirabai Chanu, who failed at all her three attempts in the clean and jerk section at Rio de Janeiro five years back, winning a silver medal in Tokyo was nothing less than redemption and a show of grit. Not only did she have to literally lift weight, but she also had to bear the weight of the hopes of the millions; and she did not disappoint. Chanu’s silver will hopefully encourage many youngsters to pick this sport as a career. May this be the first of many medals India wins in this edition. Bal Govind,Noida Sir — Mirabai Chanu must be congratulated for ending India’s two-decade long wait for a medal in weight-lifting at the Olympics by winning silver this time. Her historic triumph is the fruit of five years of hard work, after her failure at the Rio Olympics. That Chanu won a silver on the opening day should help boost the morale of the entire contingent and motivate other athletes to win medals this time. It is also encouraging that the Indian Olympic Association has decided to reward her coach, Vijay Shankar. But Rs 10 lakh seems to be a pittance; the association should increase the amounts to Rs 20 lakh for a gold medal, Rs 15 lakh for silver and Rs 10 lakh for bronze for the winners’ coaches. Janaki Mahadevan,Chennai Sir — Congratulations to Mirabai Chanu for creating history at the Tokyo Olympics by winning the first silver medal for India in weight-lifting. Interestingly, this is also the first time that India has won a medal on the opening day in any Olympics edition. With this win, Chanu buried the ghosts of the 2016 Games at Rio de Janeiro where she finished without any successful lifts. As a 13-year old girl from a low-income family living in a nondescript village in Imphal, Chanu was tenacious and uncompromising with her dream of earning fame as a sportsperson. Her efforts — years of rigorous workouts, travelling 22 kilometres by bus every day in the early morning for training — have finally borne fruit. Ranganathan Sivakumar,Chennai Sir — The first day of the Tokyo Olympics was marked by Mirabai Chanu winning a silver medal. Clearly, Indian women prove their mettle in every field. One must also acknowledge the efforts of the sports ministry for initiatives such as ‘Khelo India’, which has been a boon for sports enthusiasts. This has encouraged especially those from rural backgrounds to display their talents. These days, several athletes from rural areas take interest in sports. More youngsters from both rural and urban parts of the country should select sport as a career. The sports ministry should open sports universities in all Indian cities and districts and help sports lovers acquire basic education in the field. The future of Indian sports looks bright and one expects that in the days to come Indians will dominate the world of sports at the international level. Syed Nissar,Hyderabad Sir — Mirabai Chanu must be lauded for winning the silver medal. The good start to the prestigious global sports event with over 200 participating countries is encouraging for the country. With proper planning and focus on its demography, India can reap rich dividends with regard to competitive sports and improve its records in the field. Young sportspersons in the country are shining in spite of all odds. D.V.G. Sankararao,Nellimarla, Andhra Pradesh Sir — The star weightlifter, Mirabai Chanu, deserves to be congratulated for winning silver in the women’s 49 kilogrammes category. Undoubtedly, this stunning achievement of the ace sportswoman would boost the confidence of all other Indian players who are participating in this edition and one hopes this helps them clinch more medals for our country. Sourish Misra,Calcutta  Wrong list Sir — Given the deteriorating condition of the Great Barrier Reef, the Unesco had rightly decided to downgrade its World Heritage status. But Australia has managed to defer this move, asking for more time to work on conservation measures. This is a poor excuse; the government was issued a warning as early as 2014. The ‘in danger’ list could have protected the Great Barrier Reef to some extent. But, clearly, it is more important for the government to protect its reputation. One hopes that the country wakes up to the threat of climate change before it is too late. Sraddha Mehta,Calcutta||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-60
28-07-2021||Opinion||Editorial: Hard lesson||Indians tend to display a misplaced and mistimed optimism. The end of last year offered enough evidence to suggest that school-leaving examinations were unlikely to take place in 2021 — the experience of 2020 was a warning. Alternative plans of grading at the school level and admission strategies for colleges or universities could have been formulated without haste. Since all-India and state boards all have different methods of marking and testing, early planning could have ensured equivalence. Apparently, hope sprang almost eternal among decision-makers until examinations were cancelled because of the pandemic and formulae for assessment had to be hurriedly worked out. Predictably, high marks in general and the high percentages of successful candidates recorded in the Class X and Class XII results have not guaranteed happiness all round. While an overall sense of relief may be evident, a number of candidates with high marks have regretted the absence of in-person examinations. Mathematics results, for example, have disappointed Indian School Certificate students and left them worried about their future options. Grading or marking that relies wholly on averaging scores of earlier examinations and internal assessments tends to be unfair to the potential of the best candidates; also, the consistency offered by a board examination cannot be replicated perfectly when the results are computed from the marking of individual schools. Results for Class XII are crucial for the students’ futures. The high percentage of successful candidates is causing worry about the adequacy of college and university seats, while students who failed, as some did under the West Bengal higher secondary board, protested, occasionally with violence, since they felt that without an examination either everyone passes or everyone fails. This logic must have touched their board, for a review has found 90 per cent among them successful. A happier end, but no less confusing. Further, undergraduate admissions would depend largely on Class XII results without admission tests or interviews, possibly leading to numerous applicants against each decimal point. Besides, the best candidates under boards with stricter marking would be likely to fall behind those in systems more generous with marks. This is a hard lesson about purely examination-based assessments that should have been reviewed years ago. It is the greatest pity that the short-sightedness of policymakers should affect most the aspiring young.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-60
28-07-2021||Opinion||Editorial: Southern spice||Politics can turn the seemingly indispensable into the expendable. The present fate of B.S. Yediyurappa, the former chief minister of Karnataka who has had to relinquish his chair ‘sans coercion’, is a case in point. Mr Yediyurappa had been the architect of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s meteoric rise in Karnataka, the first southern state to fall into its kitty. His ouster has led to considerable speculation about the probable causes. His advanced years and the persistent charges of corruption — Mr Yediyurappa had been ‘sacked’, leading to a split in the BJP some years ago — are factors that may have gone against him. But these, at best, are partial explanations. In Kerala, the BJP had chosen an octogenarian as the chief ministerial candidate; so Mr Yediyurappa’s age is unlikely to have been a formidable obstacle. The real reason lies in the transformation that the BJP has undergone under the watch of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. There is a perceptible shift in favour of centralization within the party, with the leadership in New Delhi frowning upon ambitious or independent regional leaders. Mr Yediyurappa is both. He carved out his own path to political glory by cobbling together an ingenuous coalition along the lines of caste and community to bring the BJP to power. His ambiguity towards Hindutva may not have gone down too well with a leadership that is known to be hawkish ideologically. For a party that is accustomed to poking fun at the Congress for its reverence to the ‘high command culture’, the BJP is, arguably, doing a splendid task of imitating the top-heavy architecture of its principal adversary. The shadow of corruption may limit Mr Yediyurappa’s ability to manoeuvre but the Lingayats — they form 17 per cent of Karnataka’s population — including the influential seers of mutts, have rallied behind the deposed chief minister. With Mr Yediyurappa’s exit, the broader social coalition that he had stitched to propel the BJP may unravel. If this were to happen, the party is likely to incur political costs in the next assembly elections. Mr Yediyurappa has, so far, pledged fealty to his bosses but the word is that the BJP’s immediate future in Karnataka could well hinge upon the fact whether Mr Yediyurappa retains the stomach for taking the fight to the BJP. The southern pot, evidently, will be on the boil for a while.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-60
28-07-2021||Opinion||The man who cries wolf||Whatever your views on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you’ve got to credit his government for the consistency and predictability of its response when faced with a political crisis. Whether it’s criticism of its human rights record or a global investigation revealing the use of Israeli spyware against those it views as opponents, you know Modi’s team will argue it’s a conspiracy to defame the prime minister and — since Modi to them is synonymous with India — the country. It’s a strategy that works when most people don’t know better. But like the boy who cried wolf, there’s only so many times it works before even those who want to believe you start wondering if they’re being played. And for the Modi government, the problem is particularly serious: a prime minister who has long craved global validation now finds himself exposed before the world, thanks to back-to-back crises that have resonated internationally. Over the past few days, an international collaboration of media organizations has uncovered extensive spying and hacking of phones across dozens of countries using the spyware named Pegasus. Globally, the targets for spying and hacking identified by the Pegasus Project include the French president, Emmanuel Macron, Morocco’s king, Mohammed VI, the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, the former Mexican president, Felipe Calderón, Emirati princesses, judges, journalists and more. In India, the list ranges from the Congress leader, Rahul Gandhi — who changes his device frequently but still couldn’t evade the Pegasus spyware — and a set of journalists and activists to even a Supreme Court employee who had accused a former Chief Justice of India of sexual harassment. The response from the government and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has been unsurprising — even if contradictory at times. The junior foreign minister, Meenakshi Lekhi, called the reports on spying “fake”, claiming that Amnesty International, which procured the list of Pegasus targets, has denied the existence of such a catalogue of names (it has, in fact, said that it stands by the investigation). Assam’s chief minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, also from the BJP, has asked the Central government to act against Amnesty for trying to taint Modi’s image. Not to be left behind, the home minister, Amit Shah, has blamed the revelations on “disruptors” that he describes as “global organizations which do not like India to progress”. And the former information and technology minister, Ravi Shankar Prasad, has insinuated a conspiracy by falsely claiming that India was being selectively questioned from among the dozens of countries believed to have used Pegasus. Yet, the government has refused to clearly deny that it has purchased Pegasus. Independent forensics analysis on several of the phones in the target list, including those of several journalists, has shown that they were indeed infected by the spyware. NSO, the Israeli group that owns Pegasus, insists that it only licenses the product to governments. So if the Indian government isn’t the one hacking — and potentially manipulating content on — the phones of political opponents, journalists, activists and others, is a foreign power behind the use of the spyware? And if that’s the case, why isn’t the Modi government, which, otherwise, likes to tom-tom its national security credentials, at all alarmed? It’s hardly the first time that the Modi government has been caught with its hand in the cookie jar. And whether it’s the overnight revocation of Kashmir’s autonomy, the ill-advised step of demonetization or the government’s systematic erosion of India’s democratic institutions, much has been written in the international press in the past that’s critical of Team Modi. But the global scale of the Pegasus hacking makes the Modi administration’s assault on Indian democracy a part of a wider international story that people around the world can relate to. And these revelations come close after the government’s monumental failures in preparing for the second wave of Covid-19 that made India the headline story the world over for the wrong reasons. Unlike Kashmir and demonetization, the pandemic is a shared experience for people across the planet. So when they see images of unclaimed bodies floating down the Ganga, it hits home — everywhere. To be sure, other governments — whether in the United States of America or Europe — aren’t genuinely concerned about civil liberties. As long as they see India as a valuable strategic partner, especially in countering China, they would like to ignore the wounds Modi is inflicting on this country. But in mature democracies, ruling dispensations must at least appear to heed the views of their people. If most ordinary Americans and Europeans start pushing back against a business-as-usual relationship with the Modi government, just as they have when it comes to ties with another strategically vital ally, Saudi Arabia, it becomes hard for elected leaders in Washington, Brussels and elsewhere to ignore those concerns. Put simply, Modi’s global reputation is today at its lowest ebb since he came to power in 2014. And crying wolf once again won’t fix it.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-60
28-07-2021||Opinion||Hide and seek||Did an Unidentified Flying Object land in the vicinity of Patparganj, East Delhi, on a rainy, deliciously pleasant night earlier this month? A wide-eyed visitor, returning and rediscovering Delhi after an eight-year absence, certainly thought so upon sighting, from a distance, an incandescent dome, with blades of light splitting open a sable night sky. But then UFOs are notoriously elusive beings; a closer, clearer view from atop Barapullah, the flyover that snakes its way towards Patparganj, identified the object to be the mausoleum of a sleeping emperor. That night, Humayun’s tomb, restored magnificently through a public-private partnership involving various arms of the government, the Archaeological Survey of India, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, materialized as a wondrous, regal and — strangely — potent symbol; as if it was, still is, a repository of power. The seat of political power of the Republic, the Sansad Bhavan, appeared in an inexplicable light the following morning. Almost obscured by a thick haze of dust arising from a mangled Rajpath — the mutilation bearing evidence of the impending, monstrous Central Vista, allegedly a vanity project of a modern emperor — the edifice of Parliament is likely to strike an observer of the Republic and its goings-on to be markedly limpid, as if the vitality of democracy is being sapped from its veins. This strange inversion — an ancient mausoleum appearing to be living and livelier than the chamber of a modern, sovereign institution —  assumes significance in the light of what is argued about the relationship among architecture, power and principal cities in Power and Architecture: The Construction of Capitals and the Politics of Space (edited by Michael Minkenberg). The Introduction notes that “… architecture and urban design are… a manifestation… of space in a politicized sense, that is… public space manipulated by political interests.” This process of politicization is intense and, hence, most discernible in capital cities which, “in the age of the nation-state” are invested with the primary responsibility of linking — integrating — the national imagination with urban spatiality through architecture. But the integration, Minkenberg concedes, can be problematic: “In reality, underlying power struggles and tensions… obscure the message of [orchestrated?] national harmony…” Receptivity to this stubborn, subterranean tension can be the key to comprehending — and appreciating — history and historiography and their complex relationship with urban landscapes and their transformations. The sentient, metaphorical equivalent of history’s seductions, especially those of history on the street, may, arguably, be that of an itch, an irritation that is meant not to lull but awaken the senses to alternative possibilities. Consider the many soothing tree-lined boulevards in India’s capital. To the untrained eye, they may simply be spaces of shade and repose, especially in a city that gets roasted by a relentless sun well into July. Yet, history can nudge you awake from this uninformed siesta. In a report titled “Planning Policy and Landscape Architecture: Street Design in Theory and Practice”, Sylvia Nieves Leon Guerrero demonstrates, quite convincingly, that interventions in urban design and development are seldom innocent; each is a calculated response to a dilemma — usually a threat — that could be political, philosophical, or both. For instance, in post-revolutionary France, as Paris was being transformed under the watchful eyes of Georges-Eugène Haussmann, the ‘Baron’ insisted on the incorporation of the boulevard as a bulwark against the chaos symbolized by revolution and poverty. Even the street — or the marg, if you are a Delhiwallah — evolved as an element integral to the notion of orderliness, which, in turn, is an idea that is as aesthetic as it is political. Little wonder then that the street remains the turf of enduring battles between the State and the krantikaris — be they farmers, dissenters, activists or the dispossessed. Leon Guerrero also notes, cheekily, that the barricade, ubiquitous during bandobasts and public demonstrations in the metropolis, made its maiden appearance during the French Revolution as a means — symbolic and literal — to assert State control over the street. History’s rap on the knuckles of urban design is especially hard in capital cities that, the architect, Amos Rapoport, argues, “provide a particular stage for political and cultural spectacle, drama, and rituals, and… communicate high-level meanings to… citizens”. Walking around Alimuddin Street in Calcutta, a former capital now stripped of its imperial charms, a sharp-eyed pedestrian, with some luck, may yet be able to spot the escutcheon of the city’s municipal corporation bearing the figure of the vanished hadgila, the Great Adjutant Stork, serving as a testament to the long history of localized extinctions that have been inflicted on Calcutta’s indigenous and unique ecology. The sunny, bustling town square of distant Edinburgh, another capital, gets swallowed by a labyrinthine chamber of eerie, interconnected, underground passages with street history exposing, quite literally, the city’s former underbelly of horrors such as bonded labour and crime, chronicled brilliantly by Jan-Andrew Henderson in The Town Below the Ground. The bustle of commerce and consumption around Tokyo’s Nihonbashi Bridge can, suddenly, give way to the quietness and the aroma of incense that are distinct to old shrines that dot Japan’s cities. Provincial capitals are not immune to history’s predations on the senses. Neither is history’s prick always benign. Some hours along a glistening road from Ahmedabad will lead you to the fallen minaret of a mosque near the village of Delol, a stark reminder of a recent, scarring past. History’s hide-and-seek on streets can open up intriguing lines of conjecture. Are acts of commemoration through the problematic instrument of urban redesign — the dotting of space with memorials, the renaming of vistas, the bullish push in favour of ‘national’ monuments — ahistorical in character? This is not implausible, since many of these spatial interventions are meant to function as anti-mnemonic measures, targeted to erase epochs that do not resonate with the ideology of political dispensations. Again, History’s Wars, it is often imagined, take place within secret chambers peopled by ill-informed ideologues lopping off passages from textbooks. This is not always the case. The battles within, and against, history are public, even playful, episodes, unfolding in familiar neighbourhoods, nooks and corners, turning them — such as Delhi’s Rajpath — unrecognizable.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/page-60

28-07-2021||Jharkhand||On National Justice Day, students and teachers promise to carry forward Father Stan Swamy's legacy||Abhivyakti hamara adhikar hai; Samvidhan hi hamara aadhar hai; Prjatantra ko bachao; Justice is truth in action; One voice can be muffled not millions; A right delayed is a right denied; Our constitution begins with we the people and not us the government. A host of such slogans were raised as the members of Society of Jesuits on Wednesday observed National Justice Day at De Nobili School Bhuli to pay respect to tribal rights activist, Father Stan Swamy and resolved to carry forward his legacy. The half an hour programme held near the main gate of De Nobili School Bhuli  during the morning was part of a nationwide programme organised as per the call of Jesuit Provincial of South Asia, Jesuit Conference of India and Jesuits in Goa. Talking to the Telegraph Online on Wednesday after the programme, Father Sebastian Puthepura, Principal of De Nobili School Bhuli said, “Only members of the school management, some teachers and a few of our support staff took part in the programme held in the morning during which we put a portrait of Fr Stan Swamy near the main gate and observed two minute silence in respect of Fr Stan Swamy. He added that the participants of the programme were holding placards and posters bearing slogans demanding justice for Stan Swamy. De Nobili Group of Schools situated at Digwadih, CMRI, Bhuli, Maithon, Mugma, Gomoh, Koradih, Sijua and Chandrapura are operated by the Society of Jesuits. Talking to The Telegraph Online, Puthepura said, “Stan’s death is not an end; it is yet another moment of awakening in our journey to affirm our faith in the constitution of our country.” “Stan has joined the company of Adivasi martyrs and all those who sacrificed their lives to protect the secular and democratic fabric of diverse cultures of our nation,” said Puthenpura. “Stan’s death is a moment of deep consolation, as he has united people across cultures, religions and nationalities to walk bodly and courageously in path of justice to human family and creation,” further added Puthenpura. “At this moment we profoundly acknowledge and affirm his prophetic spirit that urges us to demand justice for stand and all other accused in Bhima Koregaon case,” said a press release issued by the Jesuit conference of India released during the programme held in the school. “Insistently we ask the central government to free the human right defenders and undertrial prisoners languishing in jails in appalling conditions and above all to defend democracy, to repeal sedition law, unlawful Atrocities (Prevention) Act and repressive state laws and to restore citizens rights of dissent,” further stated the release.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-91
28-07-2021||Jharkhand||Jharkhand may escape ravages of third wave, say experts with note of caution ||With more than half the adult population likely to receive at least one vaccine dose by October and many residents naturally developing antibodies due to exposure to the virus, Jharkhand may develop herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 by the time a potential third wave hits the state, health experts closely monitoring trends have said. Jharkhand has so far vaccinated over 90 lakh residents against Covid-19, and if the immunisation drive continues at the same pace, then at least 1.5 crore of the 2.6 crore adults in the state would have the protection of at least one dose of vaccine by October, said Dr Ajay Kumar Singh, the state coordinator of Indian Medical Association (IMA). “If the vaccination pace continues at the same pace, then we will have at least half the adult population protected against Covid-19. If Covid-appropriate behavior is followed and people are cautious, then the third wave may not even affect Jharkhand at all,” said Singh. While Jharkhand has been strengthening the health infrastructure, especially focusing on the needs of children, the Indian Academy of Peadiatrics (IAP) has said that though children remain susceptible to infection, it was highly unlikely that the third wave will predominantly or exclusively affect children. It also said that there was no evidence to suggest that most children with Covid-19 infection will have severe disease in the third wave. Dr. Prabhat Kumar, the coordinator of the Covid-19 task force at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), said that the severity of symptoms was also gradually dropping with a drop in cases in the state, and a third wave may not have a major impact if Covid protocols were followed. On Wednesday, only two Covid patients were undergoing treatment in the Covid ward of Jharkhand’s largest state-run hospital. The fourth sero survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in June found that 61.2 per cent of the population surveyed in three districts of Jharkhand – Pakur, Latehar and Simdega – had Covid antibodies. As per ICMR, of the 1,231 people tested, 753 were found to have antibodies against Covid-19. Dr Kumar, however, said that the government should continue with the current restrictions in order to avert a third wave. “Despite several citizens developing antibodies to fight the virus, Covid restrictions will have to be followed strictly in order to stop the virus from mutating any further and getting stronger,” he said. There are no major festivals that may encourage mass gatherings in the state in the next two months, which may help Jharkhand keep cases under check, said Dr Singh of IMA. “We may also get vaccines for children soon, so the situation can be controlled,” he said. As per government data, as many as 3,47,002 Jharkhand residents have been infected by the coronavirus so far and 5,125 of them could not survive. The state reported at least thrice as many cases in the second wave as in the first one.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-91
28-07-2021||Jharkhand||Jharkhand news digest: Dhanbad district judge killed in road accident ||Dhanbad: The tragic death of Justice Uttam Anand, Additional District and Session Judge (VIII) of Dhanbad, took place during a road accident on Wednesday morning. The incident took place near Golf Ground less than 500 meter from his house at Judge Colony of Hirapur, when he was out for his daily morning walk during which, an unidentified four wheeler hit him. A passerby Pawan Pandey who witnessed the judge lying in a pool of blood rushed him to Sahid Nirmal Mahto Memorial Medical College and Hospital where he died during the course of treatment. The body remained unidentified in the hospital for some time and a few people suspected the body to be of a policeman after which office bearers of the Police Men’s Association also reached at the SNMMCH but could not identify as any of its members. Family members of the deceased Judge meanwhile raised an alarm at around 7 am when he didn’t return home and informed the police. Police later launched a search for the judge and as per the information provided by police family members and staff deputed at the house of Anand reached SNMMCH where his body guard identified his dead body. A High level team of police led by City SP, R Ramkumar who also reached at the site of incident and collected some evidence from the site and photography and videography of incident site was also carried out as part of investigation into the death. The murder case of Ranjay Singh, close aide of Jharia MLA Sanjeev Singh was pending in his court and Justice Anand had recently rejected the bail petitions of two members of Aman Singh’s gang, a notorious criminal of Uttar Pradesh. Senior civil lawyer of Dhanbad Swapan Mukherjee in his message on social media said,“Shocked and deeply pained to learn about the tragic and premature death of Sri Uttam Anand, District Judge of Dhanbad. I, on behalf of Bar Association Dhanbad condole his death.” (Praduman Choubey) Dhanbad: A CCTV footage showing an autorickshaw intentionally hitting Justice Uttam Anand, additional district and Session Judge of Dhanbad, from behind on a deserted road has raised doubts over his death on Wednesday morning while he was on his morning walk schedule. Bansidhar Tiwari District and Session judge of Sahebganj who is also the secretary of Jharkhand Judicial Service Association on Wednesday demanded Jharkhand High Court conduct a high level probe into the incident as the CCTV footage clearly indicated some foul play  behind his death. Hemant Sikarwal, member of Jharkhand Bar Council, termed the incident as intentional murder of a seating judge and demanded a CBI probe into the incident. In a related development, Health and Family Welfare Minister Banna Gupta on Wednesday also sought a report in connection with the death of Justice Uttam Anand from Dhanbad Deputy Commissioner Sadeep Kumar and Senior Superintendent of Police, Sanjeev Kumar. (Praduman Choubey) Daltonganj: A pressure swing adsorption medical oxygen generation plant has been installed at the sub divisional hospital in Hussainabad, 82 km away from Daltonganj. A similar pressure swing adsorption medical oxygen generation plant is yet to be installed in the Daltonganj based Medinirai medical college hospital here said sources. Sources said the installation of the plant in the Medinirai medical college hospital in Daltonganj may take a fortnight or so. The pressure swing adsorption medical oxygen generation plant has been provided from the PM Cares Fund which is yet to arrive here said the medical superintendent Dr K.N. Singh. Civil surgeon Palamau, Anil Kumar Singh, said, “Production of medical oxygen at Hussainabad may take some time but we are sanguine this sub divisional hospital here in Hussainabad will be able to cope with the oxygen need if and when the third wave strikes here.” (Our Correspondent)||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-91

28-07-2021||Jharkhand||Ranchi Archdiocese of the Catholic Church refutes 'fake news'||Ranchi Archdiocese of the Catholic Church refuted “fake news” by certain electronic channels along with people “bent on creating hatred against Christian community” by spreading rumours of a church built on government school land in Ranchi. Bishop of Khunti Binay Kandulna and Ranchi auxiliary Bishop, Theodore Mascarenhas speaking to the media, expressed hurt at the “fake news” about Catholic church building a church on the land belonging to government school in Sarangloya village under Lapung block of Ranchi. “A certain prominent news channel along with people of a certain shade have gone on an overdrive to spread fake news creating hatred and suspicion against Church and Christian in building a church on land belonging to government school. Both of us visited the school, met with people and ascertained the facts and found the news as false and malafide,” said Bishop Theodore Mascarenhas. The Bishop further said that the Roman Catholic Mission School as it is called was founded in 1936 by a few Catholics with the name of St. Joseph’s school and actually began functioning in a small church building. In 1962, some years after zamindari came to an end 24 Catholic families together bought 35 acres of land for themselves. It is on this land owned by these families that the present school building was built because the families wanted the Church to teach their children. “It may be reminded that the families are the sole owners of the land and only they decide what they wish to have on their land. In the course of time they handed over this school under the care of Fathers. In 2018, the villagers along with the Claretian Fathers decided that they needed a multipurpose hall. Therefore, with the support of the Fathers and contributions and hard labour of the villagers who wanted a place to pray, a multipurpose hall was built,” added Bishop Mascarenhas. When the number of students in the school began increasing considerably and grew from 27 to 75 and then to 220, the multipurpose hall began to be utilised also as classrooms for the children from Class 1 to V on its rolls. “The R.C. Mission School, Sarangloya is a privately owned minority school recognised by the government and it is founded and run by the Catholic church and its people for the welfare of all communities and it is not a government school as claimed by the news channel,” said Bishop Mascarenhas. It was also mentioned that the Catholic Church has been bearing all the costs of running the school. The multipurpose hall in which classes are held on week days and where prayer will be held on Sundays is built on land belonging to the Catholics and is fully in their possession. The Bishop also said that they reserve right to legal remedies if the videos being circulated by the news channels are not withdrawn.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/page-91
