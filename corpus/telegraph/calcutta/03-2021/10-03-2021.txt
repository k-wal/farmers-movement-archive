Railways officials said around 700 passenger reservation counters or points used by passengers to reserve seats were stalled because of the fire in the 14-storied building. Unreserved ticketing systems, including local trains, were also affected, alleged many passengers. Railway officials said most passenger reservation counters started functioning by Tuesday noon but those in the Sealdah division were stalled till the evening. The servers in the New Koilaghat building are used by six zonal railways for their online as well as offline ticket reservations. They are Eastern Railway, South Eastern Railway, Northeast Frontier Railway, South Central Railway, East Central Railway and East Coast Railway. Eastern Railway officials said the fire broke out in the telecom department construction office on the 13th floor and later spread across the floor and to the floor below. Though the servers are located on the second floor, the power supply to the building was cut on the advice of the fire brigade. Initially both online booking — done through the website of the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) — and offline booking done at the reservation counters in stations and other places were affected. While the railways managed to restart the online booking through the IRCTC website early on Tuesday, the reservation counters in some stations did not work for long. “We have our data recovery server or back-up server in Secunderabad. We managed to begin the online booking through that server. Many reservation counters had also opened by Tuesday morning,” said a senior railways official. But in Calcutta, the passenger reservation counters in Sealdah started working only from 6.40 pm on Tuesday. The reservation counters in Howrah station did not work in the morning and came to life only around noon. “We managed to start the reservation counters at Howrah station around noon. and the counters in Sealdah in the evening. We have also written to the fire brigade to allow us restore power supply to the reservation servers,” said Kamal Deo Das, the spokesperson of Eastern Railway. The New Koilaghat building belongs to the Eastern Railway. Long queues outside ticket counters of railway stations on the suburban railway network in Sealdah and Howrah divisions were seen on Tuesday. “I had to wait for over 45 minutes at the ticket counter at Sodepur station in the morning,” said Satyajit Roy, a resident of HB Town in Sodepur. “I realised it won’t be possible to make it on time for an appointment that was fixed with one of my clients. I decided to postpone it for another day and returned home.” At several stations including Khardah, Agarpara and Belgharia, passengers either missed their schedules for the day or boarded trains later than usual. Eastern Railway officials, however, said unreserved ticketing system was not affected. The shutdown of the counters left many passengers of long-distance trains in trouble. Kishan Goyal, a resident of Siliguri who had come to Calcutta for work, needed two tickets to return to north Bengal. Goyal looked worried as he stood outside the reservation counter in Sealdah on Tuesday afternoon. “I need two tickets on Tuesday. I tried to book the Tatkal tickets online but failed. At the Sealdah station, no one could tell me when the reservation tickets will be sold again,” he said. Later Goyal called up his brother in Kalimpong who managed to buy him two tickets online for a night train to New Jalpaiguri. Das said that the counters in Howrah and Sealdah could not work from morning since the cables connecting stations ran though the New Koilaghat building and it took time to route them through a remote location. The inconvenience would have been more if all trains were running. What helped was that the number of long-distance trains running is still about 75 or 80 per cent of all trains. The reduced service is because of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-118
10-03-2021||Calcutta||Flash of flames greeted victims, says forensic scientist||A sudden flash of fire leaping out in search of oxygen when the lift door carrying the men from the ground floor opened at the fire-hit floor and abundance of carbon monoxide in the air is likely to have resulted in the death of the nine persons at New Koilaghat Building, a forensic scientist said on Tuesday. The scientist The Telegraph spoke to spent several hours at the railways’ Strand Road office on Tuesday. He said the fire on the 13th floor on Monday night, which later spread to the floor below, was in want of oxygen as it was consuming all that was available in the ambient air. When a lift moves up it drags along with it a column of air, he said. “When the lift opened it provided a fresh oxygen. As the door opened, flames gushed towards the oxygen source,” he said. The victims were not charred to death. They were scorched, he pointed out. “When a body is charred, there are cracks on the skin and yellowish fat below it is visible from outside. In case of scorching, patches of hair, eye brows get burnt and the face gets distorted following exposure to severe flow of heat and flames,” the scientist said. “In case of scorching, parts of skin that are touched while removing the body may come off making it difficult to identify the victims at times.” What possibly hastened the death for some was the presence of carbon monoxide on the air, the forensic scientist, who was a part of a team that visited the fire-hit building and spent over four hours collecting samples, including electrical wires, said. The team also spoke to police officers at the spot. When fire strikes on top floors of a high-rise it rapidly starts consuming the oxygen available. As a result, a portion of an elevator’s shaft gradually starts getting filled with carbon monoxide. While examining the floors, the forensic team found several items that were not completely burnt, including computers and plastic items. This suggests oxygen shortage and presence of carbon monoxide. Preliminary post mortem reports suggest the victims had suffered cardiac arrest following severe dehydration due to burns.  At least two victims had died of asphyxia, the report suggests. “Carbon monoxide can result in asphyxial death, something that we had observed in case of the victims of the fire that broke out at AMRI Hospital in 2011,” the scientist said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-119
10-03-2021||Calcutta||New Koilaghat building fire: FIR against ‘responsible authority’||The New Koilaghat building that housed several railway offices and servers for ticketing across several parts of India lacked a fire certificate even after the state fire and emergency services department had notified some shortcomings following an inspection in 2015, fire department officials said. Police on Tuesday filed an FIR against the “responsible authority” for causing death due to negligence and for contravention of provisions of fire prevention and safety norms at the Eastern Railways office in the New Koilaghat building. A fire that started there on Monday evening killed nine and injured one. Senior railway official Utpal Acharya, 58, is in the ICU of a railway hospital. His office is on the 13th floor and he scampered down to the 10th floor when the fire was reported. But he went back upstairs to put away some documents under lock and key that he had left unlocked, a relative told Metro. Acharya, a resident of Bhadreswar in Hooghly who has a history of COPD, was found in a semi-conscious state on the 13th floor and rescued with minor burns on his face. Officials in the fire and emergency services department said the building did not have basic firefighting equipment like sprinklers, hydrants, a water pump, an alternative source of power and a fire-lift, that are mandatory for highrise buildings. A senior fire department official said the building did not have a “fire certificate”, which is an NOC issued by the fire department after verifying that the building (or any establishment) has fire safety equipment as per its requirements. Reacting to the allegations, a senior official of Eastern Railway said: “All the offices have fire extinguishers. But those are meant for low intensity fires. For high intensity fire, we have to call the fire brigade.” The FIR was registered with Hare Street police station and the case has since been shifted to the detective department at Lalbazar for investigation. The charges indicate that prima facie, the police and the fire department have found violations of maintenance of fire safety norms and regulations in the building that not just has offices on 14 floors but also houses the server room for online reservation for six railway divisions across a vast swathe of India. A senior officer in Lalbazar said according to the preliminary opinion of the forensic team, the wiring of the floor was old and had decayed. “It appears that the wire covering melted because of overload and over-heating causing multiple short-circuits, including some in the server room,” the officer said. The ambit of the probe will include the cause of the fire as well as the death of the nine people. The charges slapped on the authorities of the building include non-bailable sections with a maximum punishment of five years in jail and a maximum fine amount of Rs 5 lakh. The dead include four fire department personnel, four railway personnel and one Calcutta police assistant sub-inspector. Their bodies underwent post-mortem and were handed over to their relatives. A senior official of the fire department said the authorities of the New Koilaghat building had applied for a fire NOC in 2013 following which the department had carried out an inspection and communicated a detailed list of recommendations of fire-safety measures to be implemented in the building in 2015. “There was no response from them after that,” said the senior official. Questions have also surfaced about why the main power supply of the building was not turned off as soon as the fire was reported on the 13th floor. “It was the responsibility of the competent authorities in the building to turn off the main power supply. Why should they wait for the fire brigade to come and do that?” said a senior official of the fire department who had been part of one of the firefighting teams on Monday. Nine people had died in two elevators which were still operational when the building was on fire. Seven of them were in one elevator while two were found in another. The post-mortems of all nine were conducted at SSKM hospital on Tuesday. The preliminary opinion suggested that the seven found inside and in front of one elevator had died of burns and the other two, found in another lift, had died after inhaling carbon monoxide and not from burn injuries. A senior fire department officer said they had responded within three minutes of the call and had they taken longer, the outcome “could have been worse”. The CPRO of the Eastern Railways said a “high-level enquiry” has been ordered to probe the cause of the incident and for making recommendations for necessary steps that need to be taken. Calcutta police ASI Amit Kumar Bhawal, who was on motorcycle patrol duty from Hare Street police station and one of the first to respond to the situation, was honoured with a gun salute at the Lalbazar city police headquarters. Compensation cheques of Rs 10 lakh each were handed to the relatives of the nine deceased persons by the state government.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-119
10-03-2021||Calcutta||West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education eases practical deadline||The higher secondary council has relaxed the March 31 deadline for schools to finish practical exams in view of the possibility of central forces occupying school buildings during the polls, coming in the way of wrapping up exams by the date set earlier. The earlier order of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education had asked the schools to start in-person practical exams in early March and end within March 31. Officials of the school education department said that the council had received appeals from the schools in the districts to defer the deadline. This happened after the institutions received requisition regarding forces taking possession of the school building in the run-up to the polls scheduled between March 27 and April 29 — a situation following which schools could not even start the practical exams. The CRPF are expected to enter the school buildings of a specified zone at least a week before the polls. The central force uses the buildings to set up their base before starting their patrol, conducting route marches in the run-up to the polls in a designated segment as part of precautionary measures. “Once the force takes control of the premises, the entry of teachers, school officials and students will be disallowed, ruling out the possibility of holding practical exams,” said the official. Sridam Jana, the president of the West Bengal Headmasters’ Association, said although the council gave the schools flexibility to start the exams from March 1, modifying its previous order that had fixed March 10 as the start date, several schools did not want to start the exams early without conducting the bare minimum practical classes. “Around the time they would be through with classes, the forces would knock on the door to enter. So, they are appealing for pushing back the deadline,” he said. Schools, that had closed in March last year as a precaution against Covid, reopened on February 12. One of the instrumental factors behind lifting the closure was to allow students of science streams to get some bare minimum hands-on training before writing the practical exams. “It is not only about being able to write the practical exams, the classes are a must to impart some fundamental knowledge minus which a student will flounder as he/she proceeds to the next level of study,” said a headmaster. Saugata Basu, the secretary of the government school teachers’ association, said that some schools found it difficult to start practical exams earlier because teachers were engaged in training programs for the ensuing election. “If the exams are not started on time, then they will face difficulty in ending the exams within March 31. This, too, has triggered the appeal,” said Basu. Council president Mahua Das said: “We are not issuing any order as the appeal could be specific to an institution based in a zone. Let the schools appeal on the basis of which we will consider the issue going through the merit of the case. The council had set the dates well before the election commission came up with the dates of the eight-phased election on February 25,” she said. The council had announced the dates in late December. This year, the council has left it to the schools entirely to make arrangements for conducting the practical exams. The theory exams would be conducted by the council in June.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-119
10-03-2021||Calcutta||Fire kills fighter who joined AMRI rescue as a teen ||Nine people died in the fire that broke out at the New Koilaghat building on Monday night. Four of them were fire-fighters, four railway employees and one was an assistant sub-inspector of Calcutta Police. Another railway official who was injured, is admitted at the intensive care unit of a hospital. The Telegraph finds about the dead and the injured. Biman Purkait, 24 Worked for: West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services as an auxiliary fire operator Purkait was one of those who had jumped into the rescue of patients at the AMRI Hospital in Dhakuria after a fire broke out at the hospital in December 2011, leaving 92 dead. He was only 14 then but did not think twice before joining few others in bringing out the trapped patients. On Monday night too, Purkait didn’t think twice and was one of the first to enter the building when fire was engulfing the 13th floor, said his colleagues.  Purkait was in one of the elevators and his body was recovered along with several others. According to fire services officials, auxiliary fire operators are one of the first responders of the department, when a fire breaks out. They are contractual employees without benefits of provident fund and other perquisites. He was among those who were trying to go to the upper floors, where the fire was raging, using an elevator. Purkait lived with parents, brother and sister-in-law in their one room hutment in a slum in Dhakuria’s Panchanantala. “He is from a poor family. The family has been devastated,” said Baiswanor Chattopadhyay, the coordinator for Ward 90 of Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The young man’s Facebook profile had imprints of his kind heart. He shared pictures of children who had been lost requesting others to help their parents find the kind by giving an address. He also shared posts looking for blood donors for patients. An official of the fire brigade said he had been working with the department for three years. Amit Kumar Bhawal, 45 Worked for: Calcutta Police as assistant sub-inspector Bhawal, an assistant sub-inspector with the Hare Street police station, was on patrol on a motorbike when he heard about the fire. He went inside the building to assess the gravity of the fire and report it to his seniors. The feedback would have been important to assess the response required. But when Bhawal did not come down, his colleagues became worried. “He died while trying to ensure that others were safe or that the fire did not go out of control,” a police officer said. A colleague had tried to dissuade Bhawal from going inside, but he said he would go inside and assess the scale of the fire. “He went inside around 6.10pm. When I called him around 6.50pm, I could not connect,” said the colleague. Long after, his body was found in one of the elevators inside the building. Bhawal’s body was taken to Lalbazar, the headquarters of the Calcutta Police, on Tuesday afternoon. Police commissioner Soumen Mitra and several other officers paid tribute to him. The police also gave him a gun salute. Girish Dey, 40 Worked for: West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services as a sub-officer Dey, a sub-officer of fire brigade, was placed with the Lalbazar fire station. It was among those fire stations whose personnel were among the first to reach the New Koilaghat building on Monday. “He was a very bright officer, never afraid of anything,” said a retired fire brigade officer who had worked with Dey. Dey had completed his graduate fire engineering training from Delhi, said the retired officer. Dey’s father is a retired police officer, he said. Fire brigade officers said Dey would have risen up the ranks and reached among the senior officers of the department. He was also learning the nitty-gritty about issuing fire safety certificates and would have received the authority to inspect structures and issue fire safety certificates in another couple of years. The fire brigade officer was supposed to go on a family vacation with his wife and son on Tuesday. Partha Sarathi Mondal, 59 Worked for: Eastern Railway as deputy-chief commercial manager A resident of Sremani Para in Baranagar, Mondal used to live with his ailing wife since the time their only daughter was married off. His office was on the fourth floor. On Monday he spotted the flames after he came out of the building after work. He decided to return to retrieve some documents, said one of his colleagues. Family members have learnt from his colleagues that on his way to the ground floor, after the retrieving the documents, Mondal had taken a lift which instead of going to the ground floor, first went up to the 13th floor. Partha died of asphyxia, railway officials said. Late on Monday, Mondal’s son-in-law rushed to Strand Road and had even inquired about him with chief minister Mamata Banerjee. The CM was seen consoling him. Neither the police nor the fire department officials could then provide him any information about his father-in-law. The news of his death reached the family much later after his body was identified at SSKM morgue. Sanjay Sahani, 36 Worked for: Railway Protection Force (RPF) as a constable A resident of Manishpur in Vaishali district of Bihar, Sahani was a RPF personnel and his colleagues recalled him as a young and jovial person who stayed in his railway quarters with his nephew. Sahani was accompanying Partha Sarathi Mondal as his security and had joined his boss on scurrying upstairs from the ground floor when they saw the fire on Monday evening. The two had secured some files and were on their way to the ground floor. The lift that Sahani and Mondal used moved to the fire-hit 13th floor, instead of going to the ground floor. Sahani died with Partha in the lift. “I got the information this morning from one of his colleagues,” said one of Sahani’s  brothers who reached the fire-site on Tuesday afternoon. Aniruddha Jana, 29 Worked for: West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services as an auxiliary fire officer Jana had joined the department three years back. He was part of a team of firefighters from the headquarters to have rushed to the Strand Road building. He is survived by father Mohan Lala Jana and his sister who got married a month back, said his colleagues. Jana himself was supposed to tie the knot in the next couple of months. He had received the best firefighter reward from the department last year for exemplary courage during the Bagri Market fire as well as the one that broke out at the Jaanbazar Market, a senior fire officer said. An avid follower of sports, he would always request his seniors or co-firefighters to switch to the sports channels on the television in the fire station whenever a cricket or football match was on. One of his family members said that he was fond of travelling and was planning a trip to Darjeeling in April. Sudip Das, 57 Worked for: Eastern Railway as senior technician in the signal and telecommunication department The Howrah resident had returned home on his motorbike after signing out of his office around 5.10pm on Tuesday. After a brief stay at his Benaras Road home in Kona, Das had gone to meet his mother at her Dasnagar house in Howrah, who had recently undergone an eye surgery. He then received a call from one of his colleagues informing him about the fire and requested him to return, said one of his colleagues. Das had keys to some of the office doors. Over the next four hours, his family members and friends kept calling him on his mobile phone but the calls remained unanswered. Some of his colleagues feared his death since they had spotted his motorbike lying at the parking lot of the Strand Road building, but he wasn’t taking any calls. Late in the night, the family was informed that Das had passed away. “We had requested the police to check his mobile location because it was difficult to identify him. His face was badly burnt,” said one of Das’s friends. Shrawan Pandey, 56 Worked for: Eastern Railway as a senior commercial clerk Pandey was about to leave for his home in Sealdah when the news of fire reached him. He scurried down to the ground floor and noticed some firefighters and police trying to find a way to reach the seat of fire. According to Pandey’s colleagues, he told the fire-fighters that they must reach the spot as early as possible since several servers were located at the top of the building where the fire was raging. Pandey’s colleagues said he then joined a team of fire-fighters and police who were trying to reach the seat of fire and received severe burns that caused his death. Gourab Bej, 35 Worked for: West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services as an auxiliary fire officer Bej had finished his fire training course in 2013 and joined the West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services as an auxiliary fire officer. He was attached with the Lalbazar fire station. He was a resident of Garfa. He was one of the first responders of the New Koilaghat Building fire. He was in the second fire engine, one of his colleagues said.

Bej was also part of a team that had cleared roads and streets of areas including Esplanade, Park Street of trees that had been uprooted during Cyclone Amphan. He was also part of a team that carried out a fire inspection at The 42, a colleague said. According to another colleague, Bej had a weakness for betel leaves and would always carry around ten betel leaves in his pocket and pop one before heading out to a fire call. His fondness for fish curry is also well-known among his co-workers and he would often cook for them too.

10-03-2021||Calcutta||One more arrested in cocaine case||A woman named Amrita Singh has been arrested for allegedly procuring and supplying the cocaine to BJP leader Rakesh Singh that was apparently found in BJP youth leader Pamela Goswami’s car on February 19. Police sources said Amrita’s estranged husband S. Agarwal had sent an email to Lalbazar two days before Goswami’s arrest informing them that Rakesh Singh was trying to frame a woman in a narcotics case. The police said such emails naming people were common and often turn out to be fake and the outcome of personal vendetta. Police officers starting taking the email seriously only after Rakesh’s name emerged in the cocaine case soon after Goswami’s arrest on February 19. The police had contacted Agarwal and got his statement recorded before the magistrate. Amrita’s alleged role in the cocaine case became evident when the police purportedly spotted her presence near Rakesh’s house through CCTV footage a few days before Goswami’s arrest. The police said Amrita had allegedly procured cocaine for Rs 9,500 per gram with funds provided by Rakesh. She has been booked under sections of the narcotics drugs and psychotropic substances act, in connection with the same case for which Goswami and Rakesh were earlier arrested. “After buying the cocaine, she had handed it to Rakesh. There is CCTV footage to corroborate her visit to Rakesh’s home before the Goswami incident,” said an officer. Amrita, alias Sweety, was arrested in a rented flat in a New Town housing complex on Monday and produced at Alipore NDPS court on Tuesday. The police has found that Amrita had met Rakesh a few years ago for a work-related matter. Amrita’s lawyers submitted in the court that she had no connection with the cocaine case. “My client had gone to a shopping mall with her son when she was picked up,” her defence lawyer said. The police submitted a prayer before the court to allow them to examine Rakesh in jail where he is lodged at present.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-119
10-03-2021||Calcutta||Nothing left of 40 years of hard work, recalls an official of Strand Road railway office||A senior railway official who has his office on the 13th floor of New Koilaghat building on Strand Road recalled the moment he saw fire in one of the rooms on the same floor. The flames gradually engulfed everything, including files he had been maintaining for the last four decades. The official, who was reluctant to be named, has been working in the same building for the last 40 years. He narrated to The Telegraph the last minutes he spent at the signal and telecom department office of the Eastern Railways before he was forced to leave and run on Monday night. Someone raised the alarm that there was a fire on our floor. There was something frantic about the cries of “fire, fire”. I saw some of my colleagues and RPF men rushing towards the room where the fire was reported. It was the laboratory where our communication devices and electronic equipment are repaired. There was panic everywhere. People were running, mostly rushing out of the office. My instinct was also to run. But what will happen to all these files that I have created with so much of hard work and dedication? I decided against my instincts and started to wrap the files which were kept open on my table. In the meantime, the commotion increased. I saw RPF men use extinguishers. But the fire was still raging. I made haste. By the time I packed everything into the cupboard and locked it to my satisfaction, the smoke had reached me. Some of my colleagues and I started out on the staircase. The flight of stairs was directly below the room that had caught fire. The staircase was also getting filled with smoke by then. I had walked down the flight of stairs so many times in the past. But yesterday was so different. As smoke was fast filling this staircase and there were so many people trying to get down, on reaching the 10th floor, I availed of another staircase that took me to the rear part of the building. Some of my colleagues and I were out in the open, thanking our lucky stars that we managed to come out unhurt. Just then, I glanced up and saw that flames were raging out of the windows on the floor that had been my office for so many years now. It was a shocking sight. The flames had grown so suddenly. I also realised how close I had been to getting trapped had I not moved on time. I searched for my friends and colleagues. One of them who had started with us, had apparently gone up again, I learned. He was rescued sometime later with facial burns. As I started for home, shocked with the sudden development in the last one hour, the only consolation I had was that I had kept all my files safely in the cupboard. As I reached home, I saw on television the fire had spread across the floor. My heart sank. Today I have realised that nothing is left. All the hours I had put in to create the files are gone forever. I have nothing much to look forward to. For me, it is a personal loss. Maybe it was the evening Ganges breeze that we had been enjoying on the 13th floor that engulfed our office last night.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-119
10-03-2021||Calcutta||IIM calls for applications for new director||Indian Institute of Management Calcutta has called for applications for a new director who, an advertisement says, “is expected to provide strong academic leadership”. The present director, Anju Seth, will complete 65 years in January 2022 and the IIM Act, 2017, sets the age of director’s superannuation at 65. Seth had relocated from the US and joined the institute in August 2018. An official of the institute said the search has begun early so that “adequate time could be given to screen candidates”. Those interested to apply have been asked to send their CV to the chairperson, search- cum-selection committee. The advertisement says: “IIMC seeks to appoint a director to lead the institute in maintaining and extending its edge among peers and building higher visibility globally through greater collaboration with academia and industry.” Last year, several teachers of the B-school had written to the Centre and the institute’s board of governors twice, accusing the present director of lacking leadership quality, eroding the autonomy of the institute’s academic council and conceding space to peers like IIM-Ahmedabad and IIM-Bangalore. “Especially in light of the autonomy resulting from the IIM Act, the individual will also be responsible for fund raising and creating endowment,” the advertisement says.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/calcutta/page-119
