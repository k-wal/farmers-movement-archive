The chamber's President Sanjay Aggarwal said "the 36 days farm agitation so far will have more than Rs 70,000 crore economic loss in the Q3 FY 2020-21 due to...disruption in supply chains and day-to-day economic activities particularly in the progressive states of Punjab and Haryana and border areas of National capital Delhi." The consensus reached between the government and farmers on two points -- penalties for stubble burning and Electricity Amendment Bill, 2020 -- is highly appreciable and the chamber looks forward to an early resolution of the remaining two issues as well, he added. Talks between the farmers and the Centre remain deadlocked over the main contentious issues of the repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP. There are around 25 lakh MSMEs in Punjab and Haryana which employ more than 45 lakh workers contributing more than Rs 4 lakh crore in the total Rs 14 lakh crore GSDP (current prices) of Punjab and Haryana. The GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) of Punjab and Haryana was estimated at Rs 5.75 lakh crore and Rs 8.31 lakh crore respectively in 2019-20, Aggarwal said. Sectors such as food processing, cotton textiles, garments, automobile, farm machinery, information technology, trading, tourism, hospitality and transport have been severely impacted by the agitation which has disrupted supplies of many raw materials to the industry, he added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-185

On-net domestic voice calls have always been free on the Jio network," it added. Put simply, off-net calls refer to calls that terminate in other networks. Over the last year or so, Reliance Jio was charging customers 6 paise per minute for voice calls made to rival phone networks, but compensated subscribers by giving free data of equal value.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-185

The Indians banks, vendors and other creditors have made claims of around Rs 86,000 crore on the company which is at present going through insolvency proceedings. “According to figures certified by the resolution professional appointed by the lenders, the R-Com group owed around Rs 26,000 crore to Indian banks and financial institutions as on the date of filing before the NCLT,” Reliance Communications (R-Com) said in a statement. The creditors have submitted claims of around Rs 49,000 crore on R-Com, Rs 24,000 crore on Reliance Telecom and Rs 12,600 crore on Reliance Infratel before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). “The alleged ‘fraud’ classification by certain banks is entirely unjustified and the Delhi High Court by an interim order has directed the same to be kept in abeyance for the time being, and the matter is now sub judice,” R-Com said. It further said that the resolution plans are at various stages of approval before the NCLT and the lenders are likely to recover at least 70 per cent of their dues. “The financial stress in the telecom sector, owing inter alia to the entry of a new player in 2016 with unlimited free offerings, was not unique to R-Com, but decimated the entire industry,” it said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-185
31-12-2020||Business||Life insurance premium growth to be flat||The life insurance industry is expected to see a flat growth in annual premium equivalent in the ongoing fiscal. The industry was affected by a staggered lockdown disrupting the physical sales channel, weakness in the capital markets, focus on cash conservation and moderation in the protection business along with the pressure of a premium hike dampening the pace of recovery. The annual premium equivalent (APE) refers to 100 per cent regular premium and 10 per cent of the single premium collected by an insurer in a given period. It is used to normalise single-premium payments and recurring premium payment to accurately compare sales. On an APE basis, the industry saw a decline of 9 per cent for a five-month period ending August 2020 and 7 per cent decline at the end of September 2020. Individual new business premium at Rs 46,839 crore saw a modest 1 per cent growth on a year-on-year basis as of September 2020. “We expect the full-year industry growth to be flattish or slightly positive,” said G. Murlidhar, managing director  and chief executive officer of Kotak Life Insurance. Growth drivers The industry, however, is bullish on the growth prospects with protection plans and annuities to act as the two main drivers on the product side. The industry anticipates a 15 per cent compounded annual growth rate in insurance premium over the next 5 years. According to Kotak Life Insurance, the key factors driving this are increasing customer awareness, preference for transactions through digital platforms, favourable demography and an under-penetrated market. Protection plans are expected to grow at a CAGR of 23-25 per cent, while annuities are expected to grow at over 20 per cent. “In both the segments, the growth rate would be faster than the industry average,” said Murlidhar. “We expect the industry growth momentum to continue in 2021 with people becoming cognizant of the need for insurance. From a product perspective, while term and health plans saw an uptick, we will have to see how the next few months pan out with respect to the new strain of the virus and vaccine. If the news stays positive, I am sure market linked products would also come back in a big way,” said Tarun Chugh, MD and CEO of Bajaj Allianz Life.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-185

The minister said the government was targeting to more than double the blending of ethanol in petrol to 20 per cent by 2030, for which domestic capacity has to be augmented. India will need about 1,000 crore litres of ethanol for doping in petrol by 2030 against the current capacity of 684 crore litres. He added that the cabinet has approved a modified scheme to enhance ethanol distillation capacity in the country for producing first-generation ethanol from feed stocks such as cereals (rice, wheat, barley, corn and sorghum), sugarcane and sugar beet. The government would bear interest subvention for five years, including a one-year moratorium against the loan availed by project proponents from banks, at the rate of 6 per cent per annum or 50 per cent of the rate of interest charged by banks, whichever is lower. Paradip go-ahead The government has also approved a Rs 3,000-crore project to turn Paradip Port into a world-class port by setting up a dock. The Paradip port handles about 115 million tonnes (mt) of cargo  which is likely to increase substantially to about 400mt by 2030.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-185

These two arms of Reliance Industries accounted for 25 per cent of the value, a PwC India tabulation has shown. If it was not for the multiple transactions in these two entities, the numbers for 2020 would have looked tepid. However, experts feel that the trend is likely to continue as consolidation is expected to drive M&A activity in India. While initially deal activity was affected because of the Covid-19 pandemic, it received a boost after Jio Platforms garnered over $16 billion (Rs 1,18,318 crore) by selling a 25.24 per cent stake and Reliance Retail saw $6.4 billion (Rs 47,265 crore) of investments as it divested around 9 per cent shareholding. Together, they accounted for over 25 per cent of the $80-billion deal activity witnessed across 1,260 transactions. According to PwC India report titled, “Deals in India: Annual review and outlook for 2021”, the total deals in value terms showed a 7 per cent increase compared with last year. The report added that 2020 recorded 17 deals in the billion-dollar bracket, which was double the number of such deals (9) recorded in 2019. Ajay Arora, partner and national leader of investment banking, at EY India told PTI that the first half of this calendar year saw a major decline in M&As but in the second half, it saw a strong bounce back when deals rose nearly 40 per cent. “I expect this strong momentum to continue in 2021, primarily driven by a significant appetite of PEs for buyouts and an uptick in inbound deals,” he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-186

The directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) has also extended the suspension of all international flight operations in the country till January 31, 2021. The civil aviation ministry had last week suspended all flights between the European country and India from December 23-31 as a mutated variant of the coronavirus was detected there. The minister tweeted: “Decision has been taken to extend the temporary suspension of flights to and from the UK till January 7, 2021. Thereafter strictly regulated resumption will take place for which details will be announced shortly,” he said. Puri’s announcement has come following a recommendation by the Union health ministry to extend the suspension. The presence of the new UK variant of the virus has already been reported by Denmark, Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada and Japan. More than 30 countries have suspended air links with Britain over the new strain. After a gap of two months, the domestic flight operations resumed in May. International services are being operated under air bubble pacts with different countries. The minister tweeted: “Decision has been taken to extend the temporary suspension of flights to and from the UK till 7 January 2021. Thereafter strictly regulated resumption will take place for which details will be announced shortly,” he said. Meanwhile, the DGCA extended the suspension of all international flight operations in the country till 31 January, 2021.  "Govt of India extends suspension of scheduled commercial international flights till 31 Jan, 2021," said the civil aviation regulator. However, the restrictions will not be applicable on international air cargo operations and flights specially approved by DGCA.

The last date for entities and individuals who have to  submit audited accounts have been extended to February 15 from January 31. The finance ministry announcement relates to filing returns for financial year 2019-20 or assessment year 2020-21. The move comes amid requests from various associations and netizens calling for an extension of the dates. “Considering the problems faced by various taxpayers, it has been decided to provide further time to the taxpayers for furnishing income tax returns, tax audit reports and declaration under the Vivad Se Vishwas scheme,” the finance ministry said.. “Further, to provide more time to taxpayers to comply under various ongoing proceedings, the dates of completion of proceedings under various direct taxes and benami acts have also been extended,” the ministry said . For individual taxpayers who are required to get their accounts audited and companies, the due date for filing returns is now pushed to February 15, 2021. Such returns were initially scheduled for submission by October 31, 2020. It was subsequently extended to November 30, 2020 and later to January 31, 2021. For taxpayers who are required to furnish reports in respect of international/specified domestic transactions, the due date has been extended to February 15, 2021 against the January 31, 2021 deadline. For all other individual taxpayers, the due date has been extended to January 10, 2021. Originally scheduled for July 31, 2020, the due date was extended twice — first to November 30, 2020 and then to December 31, 2020. Audit reports The finance ministry also extended the date of furnishing various audit reports, including tax audit reports and reports in respect of international/specified domestic transactions, for assessment year 2020-21 to January 15, 2021. The last date for making declaration under the Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme has also been extended to January 31, 2021 from December 31, 2020. “The  extension may not be adequate. This should be reviewed and extended further,” said Narayan Jain, chairman, representation committee, Direct Taxes Professionals’ Association. According to tax practitioners, the staff of advocates and chartered accounts dealing with audit and tax matters were unable to come to work frequently because of the pandemic. This made it difficult to complete compliance related work within the due date. “Although the government has given an extension, it may not be adequate. This should be reviewed and extended further,” said Narayan Jain, chairman, representation committee, Direct Taxes Professionals’ Association. The ministry has also extended the due date for payment of self assessment tax for “small and middle class” taxpayers whose liability is up to Rs 1 lakh to February 15, 2021. For taxpayers who need not get their accounts audited, the self assessment tax due date is January 10, 2021. The government has also extended the due date of furnishing of annual return under section 44 of Central Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017 for FY 2019-20 from December 31, 2020 to February 28, 2021.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-186
31-12-2020||Business||Reliance-BP alters gas price terms||The consortium of Reliance Industries and BP on Wednesday invited bids for gas it plans to produce from the second-wave discoveries in the KG-D6 block, pricing them for the very first time against JKM or Japan/Korea Liquefied Natural Gas Import Price, an international gas benchmark. “The gas produced for KG-D6 will be available for sale at the delivery point at Gadimoga near Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh tentatively from 01 February 2021,” the companies said in a notice. The e-bidding would take place on January 22, the request for proposal said. Reliance-BP had in November 2019 sold the first 5 million standard cubic meters per day (mscmd) of gas from the R-Series field in the KG-D6 block. The duo has now invited bids for 7.5 mscmd of incremental output that is likely to be available from February next year, according to a notice inviting offer. They had priced the first 5mscmd  against Brent crude oil and now they are seeking rates equivalent to JKM or Japan/Korea Liquefied Natural Gas Import Price. Bidders have been asked to ”quote the variable denoted as ‘V’ in USD per million British thermal unit (mBtu) terms”. “The gas price (in $/mBtu (GCV)) shall be = JKM + V,” the notice said. GCV stands for gross calorific value. “V” can be a positive, zero or negative number and up to two decimal places but it cannot be less than (-) 0.30 $/mBtu, it said. This means users will have to quote (-) 0.30 or higher value of “V”. JKM averaged $6.20 per mBtu in November and at the base or cut off price, KG-D6 gas would cost $5.9 per mBtu. This is higher than $4.2-4.4 per mBtu rate at which the first 5mscmd were sold at Brent crude oil benchmark. Brent crude oil is presently in the range of $50-51 per barrel. This will be the first discovery of gas price since the October 2020 decision of the government setting out uniform e-bidding norms for finding the market price. The Cabinet decision in October allowed the sale of gas to “affiliates”, meaning Reliance-BP affiliate companies can now take part in the bidding. Earlier this month, RIL and its partner BP had announced the commencement of natural gas production from the second wave of discoveries in the KG-D6 fields. Asia's deepest project, putting the second wave of discoveries in the KG-D6 block onstream. The production from ultra-deepwater R-Cluster, the first of the three deepsea projects Reliance-BP are developing in the eastern offshore block, started production, the two firms said. Reliance and BP are developing three deepwater gas projects in block KG D6 – R Cluster, Satellites Cluster and MJ – which together are expected to meet about 15% of India's gas demand by 2023. "These projects will utilise the existing hub infrastructure in KG-D6 block," it said. Reliance is the operator of KG D6 with a 66.67% participating interest and BP holds a 33.33% stake. R-Cluster is the first of the three projects to come onstream. The field is located about 60 kilometres from the existing KG-D6 Control and Riser Platform (CRP) off the Kakinada coast and comprises a subsea production system tied back to CRP via a subsea pipeline. Located at a water depth of greater than 2,000 metres, it is the deepest offshore gas field in Asia. The field is expected to reach plateau gas production of about 12.9 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) in 2021.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-186
