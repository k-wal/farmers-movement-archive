The ministry has also cut down the capacity for airlines to operate from 80 per cent to 50 per cent from next month. Now, the lower limit for flights under 40 minutes of duration will be increased from Rs 2,300 to Rs 2,600 — a hike of 13 per cent. Similarly, flights with durations between 40 and 60 minutes will have a lower limit of Rs 3,300 instead of Rs 2,900, the order said. The increase in airfares will come into effect from June 1, it said. The upper limits on fares remain unchanged. The move is aimed at helping the airlines amid a devastating second wave of Covid-19 which has reduced air travel significantly.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-35
30-05-2021||Business||Bank of Baroda reports net loss of Rs 1,047 crore in Q4||Bank of Baroda (BoB) on Saturday reported a surprise loss for the fourth quarter ended March 2021 as tax provisions climbed as the state-owned lender switched to a new tax structure. During the quarter, BoB suffered a net loss of Rs 1,046.50 crore compared with a net profit of Rs 506.59 crore in the year-ago period after provisions for taxes rose to Rs 3,726.07. The lender said in its notes to accounts that while recognising provision for income tax for the year ended March 2021, it exercised the option of a lower tax rate permitted under Section 115 BAA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 as introduced by the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019. The impact of these changes was a one-time charge of Rs 3,837.20 crore that was included in its tax expenses. Excluding the impact of the change in tax regime, it would have reported a net profit of Rs 2,267 crore during the period. For the full year, the lender posted a net profit of Rs 829 crore, a jump of 52 per cent over Rs 546 crore in the preceding fiscal. During the quarter, its asset quality improved with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) coming in lower at Rs 66,670.99 crore compared with Rs 69,381.43 crore in the year-ago period. The percentage of gross NPAs came down to 8.87 per cent over Rs 9.40 per cent. For the year, its slippage ratio, or the accretion of fresh bad loans, declined to 2.71 per cent from 2.97 per cent in the previous fiscal. The bank disclosed that it has restructured 7,861 accounts under the guidelines issued by the RBI in August last year. Because of this, the increase in provisions stood at Rs 11,335 crore. During the quarter, the bank’s core income, or NII (net interest income), increased to Rs 7,107 crore from Rs 6,798 crore a year ago, a rise of 4.54 per cent.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-35
30-05-2021||Business||Jaypee Infratech decides to give more time to NBCC, Suraksha to submit final bids||Financial creditors of embattled Jaypee Infratech have decided to give more time to state-owned NBCC and Suraksha group to submit their final bids to acquire the realty firm through an insolvency process. The two-day voting process, which began on May 27, to decide whether a further extension should be given to both the contenders concluded on Friday evening. Sources said that members representing 98.54 per cent of the voting rights gave their assent to the proposal to provide a final opportunity to both the resolution applicants to submit their revised bids. The deadline for submission of the final bids is June 4 and the resolution plans should be compliant with insolvency law and a Supreme Court judgment on March 24. Over 20,000 home buyers have 56.61 per cent voting rights in the committee of creditors (CoC) and that of fixed deposit holders is 0.13 per cent, while 13 banks have 43.26 per cent voting share. At its meeting held on May 24, the CoC of Jaypee Infratech decided to defer the voting process on the Suraksha group’s bid. The panel decided to conduct voting on May 27-28 on the topic of allowing both NBCC and Suraksha to submit their final offers. NBCC had last week written a letter to interim resolution professional Anuj Jain to clarify concerns raised on the treatment of dissenting creditors.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-35
30-05-2021||Business||Group of Ministers set up to examine need for exempting GST on Covid essentials||An eight-member group of ministers has been set up to study the goods and services tax (GST) rates applicable on Covid-19-related materials, the finance ministry said on Saturday. The panel has been formed as states failed to reach an agreement on the contentious issue of fixing a zero rate of tax on all Covid-related products. The Centre refused to relent, arguing that the tax waiver issue was devilishly complicated as it would have to cover a barrel-load of items across the value chain to be really effective, ensuring that no manufacturer was denied an input tax credit just because some product was left out of the ambit. The high-powered group includes finance ministers of eight states — Meghalaya, Maharashtra, Goa, Odisha, Telangana, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Kerala. Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma, who also holds the state’s finance portfolio, is the group’s convenor. The panel will examine the need for GST concession/exemption and make recommendations on (i) Covid vaccines, drugs and medicine and testing kits; (ii) medical grade oxygen, pulse oximeters, hand sanitisers, oxygen therapy equipment such as concentrators, generators and ventilators, PPE kits, N 95 masks, surgical masks, temperature checking equipment; and (iii) any other items required for Covid relief. Most of the Covid-19-related items attract a GST of 12 per cent, except for vaccines, which attract a tax of 5 per cent. Ritesh Kanodia, partner, Dhruva Advisors LLP, said, “Whether or not vaccines should be included in the exemption list is also to be seen from the perspective of whether the exemptions will result in the passing of any effective benefit to the end consumer. As far as free vaccine distribution is concerned, the states are already bearing the cost. If an exemption is granted, they will also lose their share of revenue to the extent of such exemption. ‘‘However, the flip side is that the Center may also end up compensating the state if their revenues do not grow by 14 per cent year-on-year. Also, in terms of revenue sharing, states will further lose 42 per cent revenue from the GST collections by the Centre,’’ Kanodia added. “The panel has been directed to submit the report by June 8, but the final decision could be delayed as the date for next council meeting has not been announced,” Shweta Walecha, director at Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan Attorneys, said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-36
30-05-2021||Business||Petrol price crosses Rs 100 a litre in Mumbai||Mumbai became the first metro city in the country where the price of petrol crossed Rs 100-a-litre mark after state-owned oil firms raised fuel rates for the 15th time this month. Petrol price was increased by 26 paise per litre and diesel by 28 paise a litre, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers. The increase took petrol and diesel prices to a fresh all-time high across the country. The price of petrol, which had already crossed Rs 100 in several cities in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, breached the psychological barrier in Mumbai on Saturday. Petrol now costs Rs 100.19 a litre in Mumbai and diesel Rs 92.17 per litre. In Calcutta, petrol price rose to Rs 93.97 a litre and diesel to Rs 87.74. Fuel prices differ from state to state, depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges. Rajasthan levies the highest value-added tax (VAT) on petrol in the country, followed by Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Oil firms had last raised prices on March 24, after which they started cutting prices till April 15 ahead of the Assembly elections in Bengal. All rate revisions were stopped between April 15 and May 4, when they again raised rates. Therefore, there was a 41-day hiatus in rate hikes between March 25 and May 3. Oil firms revise the rates of petrol and diesel daily based on the average price of the benchmark fuel in the global market in the preceding 15 days, and foreign exchange rates. The price of petrol and diesel is the highest in Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan at Rs 104.94 per litre and Rs 97.79 a litre, respectively. After 15 price hikes this month, petrol has risen by Rs 3.54 per litre and diesel by Rs 4.16. Oil industry sources said pump prices are also high because companies are recovering their past revenue losses when they pressed the pause button while global crude prices continued to spike. International oil prices and rupee-dollar exchange rate impact domestic pump prices as India imports over 80 per cent of the crude oil it processes and pays in dollar. The government deregulated the pricing of petrol in June 2010 and diesel in October 2014. Accordingly, state-run retailers are free to change pump prices every day. Since March last year, when the government raised excise duty on fuel to an all-time high, petrol price has increased by Rs 22.46 per litre and diesel by Rs 20.32. The government levies Rs 32.90 per litre of excise duty on petrol and Rs 31.80 a litre on diesel.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-36
