However, analysts expect collections to fall in the coming months because of regional lockdowns in the country. The revenues for the month of April 2021 are 14 per cent higher than Rs 1.23 lakh crore collected in March, the finance ministry said on Saturday. During the month, revenues from domestic transactions (including import of services) are 21 per cent higher over the last month. M.S. Mani, senior director, Deloitte India, said: “The all-time high collections which relates to supplies made in March 21 could now give way to muted collections in the coming months because of lower economic activity in April. The continuing focus on improving compliance and the steps taken to curb evasion have significantly helped the GST collections.” “GST revenues have not only crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore mark successively for the last seven months but have also shown a steady increase,” the ministry said. Rajat Bose, partner at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, said: “The collections for April represent the tax collected towards transactions done in the month of March 2021. Since it is the year end, most companies close their books and raise invoices during the financial close. That is perhaps one of the reasons for the spurt in GST collections in April. The real challenge lies ahead as most parts of the country are again in a lockdown and most industries are temporarily shut.” Gross GST revenue collected in the month of April 2021 is at a record high of Rs 1,41,384 crore, of which CGST is Rs 27,837 crore, SGST Rs 35,621 crore, IGST Rs 68,481 crore, (including Rs 29,599 crore collected on import of goods) and cess Rs 9,445 crore (including Rs 981 crore collected on import of goods). Abhishek Jain, tax partner, EY, said: “The all time high GST collections are extremely encouraging and seem to be the outcome of an uptick in economic recovery and anti evasion measures of the government such as e invoicing, data analytics led investigations and also year end audit and financial closure of the companies as on March 2021. However, the collections may experience a decline in the coming months.” The finance ministry has released in advance to the states the first instalment of Rs 8,873.6 crore of the state disaster response fund (SDRF) for the current fiscal. Up to 50 per cent of the amount released, which is Rs 4,436.8 crore, can be used by the states for Covid-19 containment measures. Normally, the first instalment of SDRF is released in June. “However, in relaxation of normal procedure, not only has the release of SDRF been advanced, the amount has also been released without waiting for the utilisation certificate of the amount provided to the states in the last financial year,” the ministry said. The funds from the SDRF may be used by the states for various measures related to the containment of Covid-19, including meeting the cost of oxygen generation and storage plants in hospitals.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-64

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said it had received representations from various stakeholders for relaxation on compliance requirements because of the ongoing pandemic situation. Tax experts, however, said the extension was “unrealistic” given the lockdown and the intensity of the pandemic. Narayan Jain, advocate and chairman, CCI Professionals Forum, said, “Considering the serious nature of the second wave of the coronavirus, the time should be extended till July 31 instead of May 31. During May, most business houses as well offices of tax professionals will not function because of the lockdowns all over the country.” Nangia & Co LLP partner Shailesh Kumar said: “These relaxations bring relief. However, if the Covid situation does not improve in the next two weeks, the government may need to extend these timelines further.” Appeals to the Commissioner (Appeals) under Chapter XX of the Act, for which the last date of filing is April 1, or thereafter, may be filed within the time provided under that Section or by May 31, 2021, whichever is later. Similar extensions have also been given to the filing of objections to the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) under Section 144C of the Act and income tax return filing in response to notice under Section 148 of the Act. Filing of belated returns under sub-section (4) and revised return under sub-section (5) of Section 139 for assessment year 2020-21, which was required to be submitted on or before March 31, may be filed on or before May 31. Payment of tax deducted under Section 194-IA, Section 194-IB and Section 194M, and filing of challan-cum-statement for such tax deducted, which are required to be paid and furnished by April 30,  may be done on or before  May 31. The statement in Form No. 61, containing particulars of declarations received in Form No. 60, which is due to be furnished on or before April 30, may be done on or before  May 31, the official release said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-64
