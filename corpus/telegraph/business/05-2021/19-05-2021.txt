Profit booking at higher levels to led to the decline in benchmark indices, analysts said. Giving up the 50,000 mark, the 30-share BSE index ended 290.69 points or 0.58 per cent lower at 49,902.64. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty fell 77.95 points or 0.52 per cent to 15,030.15. Bajaj Finserv was the top loser in the Sensex pack, shedding around 2 per cent, followed by HDFC, M&M, Bharti Airtel, UltraTech Cement and Kotak Bank. On the other hand, Sun Pharma, Nestle India, Tech Mahindra, Bajaj Auto and Axis Bank were among the gainers. Binod Modi, Head Strategy at Reliance Securities, said domestic equities corrected after recording sharp upswing in the last two days. Notably, profit-booking was visible in most counters. Barring pharma, realty and IT, most of key sectoral indices traded in red, he added. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai and Tokyo ended on a negative note.

19-05-2021||Business||Sensex drops over 150 points in opening trade||Equity benchmark Sensex dropped over 150 points in opening trade on Wednesday, tracking losses in index majors Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank amid a negative trend in global markets. The market, however, turned flat in the first half hour of trading. The 30-share BSE index was trading 6.73 points or 0.01 per cent higher at 50,200.06, and the broader NSE Nifty advanced 1.50 points or 0.01 per cent to 15,109.60. M&M was the top loser in the Sensex pack, shedding around 1 per cent, followed by ONGC, Kotak Bank, ITC, HUL and HDFC Bank. On the other hand, PowerGrid, SBI, UltraTech Cement, Nestle India and NTPC were among the gainers. In the previous session, Sensex soared 612.60 points or 1.24 per cent to settle at 50,193.33, and Nifty quoted higher by 184.95 points or 1.24 points at 15,108.10. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net buyers in the capital market as they purchased shares worth Rs 618.49 crore on Tuesday, as per provisional exchange data. Binod Modi, Head Strategy at Reliance Securities, said concerns from rising inflationary pressure globally and increasing apprehension among investors about Federal Reserve's soft monetary stance due to sharp rise in CPI inflation may weigh on sentiments. US equities contracted for second consecutive day as mounting inflationary concerns and weak housing data weighed on investors' sentiments, he noted. Modi further said that investors will continue to focus on the trajectory of daily caseload and vaccination ramp up in the country in the near term. "India has been reporting less than 3 lakh daily caseload for the last three days. This will continue to embolden investors. "It indicates that earlier assumption of daily caseload in second wave peaking-out by the end of May or mid of June holds true and adverse impact of second wave should not be felt beyond 1QFY22. This has already aided markets witnessing sharp uptick in the last two trading days," he said. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai and Tokyo were trading on a negative note in mid-session deals. Equities on Wall Street ended with losses in overnight trade. Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 1.15 per cent lower at USD 67.92 per barrel.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-46
19-05-2021||Business||Google News Showcase launches in India ||Alphabet Inc’s Google on Tuesday launched Google News Showcase in India at a time the country is trying to weed out misinformation surrounding a ferocious second wave of Covid-19. Indians have become increasingly reliant on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and messenger applications such as WhatsApp and Telegram for information related to the crisis. Sanjay Gupta, country head and vice-president of Google India, and Brad Bender, vice-president of product management at Google, in a blog post on Tuesday said the programme incentivises and supports news publishers — 30 in number — to curate high quality content on Google’s News and Discover platforms, connecting readers with the news they need. As part of licensing agreements with publishers, Google will pay participating news organisations to give readers access to a limited amount of paywalled content. This feature means readers will have the opportunity to read more of a publisher’s articles than they would otherwise be able to while encouraging them to subscribe. The financial details, however, were not revealed. The partners include Telegraph India, ABP LIVE, the Hindu Group, HT Digital Streams Ltd, Indian Express Group, India TV, NDTV, Zee News, Amar Ujala, Deccan Herald, Punjab Kesari, IANS (Indo Asian News Service) and ANI. “Today’s announcement comes at a particularly challenging moment in India, with Indians seeking out authoritative news and information as the Covid-19 crisis deepens,” Google said in its blog post. The internet services major said that this facility builds on the News Showcase deals signed by 700 news publications in more than a dozen countries, including Germany, Brazil, Canada, France, Japan, UK, Australia, Czech Republic, Italy and Argentina, more than 90 per cent of them representing local or community news and discussions underway in several other countries. Moreover, over the next three years, with increased support from the News Lab, Google plans to train 50,000 journalists and journalism students. The internet major will focus on digital tools to aid verification and combat misinformation online. Further, several new training programmes are being introduced to help small and mid-sized publications achieve financial sustainability. “The Indian news industry and its journalists have embraced technology to engage with readers and make data-driven decisions to improve their business and reporting efforts. We believe it’s important that digital platforms contribute to a sustainable, independent and diverse news ecosystem, working with journalists, news outlets and news associations,” the statement said. According to the Ficci-EY Media and Entertainment industry report published in March 2021, online news subscribers grew between December 2019 and 2020 to reach over 450 million across mobile and desktop users of news sites, portals and aggregators. Online news and magazine app downloads increased 12 per cent in 2020.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-47

Domestic tractor volumes had posted a huge 27 per cent on-year growth last fiscal to a record 9 lakh units. This growth was driven by strong government spend on rural schemes and an increase in farm incomes, supported by a good monsoon. Further, rural India was less impacted by the pandemic last fiscal and farmers redirected savings from spending on marriages, towards tractor purchases. According to Crisil, part of the good performance is expected to continue this year with a forecast of a well-distributed and normal monsoon. This should benefit farm incomes and help sustain the demand for tractors.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-47

The company had posted a net profit of Rs 314 crore a year ago. Consolidated revenue from operations stood at Rs 1,937 crore against Rs 1,946 crore in the same period a year ago. For the financial year ended March 2021, net profit was Rs 1,252 crore against Rs 1,025 crore in 2019-20. Revenue from operations for the fiscal year ended March 2021 stood at Rs 8,005 crore against Rs 7,939 crore a year ago. India revenues stood at Rs 922 crore for the quarter under consideration, a growth of 10 per cent. Torrent’s board has recommended a final dividend of Rs 15 per equity share of Rs 5 each. GSK Pharma net dips GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals’s net profits for the March quarter of 2021 fell to Rs 12.74 crore from Rs 137.94 crore a year ago. The drop in net profits came largely on account of an exceptional item of Rs 119 crore. Revenue for the quarter came in at Rs 807 crore, while total income stood at Rs 837 crore. Canara Bank State-owned Canara Bank has reported a standalone profit of Rs 1,010.87 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 2021 as provision for bad loans declined.

19-05-2021||Business||Cement demand expected to drop 20 per cent in June quarter ||Cement demand in the June quarter of this fiscal is expected to drop 20 per cent because of the localised restrictions implemented by most state governments to break the Covid chain, a rating agency said on Tuesday. Fitch Ratings said cement demand from rural housing, which accounts for nearly a third of the total domestic market, may decrease to a larger extent as it is more dependent on individual customers. However, demand from other segments such as urban housing, infrastructure and commercial construction is likely to be less affected because these are less dependent on retail sales. Key energy commodities, including petroleum coke, imported coal and diesel, which together account for more than 50 per cent of the cement industry’s  costs, rose sharply, particularly after the December quarter of the last fiscal year. Glass segment The sharp increase in demand for glass bottles from the pharma sector, driven by Covid-19 vaccination drive, and a healthy growth in end-user sectors such as automobiles and construction is expected to drive up revenues by 12 per cent year-on-year for domestic glass makers in fiscal 2022. The recovery, already visible since the second half of fiscal 2021, is expected to continue in this fiscal.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-47
19-05-2021||Business||PSU oil retailers once again hike petrol and diesel prices||PSU oil retailers have once again hiked petrol and diesel prices, the tenth this month since the freeze on the price was lifted with the end of the elections in Bengal. In Calcutta, prices on Tuesday were raised by 25 paise in the case of petrol and 29 paise in diesel. The petrol price in Mumbai at Rs 99.14 per litre is almost on the verge of hitting the century mark.  India’s financial capital would be the first among the five major metro cities where the petrol price will touch the Rs 100-per-litre mark if oil firms continued to increase prices which is likely as Brent crude has touched $70 per barrel for the first time since March 15. Crude prices had stabilised around $65 per barrel in April, but they have once again started rising in May. Several cities in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra have already crossed the Rs 100 psychological mark. Analysts said the retail prices of petrol and diesel in India were likely to rise by another Rs 1-2 if the crude prices remain at $70-per-barrel. This could put pressure on the Modi government to cut excise duties as inflationary pressure has pushed the wholesale price inflation to an 11 year high of 10.49 per cent in April. Drivers in Calcutta have to pay Rs 92.92 for a litre of petrol and Rs 86.35 for a litre of petrol on Tuesday. A litre of petrol in Mumbai now comes for Rs 99.14 and diesel is priced at Rs 90.71 per litre. Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges. Rajasthan levies the highest value-added tax (VAT) on petrol in the country, followed by Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Loss recoup Oil industry sources said pump prices were also high because the PSU retailers were recovering their past revenue losses when they pressed the pause button while global crude prices continued to spike. The retailers started raising prices from May 4 after an 18-day hiatus when there was a freeze on account of the state elections in states such as Bengal. International oil prices and the rupee-dollar exchange rate impact domestic pump prices as India imports over 80 per cent crude oil it processes and pays in dollar.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-47

On Dalal Street, the 30-share index soared 612.60 points or 1.24 per cent to settle at 50193.33. This was the highest closing for the gauge since March 16. On Monday, the Sensex had closed with a gain of 848 points. The NSE Nifty also ended above the psychological 15000-mark as it rose 184.95 points or 1.24 points at 15108.10 — the best closing since March 10. The rupee rose 17 paise to close at a seven-week high of 73.05 against the dollar on Tuesday, extending its gains for the third straight session on positive domestic equities and the weakening of the American currency in the overseas markets. At the interbank forex market, the rupee opened at 73.18 and hit an intra-day high of 72.95 and a low of 73.18 during the session. Brent crude prices were ruling at $68.33 per barrel at 10:00PM IST, down $1.13 or 1.63 per cent after hitting a high of $70.23 per barrel on Tuesday. The gains in stock prices over the past two sessions have resulted in the market capitalisation on the BSE rising Rs 5,78,634 crore. A highlight of Tuesday’s trade was the rally seen in mid-cap counters. This led to the NSE mid-cap index outperforming the benchmark by showing a gain of two per cent. On the BSE, its mid-cap index rose 1.87 per cent while the increase in small cap index was at 1.22 per cent. On the Sensex chart, M&M was the top gainer, rallying nearly 6 per cent, followed by Bajaj Auto, Titan and Bajaj Finance. Morgan sees surge US brokerage Morgan Stanley said the ongoing consolidation in equities in India would improve return prospects during the second half of 2021. Leading indicators relating to fundamentals including growth, stability, government policy and RBI policy, and corporate earnings are “generally positive” about equity returns, analysts at Morgan Stanley said. The brokerage maintained its 55000 points target for end-2021 for the benchmark, giving it a 50 per cent probability of coming true. In the “bull” scenario, the Sensex can rise to 61000 points by December 2021, while in the “bear” scenario it can crash to 41000 points. There is a 30 per cent likelihood for the “bull” scenario, which can get triggered by factors such as the virus ebbing completely, recovery in growth being sustained, and global stimulus supporting asset prices. The brokerage gave a lower, 20 per cent probability for the “bear” scenario to play out, and pointed out that factors such as the higher infections continuing in second half, lack of adequate policy response from India and faltering growth can trigger such an eventuality. Calling it a stock picker’s market, the note advised investors to prefer domestic cyclicals the most in their portfolio strategy. Gold prices jump Gold prices rallied on Tuesday with the yellow metal rising Rs 333 to Rs 47,833 per 10 gram in New Delhi. In the international market, the precious metal was trading at $1,869 per ounce and experts feel it could touch $1,900 an ounce in the near term. Analysts continue to remain bullish on gold. “Prices have consolidated over the last few months and recently caught up some momentum,’’ a report from Motilal Oswal Financial Services said. The brokerage estimates prices could reach Rs 50,000 and eventually hit new highs of Rs 56,500 and above over the next 12-15 months.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-47

The company posted a consolidated loss of Rs 7,585.34 crore against a loss of Rs 9,863.75 crore in the year ago period. Analysts had expected the company to report profits of Rs 2500-3000 crore. The net loss came after an exceptional charge of Rs 14,994.30 crore was recognised under JLR's Reimagine strategy. The company had to write down £951.83 million (Rs 9,606.11 crore) of assets from its books as JLR had to shelve some models. Tata Motors had to bear restructuring costs of £533.88 million (Rs 5,388.19 crore). This included costs of £526.36 million (Rs 5,312.29 crore) accruals to settle legal obligations on work performed to date and provisions for redundancies and other third-party obligations along with a defined benefit past service cost of £7.52 million (Rs 75.90 crore). The loss comes at a time the industry is facing a demand slump after the outbreak of the second Covid wave apart from rising input costs and chip shortages. According to Tata Motors, the second wave is expected to have a temporary adverse impact on the demand and supply situation. The first half of this fiscal is likely to remain weak and a sequential improvement is expected from the second quarter, it said. “Cases are still high in many markets while supply chain issues, in particular for semi-conductors, have become more difficult to mitigate and are now impacting production plans for the first quarter. The company is working closely with affected suppliers to resolve the issues,’’ Tata Motors said. The company reported total revenues of Rs 88,627.90 crore in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal compared with Rs 62,492.96 crore in the year-ago period. Revenues for 2020-21 were Rs 2.49 lakh crore against Rs 2.11 lakh crore a year ago. Consolidated net loss stood at Rs 13,395.10 crore compared with a loss of Rs 11,975.23 crore in the previous year. Subsidiary JLR saw net revenues coming at £6.5 billion which represented a growth of 20.5 per cent over the previous year period even as it posted pre-tax profits of £534 million in the fourth quarter and £662 million for the full year before the exceptional charges. JLR sales in the fourth quarter rose 12.4 per cent to 123,483 vehicles, backed by a strong recovery in China where sales grew 127 per cent over the previous year when the the impact of Covid-19 peaked in that market. Sales for the year fell 13.6 per cent to 439,588 vehicles, though sales in China rose 23.4 per. The new Land Rover Defender contributed significantly to retail sales. Standalone revenues at Tata Motors (which represents its domestic and joint operations) jumped 106 per cent to Rs 20,046 crore. The quarter saw its passenger vehicle volumes rise 162 per cent. “The auto industry was deeply impacted by Covid-19 in 2020-21 but witnessed a steady growth in vehicle demand as the nationwide lockdown eased and pent-up demand came to fore supported by a steady recovery of the economy,” Guenter Butschek, CEO and MD, Tata Motors. “At Tata Motors, we scaled up capacity by prudently addressing several supply chain bottlenecks,’’ the Tata Motors chief  said. Fund raising put off The board of Tata Motors on Tuesday deferred its decision on fund-raising. The company did not disclose the reasons or a new date for a meeting. “The board has deferred its decision on fund raising to a subsequent board meeting, which will be intimated to the stock exchanges in due course, ’’ it said  to the stock exchanges .
