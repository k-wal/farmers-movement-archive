Chief executive Pascal Soriot again defended the vaccine rollout on Friday, saying that Anglo-Swedish drugmaker had not overpromised on its ability to supply shots, as he defended big cuts in deliveries that prompted a EU lawsuit. AstraZeneca, which has said it will not make a profit from the shot during the pandemic, was reporting financial details of sales of the vaccine it developed with Oxford University for the first time. It said the revenue included delivery of about 68 million doses, adding that European sales were $224 million, emerging markets $43 million and $8 million in the rest of the world. Sales of $275 million for 68 million doses equates to a price tag of around $4 per shot.

The private sector lender reported a net loss of Rs 3,787.75 crore against a loss of Rs 3,668.33 crore in the same period of the previous year. Analysts had expected Yes Bank to suffer a net loss of Rs 500-1,000 crore. The widening of losses came on the back of a steep fall in its core net interest income (NII-interest earned minus interest expended) which declined to Rs 987 crore from Rs 2,560 crore in the preceding three months and Rs 1,274 crore in the same period of the previous year. Moreover, provisions also rose to Rs 5,240 crore, a sequential jump of 138 per cent over Rs 2,199 crore and a 7.5 per cent rise over Rs 4,872 crore in the year-ago period. While gross non performing assets (NPAs) in absolute terms fell to Rs 28,609.53 crore from Rs 32,877.59 crore in the same period of the previous year, the percentage of gross NPAs during the quarter stood at 15.41 per cent against 16.80 per cent. Marico net FMCG firm Marico Ltd on Friday reported a 14.07 per cent increase in its consolidated net profit at Rs 227 crore for the March 2021 quarter, helped by a double-digit volume growth in the domestic market. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 199 crore in the year-ago quarter. Revenue from operations of the Mumbai-based firm was up 34.49 per cent at Rs 2,012 crore during the quarter under review against Rs 1,496 crore in the year-ago period.

However, for the full fiscal 2020-21, the core sector contracted 7 per cent compared with a subdued 0.4 per cent expansion in 2019-20. “The eight core sector output rose to a 32-month high of 6.8 per cent in March 2021 chiefly on account of a negative base of (-) 8.5 per cent in the corresponding month of the previous year. Therefore, one needs to read the core sector growth number with caution,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Care Ratings. In February, output had fallen at the fastest pace in six months, contracting 3.8 per  cent. According to data released by the department for promotion of industry and internal trade, coal (-21.9 per cent), crude oil (-3.1 per cent), refinery products (-0.7 per cent) and fertilisers (-5 per cent) saw contraction. Aditi Nayar, chief economist at Icra, said, “The low base of the lockdown would push up the year-on-year expansion of the core industries. However, we have observed a slackening in sequential momentum in April 2021 in electricity demand, vehicle registrations and generation of GST e-way bills, revealing the impact of the recent surge in Covid infections.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-64
01-05-2021||Business||Finance ministry to give additional Rs 15,000 crore to states as interest-free 50-year loan to spend on capital projects ||The finance ministry has said it will give an additional Rs 15,000 crore to the states as interest-free 50-year loan to spend on capital projects in the current fiscal. The Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Expenditure for 2021-22 also includes incentives to states for monetising/recycling of infrastructure assets and disinvestment of the state public sector enterprises (SPSEs). The scheme has three parts, including linkage of asset monetisation with funds released by the Centre. Aditi Nayar, chief economist, Icra, said, “Higher capital spending by the Centre and the state governments remains one of the upsides to the GDP growth expected in fiscal 2021-22. The additional funding under the interest-free loan to states for capex is welcome, despite its modest outlay.” “The novel aspect this time is that it nudges states to go in for sale of assets. Monetisation of assets unlocks their value, eliminates their holding cost and enables scarce public funds to be deployed to new projects, thus speeding up the implementation of the National Infrastructure Pipeline. It will be interesting to see how states fare on this count as some of them have been talking of such sales in the past but have not taken affirmative action in a significant way,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Care Ratings. Part one of the scheme relates to the North East and hill stóates and an amount of Rs 2,600 crore has been earmarked for this. Part two is for the states not included in part one. An amount of Rs 7,400 crore has been earmarked for this part. Part three of the scheme provides incentives to states for monetisation/recycling of infrastructure assets and disinvestment of state public sector enterprises. About Rs 5,000 crore has been allocated for this part of the scheme.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-65
01-05-2021||Business||Wipro revises IT services revenue outlook to 8-10 per cent sequential growth||Wipro on Friday revised upwards its IT services revenue outlook to 8-10 per cent sequential growth in the June 2021 quarter. This comes after the completion of its  $1.45-billion buyout of Capco. Earlier this month, while announcing the results for the March quarter of 2021, Wipro had said that it expects to clock a sequential growth of 2-4 per cent in its IT services revenues in the June quarter. However, this did not include revenues from the Capco and Ampion acquisitions. In March, the Bangalore-based firm had announced the acquisition of Capco in a $1.45-billion deal. In a communication to the bourses on Friday, the company said the Capco acquisition was completed on April 29, 2021. Therefore, it has now decided to include revenues from Capco, thereby leading to the upward revision in revenue guidance for the June quarter. “We expect revenue from our IT services business to be in the range of $2,324-2,367 million,” Wipro said. The company added that this updated forecast does not include revenues from the Ampion acquisition. Wipro is set to acquire Ampion, an Australia-based provider of cybersecurity and engineering services, for $117 million. This deal is expected to close this quarter. Wipro had posted revenues of $2,152.4 million in its IT services business in the fourth quarter of 2020-21. Though Wipro has lagged behind its peers such as TCS and Infosys, analysts remain cautiously optimistic about its prospects. “A simplified operating model, leadership augmentation and Capco acquisition show Wipro’s growth aspiration and its resolve to take big bets. However, tangible results hinge on strong execution. Considering a poor execution track record, we prefer to wait for clear signs of improvement in operating metrics,’’ analysts at Emkay have said in a note.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-65

The bank has been reorganised into three pillars of ‘business verticals’, ‘delivery channels’ and, ‘technology and digital’. The lender has made a slew of changes in the senior leadership roles as well, with current group head for corporate banking Rahul Shukla being entrusted with the commercial banking (MSME) and rural vertical. “We are creating engines of growth with top tier talent backed by technology and digital transformation to capitalise on opportunities that will accrue in the coming time,” Jagdishan said. “I am sure this structure will create the necessary strategic and execution agility that we need to serve our customers across India, retail, commercial (MSME) and corporate segments,” Jagdishan added. ‘Business verticals’ will include corporate, retail and private banking, government and institutional banking, retail assets and payments. The bank is increasing its focus on commercial banking. Under ‘delivery verticals’, facets such as branch banking, tele-service/sales (including virtual relationship manager or VRM channel), sales channels aligned with the business verticals and digital marketing are being included. All the businesses and delivery channels will be backed by the ‘technology and digital’ vertical as the core backbone. Executive director Kaizad Bharucha will continue to drive wholesale banking, including corporate banking group, capital and commodities markets group and financial institutions. Parag Rao, the group head for payments business, will now drive the technology transformation and digital agenda, besides continuing to be responsible for the payments vertical.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-65
01-05-2021||Business|| Reliance posts 129 per cent jump in net profits for the fourth quarter||Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) on Friday beat Street estimates by posting a 129 per cent jump in net profits for the fourth quarter ended March 31, following a strong performance by the oil-to-chemical (O2C) and retail divisions. Consolidated net profit came in at Rs 14,995 crore compared with Rs 6,546 crore a year ago. The sharp jump in its bottomline, however, should be seen in the context of a low base last year since the onset of the pandemic had led to a lockdown, which not only affected its domestic business but exports as well. This was reflected in its revenues which stood at Rs 172,095 crore — a rise of almost 13.6 per cent over Rs 151,461 crore in the year-ago period. Analysts had expected RIL to post net profits in the region of Rs 14,800 crore. In the fourth quarter, consolidated net profit attributable to shareholders was Rs 13,227 crore against Rs 6,348 crore a year ago. Annual numbers For the year ended March 31, 2021, RIL recorded consolidated revenues of Rs 539,238 crore, which was lower than Rs 659,997 crore in the previous fiscal as its businesses were affected by the country-wide lockdown, particularly during the first half. The decrease in revenue was primarily because of lower volumes and realisation across key products in the O2C segment. Its retail business also reported a lower revenue because of the pandemic. The year saw segment revenues for the O2C business declining by 29 per cent to Rs 320,008 crore from Rs 451,335 crore. RIL added that during the year, its exports also decreased by 28.2 per cent to Rs 145,143 crore from Rs 202,205 crore in 2019-20. While RIL has been in the news for divesting some of its shale gas assets, the year also saw an impairment of its assets at Rs 15,691 crore. O2C leads in Q4 As expected, its O2C business led from the front, buoyed by firm crude oil prices during the quarter. The segment revenues showed a robust growth of 21 per cent over the preceding quarter to Rs 101,080 while the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margins were steady at 11.3 per cent. RIL said the growth was primarily on account of higher realisation across product portfolios and higher volumes. Strong average Brent crude price because of weather-related supply disruption and continued supply cuts by Opec plus helped the numbers. Digital performance While RIL’s digital services business has been a key anchor of its strong performance over the last several quarters, rival Bharti Airtel has been giving a tough fight to Jio in terms of subscriber additions. During the quarter, Jio Platforms Ltd (JPL) put up a mixed show with net profits rising a muted 0.5 per cent sequentially to Rs 3,508 crore from Rs 3,489 crore. The average revenue per user (ARPU) trailed analysts’ expectations as it fell to Rs 138.2 from Rs 151 in the preceding three months. The Street had pencilled in a drop in its ARPU as the industry did away with the interconnect user charge. Another reason for the fall was the lower number of days during the quarter. During the period, JPL saw its revenues falling 6.1 per cent to Rs 18,278 crore from Rs 19,475 crore in the third quarter. Robust retail The retail business also benefited from the pent-up demand during the quarter. Revenues from operations rose 25 per cent sequentially to Rs 41,296 crore from Rs 33,018 crore, while EBITDA showed a rise of 17 per cent to Rs 3617 crore. Net profit of Reliance Retail rose 45 per cent to Rs 2,247 crore over the year-ago period. Net cash company RIL officials said the company continues to have a strong balancesheet and it remains a net cash company. Its cash and cash equivalents stood at Rs 254,019 crore as on March 31, 2021. This was higher than the outstanding debt of Rs 251,811 crore. It may be recalled that RIL became a net debt-free company last year after raising more than Rs 1.50 trillion in Jio Platforms and a rights issue.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-65
