Iron ore is a key raw material used in steel making. Any change in its prices has a direct impact on the rates of steel. The announcement has come at a time when steel is trading at an all-time high. In May 2021, the steel makers raised prices of Hot Rolled Coil (HRC) by Rs 4,000 to Rs 67,000 per tonne and Cold Rolled Coil (CRC) by Rs 4,500 to Rs 80,000 per tonne. After the price revision, a tonne of lump ore or high grade iron will cost Rs 7,650 a tonne while the buyers will get iron ore fines or inferior grade ore for Rs 6,560 per tonne, NMDC said in a BSE filing. The revised prices exclude royalty, District Mineral Fund (DMF), National Mineral Exploration Trust (DMET), cess, forest permit fee, and other taxes, the company said. It added that the new rates are effective from May 12, 2021. On April 14, 2021, NMDC had fixed the rates for lump ore at Rs 6,950 a tonne and for fines at Rs 5,060 a tonne. NMDC, under the ministry of steel, is India's single largest iron ore producer, producing about 35 MT iron ore annually from its three fully mechanized mines located in Chhattisgarh and Karnataka. Besides, the company is also involved in the exploration of other minerals like copper, rock phosphate, lime stone, dolomite and gypsum.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-52

An ET Now report said the $106-billion group will acquire 65 per cent for Rs 780 crore in 1mg, thus valuing the latter at Rs 1,200 crore. This comes days after the group infused funds in the start-up. Entracker, a platform that monitors tech companies, had earlier reported that 1mg has allotted 29,054 compulsorily convertible debentures for which it received Rs 25 crore and another Rs 75 crore will be infused at a later stage. The 1mg acquisition will thus pitch the Tatas against Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries. It may be recalled that last August, RIL had announced the acquisition of a majority stake in Netmeds, the Chennai-based online pharmacy, for a cash consideration of around Rs 620 crore. A consortium led by Multiples Alternate Asset Management is acquiring the animal health business of Zydus Cadila in India and certain other countries for Rs 2,921 crore. Multiples along with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Rakesh Jhunjhunwala-led RARE Enterprises have signed the business transfer agreement and other ancillary pacts with Animal Healthcare Established Markets Undertaking (Zydus AH). Zydus AH is the second-largest and one of the fastest growing animal health businesses in India. The business holds a leadership position across a range of therapeutic and nutritional products for the livestock and poultry animal segments. It employs nearly 700 people and has a manufacturing facility in Haridwar. For the year ended March 31, 2020, the business recorded a revenue of Rs 513.3 crore. The consortium will purchase the business of Zydus AH focused on India and certain other countries as a going concern basis through a slump sale from Zydus Animal Health and Investments Ltd (ZAHL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Cadila Healthcare Ltd (Cadila).||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-53

Exporters’ body Fieo urged the government to immediately release all benefits under duty drawback, tax refund scheme RoDTEP and goods and services tax as that would help in making shipments profitable. The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (Fieo) president S. K. Saraf also expressed his concern over the rising prices of domestic inputs and suggested reduction in import tariff to soften the prices. He urged shipping companies to rationally increase freight. Liquidity should be addressed by encouraging banks to lend to the export sector and more importantly instantly releasing all export benefits, Saraf said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-53

This is the company’s highest full-year profit despite operational challenges at the beginning of the fiscal because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The flagship of MP Birla Group on Wednesday reported a fourth-quarter net profit of Rs 249.33 crore, up 28 per cent from Rs 194.73 crore a year ago, backed by a 24.5 per cent jump in cement sales volume to 4.17 million tonnes (mt). Revenue for the January-March quarter of 2020-21 at Rs 2,146.12 crore was up 24.9 per cent over the previous year.

Sales by volume for the fiscal declined 1.8 per cent to 13.39mt from 13.64mt in the previous year. “In the light of the massive disruptions faced at the beginning of the fiscal, 2020-21 wasn’t disappointing from the standpoint of profitability. But in the wake of the second wave, the year ahead looks more challenging,” said chairman Harsh Vardhan Lodha. Asian Paints has reported an over 81.13 per cent jump in its consolidated net profit at Rs 869.89 crore for the March quarter compared with Rs 480.25 crore in the corresponding previous quarter. Revenue from operations rose 43.5 per cent to Rs 6,651.43 crore from Rs 4,635.59 crore a year ago. “We have seen a very strong quarter aided by good demand across rural and urban areas at the country level,” said Amit Syngle, managing director and CEO, Asian Paints Limited. On the heels of a healthy Q2 and Q3 recovery, this quarter saw exceptional growth across business and consumer segments, The company said that in the wake of improved demand, particularly in the second half of the fiscal, it managed to raise prices during the March quarter, which led to marginal improvement in realisation per ton, but profitability was under pressure due to a sharp increase in raw material and fuel costs. The companyfs gross borrowings stood at Rs 4,046.42 crore at the end of March as against Rs 4,281.95 crore a year earlier, even after investing Rs 644 crore into the Mukutban project in Maharashtra during the year.

By cutting debt and borrowing cost, the company managed to reduce its finance cost for 2020-21 by 23.6 per cent from the previous year. “In the light of the massive disruptions faced at the beginning of the financial year, 2020-21 wasnft disappointing from the standpoint of profitability. But in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic, the year ahead looks more challenging. To my mind, Indiafs ability to contain the pandemic through rapid inoculation and other means holds the key to economic revival,h said Harsh Vardhan Lodha, chairman, Birla Corporation.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-53

The demand has been clearly impacted by the second wave of Covid-19, both in terms of low consumer sentiments and closure of dealerships due to lockdown restrictions,” Rajesh Menon, director-general of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), said. There were no passenger vehicle sales in April 2020 because of the coronavirus-led nationwide lockdown. Passenger vehicle sales (wholesale) in India declined 10 per cent to 2,61,633 units in April 2021 compared with March 2021 as the Covid-19-led restrictions impacted demand, Siam said. Passenger vehicle sales in March 2021 stood at 2,90,939 units. Two-wheeler dispatches to dealers declined 33 per cent to 9,95,097 units last month compared with 14,96,806 units in March.

Indian Oil, the country’s biggest refiner, has reduced runs to an average of between 85 per cent and 88 per cent of processing capacity, a company official said, adding runs could be cut further as its plants at Gujarat, Mathura and Panipat are facing problems storing bitumen and sulphur. BPCL has cut its crude imports by 1 million barrels in May and will reduce purchases by 2 million barrels in June, a company official said. Demand down 9.4% The lockdown in several states has hit fuel demand by 9.4 per cent in April compared with the preceding month, official data showed on Wednesday.

13-05-2021||Business||Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra calls for GST Council meet||A meeting of the GST Council ought to be called immediately to discuss a raft of issues, including the grim possibility that the shortfall in compensation to the states could widen just when they need the revenues most to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra has said. The GST Council, the apex decision making body for GST, last met on October 5 last year. The Council is obligated to meet at least once in a quarter. But this time the gap between the meetings has stretched to over seven months and there is still no indication from the Centre when it intends to convene the next one. In a letter written to his central counterpart Nirmala Sitharaman, Mitra, who assumed charge as the finance minister of Bengal for the third time earlier this week, said the compensation payable to the states to meet the shortfall in GST compensation could be much higher than anticipated in the wake of the second Covid wave that forced states to once again adopt lockdown measures to check the spread of the virus. Mitra said in his letter that the Centre’s projected shortfall was Rs 156,164 crore in 2021-22 — a forecast that was made before the second Covid wave engulfed the nation “Now, due to Covid wave 2 and lockdowns, the compensation will be much higher than what was projected earlier. This is undoubtedly deeply distressing,” Mitra wrote on Wednesday. He exhorted Sitharaman to urgently call a virtual meeting of the Council to discuss the impending situation and hash out new solutions to the impending crisis. Mitra reminded the finance minister that the procedure and conduct of business regulations of the GST Council provides for a meeting once every quarter. “You would agree not meeting every quarter to discuss vital issues is not in line with the very principle of cooperative federalism,” Mitra added. The letter comes soon after the Centre turned down a plea from the Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to exempt GST on Covid-19 vaccines and related supplies. Sitharaman had argued that far from reducing the cost of the vaccines — a burden that the Centre has coolly offloaded to the states — it will see vaccination costs rise because the vaccine makers would not be able to claim input tax credits.
This is an untested claim and will only serve only to fortify the specious arguments of the vaccine makers justifying why they charge states a higher price than the rate at which they provide it to the Centre. Compensation to the states to meet shortfall in GST collection turned into a highly contentious issue last year when the Centre tried to wriggle out of its Constitutionally-mandated responsibility to pay full amount. It had tried to attributed a substantial part of the shortfall to the pandemic, arguing that it wasn't obliged to pay the sum that it had arbitrarily computed. It said that it would permit the states to borrow more on the strength of their already-strained balance sheet to meet a part of the GST shortfall. Under pressure from the Opposition-ruled states, the Centre had to give in and dropped that argument. Eventually, the Centre agreed to borrow a sum of Rs 1.10 lakh crore, which constitutes two thirds of the outstanding dues for 2020-21, and pass it on to the states. The states will be required to borrow the rest and pay it out of the compensation cess that is likely to be extended beyond the July 2022 when it was supposed to cease.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-53

After the Monetary Policy Committee meeting last month, governor Shaktikanta Das had announced that the RBI will conduct open market purchases of government securities of Rs 1 lakh crore under the G-SAP 1.0 in the first quarter of the financial year 2021-22. The first such auction of Rs 25,000 crore was held on April 15. “The Reserve Bank will conduct the second tranche of open market purchase of government securities of Rs 35,000 crore under the G-sec Acquisition Programme (G-SAP 1.0) on May 20, 2021,” the central bank said in a statement.

The National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage is expected to attract an investment of Rs 45,000 crore, information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters after a cabinet meeting. The government aims to achieve a manufacturing capacity of 50 Gigawatt Hour of ACC and 5 GWh of niche ACC. The facilities will promote green growth and mainly use local products such as copper and bauxite, the minister said. “Each selected ACC battery storage manufacturer would have to commit to set up an ACC manufacturing facility of minimum five GWh capacity and ensure a minimum 60 per cent domestic value addition at the project level within five years,” the government said in a statement. The incentive will be paid out on the basis of sales, energy efficiency, battery lifecycle and the level of localisation. The government statement said the incentive amount will increase with increased
specific energy density and cycles and higher local value addition. The beneficiary firms have to achieve a domestic value addition of at least 25 per cent and incur a mandatory investment Rs 225 crore /GWh within two years. The domestic value addition must go up to 60 per cent in five years. Apart from electric vehicles, such battery storages will cater to the consumer electronics industry and electricity grids, given the intermittent nature of power from clean energy sources such as solar and wind. The latest move is expected to offset imports currently set at a high of Rs 20,000 crore and boost climate friendly growth. “Now as we are producing battery storage, it will help in net saving of the import bill as we are importing all requirements of battery storage and at the same time reflect on our climate friendly growth path," Javadekar said. “It will be used in consumer electronics, electric vehicles, advanced electricity grids, solar rooftop, solar power plants which are major battery consuming sectors," the minister said. He said the domestic manufacturing of battery storage will create more job opportunities. The Centre is implementing 13 PLI schemes and have approved schemes for nine sectors,  covering automobiles, IT hardware including mobile phones & telecom equipment, white goods, chemical cells and textiles.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-53
13-05-2021||Business||Retail inflation slips to three-month low of 4.29 per cent in April||Retail inflation slipped to a three-month low of 4.29 per cent in April while factory output surged 22.4 per cent in March, benefiting from the base effect of a lockdown-marred month a year back. The CPI inflation moderated from 5.52 per cent in March, driven by a decline in vegetable prices of 14.2 per cent which pulled down inflation in the food basket significantly. The RBI mainly looks at retail inflation based on the consumer price index (CPI) while deciding its monetary policy. The retail inflation is well within the monetary policy committee’s medium-term inflation target range of 4 per cent with a tolerance limit of 2 per cent on either side. This is the fifth straight month that retail inflation is within the MPC’s target band. In April last year, data was imputed for CPI groups for which no data was available or collected or transacted because of the nationwide lockdown. Aditi Nayar, chief economist at Icra, said the prevailing localised restrictions appear to have had a limited impact on retail inflation in April. However, as the lockdown base effect fades, CPI inflation is expected to bounce back to an average of 5 per cent in the remaining first half of 2021-22, ruling out the possibility of further interest rate cuts to support economic activity. Factory output The base effect had an even bigger effect on the IIP numbers. The 22.4 per cent growth in industrial output in March came after a contraction of (-) 0.9 per cent and (-) 3.4 per cent in January and February 2021, respectively. The manufacturing sector — which constitutes 77.63 per cent of IIP — grew 25.8 per cent in March 2021. The mining sector output also grew 6.1 per cent, while power generation increased 22.5 per cent. In February, both manufacturing and mining had contracted by 3.7 per cent and 5.5 per cent, respectively, while electricity grew by a piffle at 0.1 per cent. The March numbers give a false sense of normalcy because of a statistical base effect. Nayar said, “It’s more meaningful to compare the industrial performance in March 2021 with March 2019, which reveals a mild albeit sobering contraction of 0.5 per cent.” Industrial production had plunged 18.7 per cent in March last year after the Covid-19 outbreak and remained in the negative zone till August 2020.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-53
