The electric-car maker’s pitch to lower duties, however, is likely to face resistance from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration which has championed high import taxes for many industries in a bid to boost local manufacturing. “We want to do so, but import duties are the highest in the world by far of any large country,” Musk said in reply to a tweet about launching the company’s cars in India. “But we are hopeful that there will be at least a temporary tariff relief for electric vehicles,” Musk added. Other luxury auto makers in India have also lobbied the government in the past to lower taxes on imported cars but have had little success due to opposition from rivals with domestic operations. Tesla, which aims to begin sales in India this year, said in a letter to ministries and the country’s leading think-tank Niti Aayog that slashing federal taxes on imports of fully assembled electric cars to 40 per cent would be more appropriate, according to a Reuters report. That compares with current rates of 60 per cent for cars priced below $40,000 and 100 per cent for those above $40,000. “The argument is that at 40 per cent  import duty, electric cars can become more affordable but the threshold is still high enough to compel companies to manufacture locally if demand picks up,” the Reuters report quoting sources said. According to Tesla’s US website, only one model — the Model 3 Standard Range Plus — is priced below $40,000. The Indian market for premium EVs, indeed for electric cars in general, is still very much in its infancy with vehicles far too costly for the average consumer and very little charging infrastructure in place. Just 5,000 of the 2.4 million cars sold in India last year were electric and most were priced below $28,000.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-130
25-07-2021||Business||ICICI Bank net profit jumps 78 per cent in Q1 ||ICICI Bank on Saturday reported a 78 per cent rise in standalone net profits for the quarter ended June 2021 on the back of a sharp fall in provisions. The private sector lender posted a net profit of Rs 4,616.02 crore compared with Rs 2,599.15 crore in the same period of the previous year. During the quarter, provisions at the lender declined to Rs 2,851.69 crore against Rs 7,593.95 crore in the year-ago period. ICICI Bank said it has changed the policy on non-performing loans to make it more conservative. The change in policy resulted in higher provisions for non-performing advances amounting to Rs 1,127. The bank’s provisions would have been lower had it not implemented the new rule. Based on the current assessment of the portfolio, the bank wrote back Covid-19 provisions amounting to Rs 1,050 crore made in the earlier periods. The bank said the impact of the pandemic on credit quality and provisions is uncertain and will depend on the trajectory, progress and effectiveness of the vaccination programme. As of June 2021, the bank had restructured loans worth Rs 3,891.15 crore of 5,510 accounts of which personal loans stood at Rs 924.74 crore and corporate loans at Rs 2,956.05 crore. During the quarter, there was a slight deterioration in its asset quality with the percentage of gross non-performing assets (NPAs) to gross customer assets rising to 5.15 per cent from 4.96 per cent sequentially. It was, however, lower than 5.46 per cent in the same period of the previous year. In absolute terms, gross NPAs rose to Rs 43,148.28 crore from Rs 41,373.42 crore in the January-March period. The net interest income of the bank rose 18 per cent to Rs 10,936 crore from Rs 9,280 crore in the year-ago period.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-131

Total FDI, including equity, re-invested earnings and capital, rose 10 per cent to $81.72 billion during 2020-21 against $74.39 billion in 2019-20. Exports, too, are recording healthy growth.

Profit for the April-June period of 2021-22 was Rs 3,343.4 crore on a consolidated basis against Rs 2,567.07 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal. Revenue from operations were up at Rs 14,240.76 crore compared with Rs 10,478.46 crore on a like-to-like basis. However, profits slipped 12.4 per cent on a sequential basis from the January-March quarter, while revenue dropped 7.5 per cent as the company grappled with the second wave of Covid-19 during April-May, which led to sporadic lockdowns across the country. In a commentary posted on the bourses, ITC said: “Localised lockdowns and mobility restrictions imposed by states  during the second Covid wave rendered the operating environment during the quarter extremely challenging and impacted the strong recovery momentum witnessed in the recent quarters. The situation continues to improve with the progressive easing of restrictions and increased mobility from mid-June 2021.” At least one analyst dubbed ITC’s profit and EBIDTA numbers ‘‘below estimate’’ but pointed out that the overall sales are in line with expectations. Abneesh Roy of Edelweiss Securities said the volume growth of 32 per cent in cigarettes is ahead of expectations on a low base of a 40 per cent dip. “The overall PAT is below estimate,” Roy added. Cigarette volumes, which nearly reached pre-Covid levels during January-March, slid again during the last quarter, dragging down the profit before tax (PBT) to Rs 3,461.91 crore in the first quarter of FY21 from Rs 3,895.27 crore in the fourth quarter. FMCG-others, which include food, health and personal care, showed a marginal drop in PBT though revenue grew sequentially despite the disruptions.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-131
