This clarification sought by the bourses is a fallout of market regulator Sebi last month asking PNB Housing Finance to put on hold its Rs 4,000-crore deal with the Carlyle group. According to Sebi, the move was ultra-vires of its articles of association (AoA) which say that in the case of such an allotment, the valuation must be done from a registered valuer. Sebi’s decision has been challenged by PNB Housing in the Securities Appellate Tribunal. At the hearing recently, the senior counsel for PNB Housing had said a couple of other firms had also priced their preferential issues on the basis of Sebi’s ICDR rules and there was no objection from the regulator. Sebi recently began a preliminary enquiry into the preferential issue of LIC Housing Finance and another listed firm and it had asked the stock exchanges to examine the proposed allotment. Last month, LIC Housing Finance had said that its parent will infuse an equity capital of about Rs 2,334.70 crore by picking up an additional stake. The company was proposing to issue shares at Rs 514.25 apiece to the promoter and the plan was to issue preferential shares up to 4,54,00,000 through a private placement to LIC. For this, an extraordinary general meeting EGM will be held on July 19 to seek the nod of its shareholders. LIC Housing Finance had then said that the issue price at Rs 514.25 per share is the price calculated under Sebi regulations, 2018. In a regulatory filing on Saturday, the company disclosed that it received communication from both the bourses on July 12 seeking clarifications on compliance with the provisions of its AOA. “The company has clarified that there is no violation of the provisions of AoA as the price has been determined in accordance with the relevant provisions of the AoA as well as the Companies Act, 2013 and Sebi (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018,” LIC Housing Finance said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-137

Collection efficiency for the microfinance industry had reached around 90 per cent at the end of March. The delinquency levels (30 days past due) on an industry basis, which includes NBFC-MFIs, banks, small finance banks, NBFCs and non-profit MFIs, was 9.12 per cent as of March 31, 2021, improving from 13.23 per cent as of December 31, 2020. The top 10 states, led by Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Assam and Rajasthan, account for 83 per cent of the gross loan portfolio of the microfinance industry and most of them announced restrictions from mid-April onwards to curb the spread of the virus. “In Bengal, a lot of economic activity in Calcutta and the districts depend upon the availability of transport systems. With restrictions, we find lesser collection levels. Similar situation in Maharashtra in places around Pune and some pockets in western Maharashtra,” said P. Satish, executive director of microfinance industry body Sa-Dhan. “The effect of the second wave in terms of human cost was high because there was unfortunate loss of life of staff members and their families and borrowers and their families,” said Satish. City-based Bandhan Bank, which has a substantial loan book in the microfinance segment, has reported to bourses a dip in its collection efficiency to 72 per cent in the micro finance loan book at the end of June from 95 per cent in March. “There have been localised lockdowns to prevent the spread of the second wave which intensified from the second half of April to May. It has started ebbing and most states are gradually opening up,” said Manoj Nambiar, managing director and board member of Arohan.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-138

Net profits came in at Rs 7,729.6 crore, a 16.1 per cent increase over Rs 6,658.62 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal. Analysts had expected the bank to post profits of around Rs 7,900 crore. Provisions jumped to Rs 4,830.84 crore from Rs 3,891.52 crore in the year-ago period, a rise of 24 per cent. Further, the asset quality also deteriorated with the percentage of gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rising to 1.47 per cent from 1.32 per cent sequentially and 1.36 per cent in the April-June 2020 quarter. In absolute terms, the gross NPAs stood at Rs 17,098.51 crore against Rs 15,086 crore in the preceding three months and Rs 13,773.46 crore in the year-ago period. Provisions and contingencies for the quarter included specific loan loss provision of Rs 4,219.7 crore and general and other provisions of Rs 611.1 crore. The lender said that the second wave of Covid-19 disrupted business activities for close to two-thirds of the quarter, leading to a decrease in efficiency in collection efforts and a higher level of provision. The bank disclosed in its notes to accounts that it implemented a one-time restructuring (according to the RBI’s August 2020 circular) for 3,36,107 accounts where the exposure stood at around Rs 7,801 crore. Of this, personal loans stood at Rs 5,457.35 crore and corporate loan recast were at Rs 1,735.30 crore. The rest belonged to MSMEs and others. Under the central bank’s second resolution framework announced in May, it has implemented such plans for 33 borrower accounts having aggregate exposure of Rs 10.64 crore. While HDFC Bank is the first big lender to declare the first-quarter numbers, the deterioration in its asset quality indicates that banks would see stress in their books due to the second wave. However, analysts are of the view that the impact will be considerably lesser this time than what was seen after the pandemic hit last year. The lender disclosed that total advances as on June 2021 were Rs 1,147,652 crore, an increase of 14.4 per cent over June 2020. According to its internal business classification, retail loans grew 9.3 per cent, commercial and rural banking loans rose 25.1 per cent and other wholesale loans grew 10.2 per cent. Domestic retail advances stood at Rs 5,23,489 crore during the quarter. During the first quarter, the bank’s net interest income (interest earned less interest expended) increased to Rs 17,009 crore from Rs 15,665.4 crore in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the board of HDFC Bank on Saturday decided to tap the international markets to raise capital through Basel-III compliant additional tier-I capital (AT1 bonds) on a public or a private placement basis. However, the lender did not disclose the size of the proposed offering.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-138
