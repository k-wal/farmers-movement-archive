"Geographically, we set September quarter records in the Americas, Europe and Rest of Asia Pacific. We also set a September quarter record in India, thanks in part to a very strong reception to this quarter's launch of our online store in the country," Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an earnings call. In September, Apple launched its first online store in India - a market that is dominated by Android smartphones. Apple, which competes in the premium smartphone segment in India with players like Samsung and OnePlus, has been aggressively ramping up its presence in the Indian market. The US-based company, in collaboration with partners like Wistron and Foxconn, had recently started assembling iPhone 11 in India. According to research firm Canalys, the tech giant's renewed focus on India paid off with a double-digit growth to nearly 8,00,000 units in the region during the July-September 2020 quarter. A Counterpoint report had noted that Apple led the premium segment (over Rs 30,000) surpassing OnePlus even before its flagship launch, driven by strong demand for its iPhone SE 2020 and the iPhone 11. Its latest offering, iPhone 12 will further strengthen its position in the December quarter, it had noted. India's smartphone shipments in the premium segment (priced above Rs 30,000) was one of the least affected segments and reached its highest-ever share in the overall India smartphone market, contributing more than 4 per cent in total smartphone shipments, as per Counterpoint. Apple, in its statement, said international sales accounted for 59 per cent of the revenue (USD 64.7 billion) for the fourth quarter ended September 26, 2020. "Despite the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, Apple is in the midst of our most prolific product introduction period ever, and the early response to all our new products, led by our first 5G-enabled iPhone lineup, has been tremendously positive," Cook said in the statement. He added that Apple capped off a fiscal year defined by innovation in the face of adversity with a September quarter record, led by all-time records for Mac and Services. "We also achieved new September quarter records in the vast majority of countries that we track, including among others the US, Canada Brazil, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Russia, India, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said on the investor call. Apple's products revenue was at USD 50.1 billion, while services set an all-time record of USD 14.5 billion.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-250

The acquisition will give it well-known brands such as Araldite, Araldite Karpenter and Araseal. Pidilite will be acquiring Huntsman Advanced Materials Solutions Pvt Ltd (HAMSPL), which makes adhesives, sealants and other products. In a regulatory filing to the stock exchanges, Pidilite said while the acquisition will be done in cash, it excludes customary working capital and other adjustments, subject to certain preconditions being met prior to the closing of the transaction. The deal also includes the company’s Indian subcontinent business, apart from a trademark licence for West Asia, Africa and Asean countries. Huntsman will receive around 90 per cent of the cash consideration at closing and the balance under an earn-out within 18 months if the business achieves sales revenue in line with 2019. The transaction is expected to close by next week. Huntsman had a revenue of around Rs 400 crore in 2019, from its operations here. “Araldite will add to the already very strong portfolio of our adhesives and sealants and will complement our retail portfolio,” said Pidilite managing director Bharat Puri. Shares of Pidilite closed with gains of around five per cent at Rs 1,590.35 on the BSE on Thursday.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-250

The new takeover price was set at $131.5 a share, down from $135 in the original deal, the companies said in a statement on Thursday, bringing the total price tag to about $15.8 billion. That represents an overall discount of $425 million for LVMH, which is led by billionaire businessman Bernard Arnault, a consummate dealmaker who is betting the French giant can restore Tiffany’s lustre by investing in stores and new collections. “We are as convinced as ever of the formidable potential of the Tiffany brand and believe that LVMH is the right home for Tiffany and its employees during this exciting next chapter,” Arnault said in the statement. Other key terms of the deal, initially agreed last November, remain unchanged, the companies added. The transaction, which has received regulatory clearance, is expected to close in early 2021, subject to Tiffany shareholder approval. Under the revised deal, Tiffany will pay its regular quarterly dividend of $0.58 per share on November 19. “Tiffany and LVMH have also agreed to settle their pending litigation in the Delaware Chancery Court,” the statement from the companies said. War of words The new deal, whose main details emerged on Wednesday, brings to an end an acrimonious and public war of words between two of the luxury industry’s best known groups. The initial deal ran into trouble last month when Louis Vuitton owner LVMH said it could no longer complete the transaction by a November 24 deadline. It cited a French political intervention asking it to delay completing the acquisition until January 6 because of a threat of new US tariffs on French products, and also decried the jeweller’s “dismal” performance during the coronavirus crisis. Tiffany in return sued LVMH in a Delaware court, seeking to force it to honour the original deal. The case had been scheduled to be heard in early January. However, a source close to the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that Tiffany had recently approached LVMH with a more conciliatory tone.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-250

Covid-19 related disruptions and high prices of the yellow metal have dampened demand, according to the World Gold Council. Although a marginal recovery is expected in the October-December quarter, driven by festive demand, the overall demand for the year is likely to remain under pressure given the current situation and market volatility. Jewellery demand was down 48 per cent in volume terms and 29 per cent in value terms during the quarter. Unlike jewellery, investment demand was up 51 per cent in volume terms and 107 per cent in value terms, representing a shift in consumer preference for bars and coins. “In the third quarter of 2020, gold demand fell 30 per cent because of Covid related disruptions, bleak consumer sentiment, high prices and volatility. This is, however, better than the second quarter where there was a 70 per cent drop. This has been partially because of the easing of lockdown and some low prices in August,” said Somasundaram PR, managing director, India, World Gold Council. “Looking ahead, we typically witness an upswing in gold demand in the fourth quarter on account of Dussehra, Dhanteras and other festivals along with a wedding season post-harvest. This year, a good monsoon notwithstanding, the price and Covid shadow will affect sentiment, though we can reasonably expect at least a part of the pent-up demand to surface,” he said, adding that as weddings and festivities become low key activities, savings on other spend could be channelised into gold. World Gold Council further said global gold demand has dropped 19 per cent to 892 tonnes in the third quarter compared with the year-ago period. This was the lowest quarterly total since the third quarter of 2009. Even as the overall demand declined, the quarter saw significant growth in investment demand, which rose 21 per cent. Investors globally bought 222.1 tonnes of gold bars and coins and an additional 272.5 tonnes through gold-backed ETFs. “Focus right now is on the US presidential elections although increasing virus numbers is again posing a threat to global growth. Market participants will keep an eye on the ECB policy meeting and also on the Q3 GDP data expected from the US, which could keep the volatility high. Broader trends on Comex could be in the range of $1865-1895 and on domestic front prices could hover in the range of Rs 50,120-50,750,” said Navneet Damani, vice-president-commodities research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-250

The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the price of ethanol extracted from sugarcane juice to Rs 62.65 per litre from the current Rs 59.48 per litre for the supply year beginning December 2020. The rate for ethanol from C-heavy molasses has been increased to Rs 45.69 per litre from Rs 43.75 per litre and that of ethanol from B-heavy to Rs 57.61 per litre from Rs 54.27 per litre, I&B minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters here. India, which is 85 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil needs, allows doping of up to 10 per cent ethanol in petrol with a view to cutting oil import and vehicular emissions as also offer a remunerative source for sugarcane farmers to sell their produce. The steady rise in the price of ethanol paid by oil marketing companies has led to ethanol procurement jump to 195 crore litres in 2019-20 (December 2019 to November 2020) from 38 crore litres in 2013-14. Oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd will bear the GST and transportation cost on the ethanol procured for doping in petrol, he said. Jute packaging The government has extended the norms for mandatory packaging of 100 per cent food grains and 20 per cent sugar in diversified jute bags.

The country’s largest car maker posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,419.6 crore in the July-September period against Rs 1,391 crore a year ago on the back of higher sales. In the previous April-July quarter, the company had reported its first quarterly loss since listing in 2003 after the coronavirus-led lockdown stopped sales. However, the company missed analysts’ profit estimates in the second quarter as the carmaker was hit by higher costs of raw materials and tax expenses. Maruti, which sells every second car in the country, saw an 18.6 per cent jump in domestic car sales to 370,619 units. But total expenses rose 7.8 per cent and tax expenses spiked 76 per cent.

Various guarantors had challenged in different high courts an IBC provision relating to personal guarantors of loans to insolvent companies on the ground that they cannot be fastened with the liability for the repayment of debt that promoters have failed to repay. One of the petitions has been filed by Anil Ambani in the Delhi High Court. In view of the multiple petitions filed before different high courts which may throw conflicting judgments, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) through additional solicitor-general Madhavi Divan had approached the apex court to transfer all the cases before the different high courts to itself for  obtaining a clarity on the issue. However, several petitioners before the high courts had opposed the transfer plea of the board. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta representing the Centre also urged the apex court to lay down the law on the issue. Allowing the board’s appeal, a three-judge bench of Justices L.

30-10-2020||Business||Shapoorji Pallonji Group submits Tata separation plan in Supreme Court||The Shapoorji Pallonji Group (SP Group) has submitted a separation plan to the Supreme Court that will sever its 70-year-old ties with Tata Sons. The estranged 18.37 per cent minority shareholder in the holding company of the $113 billion Tata group is, however, seeking a pro-rata shareholding in 16 listed Tata entities along with a share of the Tata brand value. It has also asked for an independent, third-party valuation of the 31 unlisted companies in which Tata Sons holds a stake. In all, the Mistrys are seeking a payout of Rs 1.75 lakh crore in lieu of their minority stake in Tata Sons. The Tata group has not commented on the separation plan proposed by the SP Group. After its bitter four-year legal battle with the Tatas in the wake of the ouster of Cyrus P. Mistry from his position as the chairman of Tata Sons, the Mistrys last month said they wanted to exit Tata Sons. In a statement on Thursday, the SP Group said that it has formally sought separation from the Tatas in the Supreme Court. It added that Tata Sons is effectively a two-group company, with the Tata group comprising Tata Trusts, Tata family members and Tata companies holding around 81.6 per cent of the equity share capital, and the Mistry family owning the balance 18.37 per cent. The Mistry family has proposed that the dispute over valuation can be eliminated by doing a pro-rata split of listed assets and a pro-rata share of the Tata brand. As part of the non-cash settlement, the Mistry group is eyeing a stake in listed Tata group firms linked to its holding in Tata Sons. For instance, while Tata Sons holds 72.05 per share in Tata Consultancy Services, the SP Group’s ownership of 18.37 per cent would mean a 13 per share shareholding of TCS. At the current market prices, this would translate to over Rs 1.30 lakh crore. The Mistrys said that for the unlisted companies, an expedited valuation can be done with a valuer selected by both sides and this can be settled in cash or in listed securities. In its affidavit filed with the top court, the SP Group has said that the valuation should be determined by a competent expert and both parties should have the same right of access to information about the company. It suggested a “selective reduction” of capital by extinguishing the shares of Tata Sons held by the minority shareholders and swapping them with the shares of listed firms. The SP Group observed that the key benefits of its separation scheme against a buyout is that there will be no valuation dispute since the price of the main assets (listed companies) price is quoted daily and the brand has already been valued by Tata Sons. Further, Tata Sons would continue as the promoters of group companies and enjoy a control premium on its shareholding. “In case, Tata group does not want to dilute its stake in certain companies, the SP Group could either accept the value in either cash or in TCS stock’’ it added. Experts point out that there could be complications . For instance, there are cross-holdings within the Tata group with even some of the unlisted firms (categorised as promoter) holding stake in some of the listed companies. For instance, Tata Steel and Tata Power hold a small equity stake in TCS. If the Mistry family is allotted shares of these two companies and TCS, the possibility of its effective holding in Tata Sons going above 18.37 per cent cannot be ruled out. If there is a proportionate separation of assets, barring TCS, the stake of the Mistry family would be less than 10 per cent, the analysts said. But the Mistry family said in its affidavit that in a proportionate separation of assets, barring TCS, their stake would be less than 10 per cent. It further pointed out that the scheme of separation that it has proposed through reduction of capital with consideration paid through shares in underlying listed firms could also be used to provide much needed liquidity to other Tata group companies, thereby unlocking value in them.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-251
