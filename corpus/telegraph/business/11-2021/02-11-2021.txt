The 30-share index ended 109.40 points or 0.18 per cent lower at 60,029.06. The broader NSE Nifty fell by 40.70 points or 0.23 per cent to 17,888.95. Tata Steel was the top loser in the Sensex pack, shedding around 3 per cent, followed by Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech, IndusInd Bank and Reliance Industries. On the other hand, Maruti, NTPC, Titan, SBI and L&T were among the gainers. "Succumbing to lacklustre global sentiments, domestic indices failed to gain ground oscillating between gains and losses in a rough session, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. Global markets remain jittery ahead of the upcoming Bank of England and Fed meetings where the central banks could cease the pandemic-era stimulus, he added. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo ended with losses, while Seoul was positive. Stock exchanges in Europe were largely trading with gains in mid-session deals.

02-11-2021||Business||Sensex surges over 200 points in early trade||Equity benchmark Sensex jumped over 200 points in early trade on Tuesday led by gains in index majors TCS, Maruti and Bajaj Finance amid a largely positive trend in global markets. The 30-share index was trading 228.13 points or 0.38 per cent higher at 60,366.59 in initial deals. Similarly, the Nifty rose 73.50 points or 0.41 per cent to 18,003.15. NTPC was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rising around 3 per cent, followed by Maruti, PowerGrid, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, HUL and Titan. On the other hand, Sun Pharma, IndusInd Bank, Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel and Kotak Bank were among the laggards. In the previous session, the 30-share index ended 831.53 points or 1.40 per cent higher at 60,138.46, and Nifty rose 258 points or 1.46 per cent to 17,929.65. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital market, as they offloaded shares worth Rs 202.13 crore on Monday, as per exchange data. "The 258-point surge in Nifty on Monday, despite massive sustained selling by FIIs for several days, has again proved that FII selling can impact the market only in the short run," said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. Retail and DII enthusiasm is getting fundamental support from positive economic data like record GST collections (Rs 1.3 lakh crore in October), PMI at 55.9 in October and better-than-expected Q2 results, he stated. Further, an important event that can influence financial markets globally is the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting starting later in the day. "The Fed is widely expected to announce tapering its bond buying program starting this month. More important than the tapering announcement, which is already discounted by markets, will be the Fed's response to inflation and the likely cues on rate hikes. "If indications of an earlier-than-expected rate hike come from the FOMC meeting, that can be negative for markets. Otherwise, markets may continue to be resilient," Vijayakumar said. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai and Tokyo were trading with losses in mid-session deals, while Hong Kong and Seoul were positive. Stock exchanges in the US also ended with gains in the overnight session. Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude rose 0.15 per cent to USD 84.84 per barrel.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-93
02-11-2021||Business||Steel players increase prices by Rs 1,500-3,500 a tonne from Nov 1||Indian steel companies have raised prices across different grades of the alloy by Rs 1,500-3,500 a tonne from November 1. Following the hike, which comes on the back of hardening raw material costs, especially coking coal which all domestic companies mostly import, hot rolled (HR) prices are in the range of Rs 70,000 a tonne. The increase had a rub-off effect on steel stocks which outperformed the benchmark indices by a wide margin. Sources confirmed that JSW Steel and Tata Steel, the country’s top two private steel makers, had raised prices for November both for the flat category, which goes into consumer durables and cars, and the long segment, which finds uses in the construction sector. The latest round of hike comes after a brief period of lull during July-September. Steelmakers had intermittently raised prices in October both in the long (rebar) and  flat steel (hot rolled and cold rolled coils) categories. In October, flat steel prices went up Rs 1,500-Rs 3,000 a tonne, while longs were increased Rs 3,000 a tonne, led by higher coal prices and healthy demand, Crisil Research said in a note on October 18, 2021. The rising costs have come on account of a spike in coking coal prices, a key ingredient for blast furnace based integrated steel makers, which has tripled to $400 a tonne FOB (free-on-board) Australia. Despite the spate of hikes, Indian prices remain at a discount vis-a-vis United States and Europe but on a par with Asia, indicating domestic manufacturers will still be competitive vis-a-vis imports. The multiple rounds of price hikes will contribute to an inflationary trend with user industries passing on the impact to the end consumer. Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) and public sector Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) had a good day in the market, gaining as much as 2.9 per cent to 8.9 per cent, respectively, as price hikes add shine to the metal. In contrast, the benchmark Sensex went up 1.41 per cent. Gas cylinder Ahead of Diwali, state-owned oil firms have increased LPG prices by Rs 265 to over Rs 2,000 per gas cylinder used by commercial establishments. However, there was no change in domestic cooking gas prices In Calcutta, a 19-kg cylinder now costs Rs 2,073.50. Petrol and diesel prices also went up for the sixth consecutive day on November 1. The refiners have also raised jet fuel prices for the first half of November by 4.6 percent compared with the previous fortnight to Rs 79,020 per kl, marking the fourth consecutive fortnightly increase. Coal output State-owned Coal India Limited on Monday said  production increased 6.4 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) to 49.8 million tonnes in October. The development assumes significance in the wake of the country's power plants facing fuel shortages.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-93

02-11-2021||Business||Petroleum ministry asks ONGC to give up 60% stake of Mumbai High||The petroleum ministry has told ONGC to give away a 60 per cent stake plus operating control in India’s largest oil and gas producing fields of Mumbai High and Bassein to foreign companies, according to an October 28 letter to the state-owned company. Amar Nath, additional secretary (exploration) in the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, wrote a 3-page letter to ONGC chairman and managing director Subhash Kumar, saying productivity of the Mumbai High and Bassein & Satellite (B&S) offshore assets under the state-owned firm was low and international partners should be invited and given 60 per cent participating interest (PI) and operatorship. This is the second time since April that Nath, who is part of the ONGC management as the longest-serving government nominee director on its board and often considered a potential candidate to replace Kumar next year, has written an official letter, painting a poor picture of the company’s performance. According to the October 28 letter, reviewed by PTI, he said the redevelopment projects will raise recovery of the mature and continuously declining Mumbai High field from 28 per cent to 32 per cent, “which is quite low”. “The field has substantial potential to contribute to domestic production,” he said adding the infrastructure such as pipelines and platforms on the fields are “ageing and leaking and need replacement/revamping”. “ONGC will, however, find this challenging as its improvement/development projects have lagged behind schedule. Procedural aspects and other constraints will not encourage ONGC to take quick decisions,” he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-93

The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, compiled by IHS Markit, jumped to 55.9 in October from September’s 53.7, the highest since February, and remained above the 50-level separating growth from contraction for the  fourth straight month.

Analysts had expected the homegrown auto major to post losses in the region of Rs 3,500-4,400 crore. The poor performance came as the company faced the twin headwinds of a global semi-conductor shortage and firm raw material prices. During the April-June 2021 period, Tata Motors had clocked a consolidated loss of Rs 4,450.92 crore. Consolidated revenues of the company, however, rose to Rs 60,436 crore from Rs 52,839 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. During the quarter, revenues at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) stood at around £3.9 billion from £4.35 billion in the same period of the previous year. The subsidiary recorded a pre-tax loss of £302 million  compared with a loss of £110 million in the preceding three months. Retail sales (including the China joint venture) were at 92,710 vehicles, down 18.4 per cent due to the semiconductor shortage and lower retailer inventories. Retail sales were lower year-on year in most regions, including North America where it fell 15.6 per cent, China by 6.3 per cent, Europe by 17 per cent, and in the UK by almost 48 per cent. On the path ahead, JLR said the semiconductor shortage remains dynamic and difficult to forecast. It, however, expects to see gradual recovery starting in the second half of this financial year. “While supply remains constrained, JLR will continue to take mitigating actions, including prioritising the production of higher margin vehicles for the available supply of semiconductors and closely managing costs to bring down the break-even point for the business. Further, JLR is taking measures to increase the future visibility and control over semiconductor supply for its vehicles.’’||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-93

02-11-2021||Business||Ex-SBI chairman arrested in alleged loan scam case ||In a development that has sent shock waves through the banking industry, former State Bank chairman Pratip Chaudhuri was arrested in an alleged loan scam case related to a hotel in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan. Chaudhuri, the SBI chief between April 2011 and September 2013 is now an independent director on the boards of CESC, Firstsource, Spencer’s Retail, Cosmo Films, Visa Steel and Muthoot Finance. He was reportedly arrested by the Jaisalmer Sadar police from his home in the national capital after his bail application was rejected by a magistrate’s court in Jaisalmer. The case relates to the properties owned by the Godawan group which had taken a loan from the SBI in 2008 to build a hotel. However, the account became a non-performing asset (NPA) in June 2010 after which SBI took steps to recover the money. It sold properties belonging to the group to Alchemist Asset Reconstruction Company during Chaudhuri’s tenure at the bank. The ARC is sponsored by Alok Dhir, a chartered accountant and an NBFC called DMI Finance Pvt Ltd. The Godawan group then approached the courts alleging that the market value of the properties was much higher at Rs 160 crore. Their value at present is reportedly put at Rs 200 crore. Chaudhuri had joined the board of directors of Alchemist following his retirement from SBI. In a statement issued on Monday, SBI said “Garh Rajwada” was the hotel project in Jaisalmer that was financed by the lender in 2007. The project remained incomplete for over three years and the key promoter passed away in April 2010. The account slipped into NPA in June 2010 and various steps taken by the bank for the completion of the project as well as the recovery of its dues did not yield the desired results. SBI disclosed that as part of its recovery efforts, the dues were assigned to an ARC for recovery in March 2014. SBI pointed out the sale to the ARC was done through a laid down process at the bank and the assignment to ARC was completed in March 2014.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-94

The highest GST collection of Rs 1.41 lakh crore was recorded in April 2021. This is the fourth time in a row the  collection was higher than Rs 1 lakh crore. The collections were 24 per cent higher than October 2020 and up 36 per cent more than  October 2019, which was before the pandemic. Abhishek Jain, tax partner, EY India, said: “The robust GST collections are quite encouraging and a clear sign of economic recovery. With the ongoing festive season, we can expect similar or even higher GST collections in the coming months.” Gross GST revenue collected in October 2021 was Rs 1,30,127 crore of which central GST was Rs 23,861 crore, state GST Rs 30,421 crore, integrated GST Rs 67,361 crore, including Rs 32,998 crore collected on the import of goods, and cess Rs 8,484 crore, including Rs 699 crore collected on the import of goods. M.S. Mani, senior director, Deloitte India, said: “The impressive GST collections have resulted from a combination of sustained economic growth and continuing policy initiatives to improve compliance and discourage evasion… Going forward, we may see more checks and balances being introduced to encourage filers and dissuade non-filers.” Aditi Nayar, chief economist, Icra, said: “With the October 2021 GST e-way bills expected to exceed the level seen in the previous month, the headline GST collections are slated to remain healthy in a range of Rs 1.25-1.35 lakh crore in November. “Overall, we expect the Central GST collections to exceed the Centre’s budget estimate of Rs. 5.3 lakh crore by up to Rs 50,000 crore.” She said the compensation cess collections have been hit by the semiconductor problem that has affected cars. However, with Rs 60,000 crore collected in the first seven months, the target for the fiscal was likely to be met. “Higher GST collections and revenue buoyancy of other taxes will be more than enough to bridge the receipt shortfall, which could emerge from less than budgeted disinvestment proceeds,” Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist, India Ratings and Research. The finance ministry statement said the taxmen at the central and state levels have ensured greater compliance which have resulted in improved collections. The GST Council has also voted for steps to ease compliance such a zero filing through SMS text. The council has taken various steps to discourage non-compliant behaviour such as  the blocking of e-way bills for the non-filing of returns, system-based suspension of registration of taxpayers who have failed to file six returns in a row and blocking of credit for return defaulters.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-94

Venkatakrishnan is taking over as the CEO of Barclays —  the first time an Indian will take charge of a British bank. Venkatakrishnan will replace Jes Staley who is stepping down after UK’s financial regulator ordered an investigation into the latter’s relationship with disgraced American financier Jeffrey Epstein. Venkatakrishnan, or Venkat as he is known in banking circles, will join Anshu Jain at Deutsche Bank and Vikram Pandit at Citibank in an elite club of Indians who rose to the pinnacle  of global banking. Pandit was the former CEO of Citigroup, while Jain was the co CEO of Deutsche Bank between 2012 and 2015. Prior to his appointment as group CEO, Venkat was the head of global markets, co-president of Barclays Bank plc and a member of the group executive committee based in New York. He was also the chief risk officer at the bank. According to the Barclays website, before joining the bank in 2016, he worked at JP Morgan Chase from 1994, holding senior roles in asset management where he was chief investment officer managing  around $200 billion in global fixed income . He holds a doctorate from MIT. In a regulatory filing, Barclays said that it was made aware on Friday evening of the preliminary conclusions of investigations done by UK regulators Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority into the relationship between Staley and the late Jeffrey Epstein. It added that while Staley will contest the findings of the investigation, the board and the former CEO have agreed that he will step down from his role as group chief executive and as a director of Barclays. Barclays said Venkatakrishnan will take over as the group chief executive with effect from November 1, 2021, subject to regulatory approval, and as a director. “The board has had succession planning in hand for some time, including reviewing potential external appointees, and identified Venkat as its preferred candidate for this role over a year ago, as a result of which he moved from the position of group chief risk officer to head of global markets,” Barclays said. “The board has long been confident in Venkat’s capabilities to run the Barclays Group and is delighted to have such a strong internal candidate. The board is confident that Barclays under his leadership will continue its strategic direction and improve performance in line with the progress of recent years.’’ Venkatakrishnan will receive a fixed pay of £2.7 million, delivered 50 per cent in cash paid monthly and 50 per cent delivered in Barclays shares. The shares, Barclays disclosed, will be delivered quarterly and subject to a holding period with restrictions lifting over five years. He will also receive a cash payment in lieu of pension of £135,000 per annum. Staley woes The relationship between Staley and Epstein dates back to Staley’s tenure as the head of private banking at JPMorgan Chase. Staley used Epstein — who killed himself in 2019 after facing new allegations of sex trafficking of underage girls — to connect with potential clients. Barclays said the investigation of Staley did not make any findings that Staley “saw, or was aware of, any of Epstein’s alleged crimes” and that it was “disappointed” with the outcome. The two regulators declined to provide any details about what their inquiry against Staley had found saying in a joint statement that they “do not comment on ongoing investigations or regulatory proceeding”. Barclays said the investigation focused on how  Staley had characterised his relationship with Epstein to the board and the subsequent description of the relationship in Barclays’ response to the Financial Conduct Authority.
