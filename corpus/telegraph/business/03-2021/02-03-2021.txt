02-03-2021||Business||Cooking gas prices increase by Rs 25 per cylinder, fourth hike in a month’s time||Cooking gas prices were on Monday hiked by Rs 25 per cylinder across all categories, including subsidised fuel — the fourth increase in rates in a month's time. The new price in Calcutta is Rs 845.50 per cylinder, a hike of 45 per cent in just 10 months since May. And given the fact that crude price remains elevated with the possibility that Opec+ summit later this week deciding on production cuts which will act as a ballast to prices, LPG prices will shoot above Rs 1,000 a cylinder — bang in the middle of the state elections given the current trend lines of Rs 100 a month hike. Unless of course, the government steps in and asks the oil refiners to stop passing on the hike or hold them until after the elections. However, oil ministry sources indicated that no such directive has gone out as yet. Gas prices have been raised four times in the past one month, including Monday's hike. The first hike was on February 4 by Rs 25, followed by an increase of Rs 50 on February 15 and then another Rs 25-hike on February 25. The prices have been constantly increasing since December and cumulatively there has been a hike of Rs 175 per cylinder. Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has suggested the prices have increased “due to intense cold” and a recent ice storm in the US had generated the spike in the price of diesel and petrol. But the Opposition remains unconvinced. Jet fuel prices on Monday were hiked by a steep 6.5 per cent on the back of a rally in international oil prices. Meanwhile, aviation turbine fuel or ATF price was hiked Rs 3,663 per kilolitre, or 6.5 per cent, to Rs 59,400.91 per kl in the national capital. Petrol sales Indian state refiners’ daily petrol sales in February rose by 1.5 per cent from a year earlier, its slowest pace of growth in six months, preliminary industry data showed, as record-high retail prices hit consumption. State refiners’ daily diesel sales, which are related closely to economic growth and account for about 40 per cent of overall refined fuel sales in India, fell 5.3 per cent in February, the largest decline in three months, the data showed. Petrol and diesel prices have risen to record highs, mirroring global markets. Taxes account for about 61 per cent of petrol prices and about 56 per cent of diesel prices. State fuel retailers sold 2.22 million tonnes of petrol and 5.81 million tonnes of diesel last month, the data provided by an industry source showed. State companies Indian Oil Corp, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Bharat Petroleum own about 90 per cent of India’s retail fuel outlets. Rising diesel and petrol prices could push up inflation, making it harder for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to continue its accommodative monetary policy.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-121
02-03-2021||Business||Sensex surges 750 points as investors cheer positive return of domestic economy ||Positive news ranging from the domestic economy returning to growth and better auto sales to the cooling down of US bond yields saw the benchmark Sensex surging nearly 750 points and the Nifty gaining over 232 points on Monday. The gains came on a day the country began its next phase of vaccination even as encouraging data came in on the GST front. Experts are of the view that while equity prices could witness an upward momentum, factors like rising number of Covid-19 cases could affect the rally. In Monday’s trading, the 30-share index opened in the green at 49747.71 and touched an intra-day high of 50058.42. Subsequently, it ended at 49849.84, showing a rise of 749.85 points or 1.53 per cent. Similarly, the Nifty ended with a gain of 232.40 points or 1.60 per cent at 14,761.55. Another glitch The NSE and BSE on Monday said all their operations are functioning in a normal manner after HDFC Securities flagged that confirmations were not received for orders placed in the NSE cash segment due to a “technical glitch”. After mentioning about the technical glitch in a tweet at 10.01am, HDFC Securities, at around 11.53am, released a statement saying the issue "got resolved at 9.50 am" and that investigation is going on to find out the root cause.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-122
02-03-2021||Business||Government receives Rs 77,146 cr bids on Day 1 of spectrum auction||The Centre earned Rs 77,146 crore on the first day of the spectrum auction on Monday from sales in five of the seven bands on offer against the floor price of Rs 45,000 crore. As much as 60 per cent of the 2250Mhz spectrum in the 800Mhz, 900Mhz, 1800Mhz, 2100Mhz and 2,300MHz bands got sold on the first day of the auction — the first since 2016. But there were no takers for the coveted 700Mhz band and the 2500Mhz band, which explains why the collections are still far off from expected revenues of Rs 3.92 lakh crore from the sales. “The 700 MHz and 2500 Mhz saw no bids today (Tuesday). The auction will resume tomorrow morning... leaving aside the 700Mhz and 2500 MHz bands, 60 per cent of the spectrum in the other five bands put on sale was sold,” telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. Unlike in 2016 where there were seven bidders, there are only three now — Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea. On Monday, 65 per cent of the 800Mhz spectrum were sold. In 900Mhz, bids were received for 38 per cent of spectrum. The biggest sale took place in 2300Mhz, where 89 per cent of the spectrum was sold. In the 1800Mhz band, 41 per cent of the spectrum was sold, but just 9 per cent of the airwaves in 2100Mhz band found buyers. About one-third of the spectrum being auctioned this time is in the 700 Mhz band, which was completely unsold during the 2016 auctions. Analysts said operators were unlikely to diversify into a new spectrum band that would require incremental investment in equipment on their part , when other sub-GHz bands are available at lower prices. The current auction does not include frequencies in 3,300-3,600 MHz bands that were identified for 5G services, which will happen later. “We should be coming with an eco-system for 5G trials very soon. We will be sharing more details at an appropriate time for 5G auctions,” Prasad said. Telecom secretary Anshul Prakash said the Union government was expecting revenues of about Rs 7,000 crore this fiscal and around Rs 12,000-13,000 crore in the next fiscal.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-122

The collection in the previous month was Rs 1.19 lakh crore. Collections crossed Rs 1 lakh crore for the fifth month in a row in February, which the finance ministry said was an indication of economic recovery. The gross GST revenue collected in February 2021 is Rs 1,13,143 crore, of which CGST is Rs 21,092 crore, SGST is Rs 27,273 crore, IGST is Rs 55,253 crore (including Rs 24,382 crore collected on import of goods) and cess is Rs 9,525 crore (including Rs 660 crore collected on import of goods). “In line with the trend of recovery in the GST revenues over past five months, the revenues for the month of February 2021 are 7 per cent higher than the GST revenues in the same month last year. “During the month, revenues from import of goods were 15 per cent higher and the revenues from the domestic transaction (including import of services) were 5 per cent higher than the revenues from these sources during the same month last year,” the ministry said in a statement. M.S. Mani, senior director, Deloitte India, said: “In addition to the stabilisation of economic activities, the continuing trend of high GST collections for the past few months is also on account of the data analytics approach adopted by the authorities, which has led to significant detection of evasion and incorrect ITC (input tax credit) availment. With the gradual opening up of the services sectors, economic activity is expected to pick up.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-122
02-03-2021||Business||Birla Corporation’s board of directors approve Arvind Pathak as CEO||Birla Corporation on Monday announced a change in its management with the board of directors of the company approving the appointment of Arvind Pathak as the managing director and CEO for a period of three years effective from March 31, 2021. The mantle of CEO passes from current wholetime director and CEO Pracheta Majumdar, a veteran in the company. He has been re-designated as wholetime director and chief management adviser of the company effective from March 31, 2021. In a statement to the bourses, the company said that Pathak has experience of 36 years in the cement industry having held the CEO or equivalent positions for over 14 years in various large organisations which include ACC, DCP, Adani and Reliance ADAG group. He holds a degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University), Varanasi and a postgraduate degree in industrial engineering and management. “The aforesaid appointment is subject to approval of the shareholders at the next general meeting of the company,” Birla Corporation said in a statement to the bourses. The scrips of the company at Rs 866.40 were up 2 per cent over the previous close on the BSE. The rejig in the board comes amid the ongoing legal tussle over the control of the company and the MP Birla group to which it belongs. The company, however, has seen a strong third quarter posting an 82 per cent jump in net profit on the back of growth in sales volume, aggressive cost rationalisation and high sale of premium products. A focus for the new CEO would be on navigating the expansion projects of the cement major which is aiming to achieve a capacity of 25 million tonnes by 2025. This includes the construction of the Company’s 3.9 mt cement plant at Mukutban in Maharashtra which is expected to be commissioned in the third quarter of next fiscal year. The company is also planning to scale up incremental clinker capacity at Chanderia in Rajasthan in the first quarter of the next fiscal year. Birla Corporation and its subsidiary, RCCPL Private Limited (the erstwhile Reliance Cement Company Private Limited), have 10 cement plants spread across the country, with an annual installed capacity of 15.5 million tons.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-122
02-03-2021||Business||Directors must pass dual test: Sebi||The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is proposing to give a greater say to minority shareholders in the appointment, re-appointment and in the removal of independent directors. In a consultation paper, the market regulator tightened the norms with regard to the resignation of the independent directors on the grounds of personal reasons or other commitments by suggesting a cooling off period of one year before the directors can join another board. Similar cooling off period has been proposed if the directors are elevated to a position such as   a whole-time director in the same company. It also mooted the grant of long-vesting ESOPs to the independent directors in lieu of cash-based commissions. The appointment and the re-appointment of the independent directors shall be subject to dual approval — the approval of the shareholders and the approval by “majority of the minority” (simple majority) shareholders. Minority shareholders mean shareholders, other than the promoter and promoter group. If either of the approval thresholds are not met, the person would have failed to get appointed or re-appointed. In such a case, the listed entity may either propose a new candidate or propose the same person for a second vote of all shareholders,without a separate requirement of approval by “majority of the minority”, after a cooling-off period of 90 days but within a period of 120 days. The removal of the directors will also be subject to the dual approval process. Further, if a casual vacancy arises because of resignation, removal or the death of an independent director, the approval of shareholders should be taken within a time period of three months. Sebi said that considering the importance of the audit committee with regard to related party transactions and financial matters, it should comprise two-third independent directors and one-third non-executive directors who are not related to the promoter, including nominee directors, if any. “While some these suggestions may increase the compliance burden, Sebi’s move will help broad-base corporate governance norms in Indian entities. These moves have the capacity to increase the independent oversight of Indian listed entities,” Arka Mookerjee, partner, J. Sagar Associates, said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-122
02-03-2021||Business||Amit Mitra claims 23 lakh jobs created in Bengal during April-January||The Trinamul Congress has countered BJP’s claim that Bengal suffers from a lack of industrialisation and joblessness by touting numbers thrown up from bank lending to small- and medium-scale industries. Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra claimed that 23 lakh jobs have been created during April-January of this year going by the matrix followed by the BJP government at the Centre. BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, have been relentless in their attack on the TMC government led by Mamata Banerjee seeking to make a perceived lack of opportunity for educated youth of the state as a poll plank in the upcoming Assembly elections. PM Modi especially chose the closed Dunlop tyre factory at Sahagunj, Hooghly, as the venue for his last public rally to raise the issue of industrialisation under the decade-long Mamata regime. BJP alleged the young generation in Bengal is being forced to leave the state because of lack of opportunity. Countering the claim, Mitra tweeted this morning: “Mo-Shah’s negative propaganda on investment in Bengal BUSTED by 100 Bankers in Meet. Banks in Bengal lent Rs 63,000 crore for investment to Medium - Small industry, April 2020 - January 21, with the state government’s support. Result: 23 lakh new jobs as per GoI capital/labour ratio. Mo-Shah bolun (please answer Mo-Shah)?” Later in the evening, Mitra explained that he used a conservative yardstick to measure new job creation in the state. “The Centre now takes a multiple of 44 new jobs for every crore of investment compared with 36 it used to in the past. I have taken the latter. Going by the matrix used by Modi’s government, Bengal has created this many jobs, even though I think the number may be even higher.” Bengal ranks second among states to have the highest number of micro, small and medium enterprises, cornering 14 per cent share, just behind Uttar Pradesh. The state had 88.67 lakh MSMEs as on March 31, 2020 according to the Centre. Mitra said bank lending facilitated by state level banking committee stood at Rs 63,000 crore as on January 31. He had set a target of Rs 90,000 crore lending for the full year before Covid happened. “I am still hopeful. The numbers will surprise us on the upside,” he said. In a meeting with industry in February, Mitra had said the lending may touch Rs 70,000 crore-Rs 75,000 crore.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-122

The new rates are based on the loan amount and the credit score of the borrower and are available till March 31, the country’s largest lender said in a statement on Monday. SBI said the rates will start from 6.70 per cent for loans up to Rs 75 lakh and 6.75 per cent for loans in the range of Rs 75 lakh to Rs 5 crore.
