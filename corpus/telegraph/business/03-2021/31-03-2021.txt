The 30-share BSE index ended 627.43 points or 1.25 per cent lower at 49,509.15, and the broader NSE Nifty slumped 154.40 points or 1.04 per cent to 14,690.70. The HDFC duo was the top laggard in the Sensex pack, shedding nearly 4 per cent, followed by PowerGrid, Tech Mahindra, ICICI Bank, ONGC, Kotak Bank, Asian Paints, Infosys and Reliance Industries. On the other hand, ITC, Bajaj Finserv, HUL, SBI and TCS were among the gainers. "Domestic equities traded lower as concerns pertaining to spike in COVID-19 cases and resultant restrictions continued to weigh on investors' sentiments, said Binod Modi, Head - Strategy at Reliance Securities. Further, rise in US treasury yields and strengthening dollar index aggravated concerns, he added. Financials, especially private banks, witnessed heavy profit booking, which along with selling pressure in IT stocks dragged benchmarks. However, investors continue to lap up FMCG, metals and pharma names. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo ended in the red. Stock exchanges in Europe were also trading on a negative note in mid-session deals. Meanwhile, the global oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 0.58 per cent lower at USD 63.80 per barrel.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-94
31-03-2021||Business||Sensex tanks over 400 points in early trade||Equity benchmark Sensex tumbled over 400 points in early trade on Wednesday, dragged by losses in index majors HDFC twins, Infosys and ICICI Bank amid a negative trend in global markets. The 30-share BSE index was trading 440.84 points or 0.88 per cent lower at 49,695.74, and the broader NSE Nifty dropped 116.05 points or 0.78 per cent to 14,729.05. The HDFC duo was the top laggard in the Sensex pack, shedding over 2 per cent, followed by Tech Mahindra, PowerGrid, ICICI Bank, Infosys and Kotak Bank. On the other hand, Bajaj Finserv, Reliance Industries, NTPC, Sun Pharma, Axis Bank and Maruti were among the gainers. In the previous session, Sensex ended 1,128.08 points or 2.30 per cent higher at 50,136.58, and Nifty settled at a nearly two-week high of 14,845.10. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net buyers in the capital market as they purchased shares worth Rs 769.47 crore on Tuesday, as per exchange data. Domestic equities do not look to be good at the moment. The recent announcements of night curfews by various state governments and indication of lockdown by Maharashtra authorities certainly do not augur well for equities, said Binod Modi, Head - Strategy at Reliance Securities. He further noted that the strengthening dollar index, which already gained 1.5 per cent last week and surpassed 93 levels so far this week, can aggravate investors' concern in emerging markets including India. US equities ended lower as concerns of rising bond yields and higher inflation once again weighed on investors' sentiments, Modi added. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo were in the red in mid-session deals, while Seoul was trading marginally higher. Meanwhile, the global oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 0.45 per cent higher at USD 64.46 per barrel.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-94

The company has full confidence on its position and “as previously advised, Cairn will continue to take all steps necessary to protect the interests of its shareholders”, Cairn said. The firm has moved courts in nine countries to get the arbitral award registered and recognised. Once the court recognises an arbitration award, the company can petition it to seize any Indian government asset such as bank accounts, payments to state-owned entities, aeroplanes and ships in those jurisdictions, to recover the amount due to it. It said the award is binding on the parties under the terms of the Treaty and UNCITRAL arbitration rules, and it is enforceable internationally under the 1958 New York Convention. An international tribunal in December had unanimously ruled that India violated its obligations under the UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty in 2014, when the income tax department had slapped a Rs 10,247-crore tax assessment using legislation that gave it powers to levy taxes retrospectively. India had lost another major international case against Vodafone over a $2 billion retrospective tax dispute. The government has challenged the verdict in the Vodafone case. After losing a Supreme Court case against levying tax on capital gains made in the 2007 sale by Hutchison of its India business to Vodafone for $11.2 billion, the government had in 2012 enacted a legislation that gave it powers to tax such deals retrospectively. Thereafter the tax department said Vodafone should have withheld tax on the deal and issued a notice seeking Rs 11,218 crore, later augmented by Rs 7,900 crore in penalties. In January 2014, the department assessed that Cairn too made an alleged capital gain on reorganising its India business prior to an IPO in 2006-07 and sought Rs 10,247 crore in taxes. But unlike Vodafone where no enforcement action was taken, it seized and sold Cairn's residual stake in the India unit, confiscated dividends due from such holding, and stopped tax refund due to it.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-94

We apologise for the inconvenience and request you to try again after sometime. Thank you,” HDFC Bank said in a tweet. Later in the evening, the private sector bank said that the issue faced by some of the customers has been resolved. “We apologise for the inconvenience caused and thank you for your patience,’’ the bank added. This is not for the first time that the customers of HDFC Bank have faced service outage.The  bank has been penalised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for two major outages previously. In December 2020, the banking regulator temporarily barred HDFC Bank from launching new digital banking initiatives and issuing credit cards after taking a serious view of service outages at the lender over the last two years RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said in December the regulator had some concerns about certain deficiencies and it was necessary that HDFC Bank strengthens its IT system before expanding further. “We cannot have thousands and lakhs of customers who are using digital banking to be in any kind of difficulty for hours together... Public confidence in digital banking has to be maintained,” Das had said. The bank has been classified as systematically important by the RBI. HDFC Bank, the largest lender by assets in the private sector, has been classified as a systemically important entity by the RBI in the past. It is also the largest issuer of credit cards and has a significant share in the payment processing segment.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-95

The hotel in the heart of the capital was the pet project of India’s first PM Jawaharlal Nehru and built in time for the country to host the UNESCO meet in 1956. Sources said a core group of secretaries have finalised a plan to offer the property on lease for 60 years along with developing a 22-acre adjacent land to set up a market complex and service apartments. However, Ashok's twin, Hotel Samrat, will continue to be run by India Tourism Development Corp. (ITDC) because of its proximity to the Prime Minister’s residence, a sensitive location that demands high security. The NITI Aayog had suggested leasing out the hotel to private business players. The divestment department predicted the government could get Rs 7,500 crore from the monetisation of its hotel assets. In its plan to lease out the hotel property, the inter-ministerial group has allowed commercial opportunities to flourish in the land, provided they follow the required security measures. Doors shut Apart from putting the hotel on lease, ITDC has shut down many of its hotels in various states because of  losses incurred in the last few years. Some of those properties include Hotel Janpath in Delhi, Hotel Jammu Ashok in Jammu and Hotel Kalinga Ashok in Bhubaneswar. Several attempts have been made in the past to sell the hotel run by the ITDC but the plans had to be abandoned due to a string of factors including labour issues, dues and past contracts that the iconic hotel had signed.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-95

Finance ministry officials said the Union cabinet was expected to consider a note on IDBI privatisation, which is apart from the two banks to be put on sale in the next fiscal. The cabinet is expected to deliberate on the amount of the stake to be sold by the government and the biggest promoter Life Insurance Corporation. Sources have indicated that the government and Life Insurance Corp will look to sell their stakes in the bank. While the government owns about 45.28 per cent stake in the bank, LIC, the largest  promoter,  holds 49.24 per cent. LIC was brought in when the bank was in trouble, but now the government considers the phase is over. The bank was taken out of the RBI's prompt corrective action framework that imposes restrictions on the operations of banks whose bad loans exceed 25 per cent of assets. Officials said the roadshows to sell the bank could begin by the end of next month immediately after the Cabinet approval. The government is open to foreign players bidding to take management control in the bank.. The government allows maximum foreign direct investment (FDI) of 74 per cent in private banks, while it allows 20 per cent in PSU banks under the government approval route. The amendment to the Industrial Development Bank (Transfer of Undertaking and Repeal) Act, 2003 in the Finance Bill 2021 would enable it to be deemed to have obtained a (Banking) license under Section 22 of Banking Regulation Act, which would boost its sale prospects. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the budget for 2020-21 has set a target to raise Rs 2.1 lakh crore from the privatisation and sale of minority stakes in state-owned companies. This includes Rs 1.20 lakh crore from selling a stake in CPSEs and Rs 90,000 crore from stake sale in financial institutions. So far this fiscal, the government has collected Rs 19,499 crore through minority stake sale in CPSEs and share buybacks. The board of the bank last week has approved a plan to raise Rs 8,000 crore in rupee bonds. IDBI Bank's managing director and CEO Rakesh Sharma had said the bank would  now look to grow its business in a calibrated way with more focus on profitability and in improving efficiency ratios. According to a regulatory filing by the bank to the stock exchanges, the money would be borrowed in one or more tranches during financial year 2021-22. The bank has also won approval to issue additional tier-I bonds and infrastructure bonds. The share price of the bank on the BSE moved up 1.44 per cent to Rs 38.65 on Tuesday.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-95

He added, "although I will no longer be able to influence the direction of governance of the Tata group directly, I hope that the issues I have raised will cause deeper reflection and influence individuals concerned to catalyse change. I sleep with a clear conscience’’. Defending his performance at the Tata group when he was the chairman, he said that over the last four years, he had the ``opportunity to reflect on my actions and on whether I could have handled the generational change in leadership better. In hindsight, while I may have had many imperfections, I have no doubt or erosion of conviction about the direction I chose, the integrity behind my actions and their consequences," he noted.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-95

The proposal is now before the K.V. Kamath-led RBI panel for its approval. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in August last year had said the Kamath panel will vet all resolution plans of entities hit by the vagaries of the coronavirus-induced lockdown and having exposures of at least Rs 1,500 crore. Care Ratings has given an RP4 rating for the restructuring plan of the SP group, the minimum rating required by an entity keen on a resolution and whose exposure is over Rs 100 crore. The RBI had mandated that entities keen on a recast must get itself rated by at least one credit rating agency. According to the recast plan, the SP group will not have to make principal payments for two years while the interest payments will be suspended till September this year. However, there is no relief on the interest rate and the  group will have to pay the previously agreed rate set with the lenders. The group owes a little over Rs 22,000 crore, but under this package loans worth Rs 10,900 crore will be restructured. The SP group had earlier told the lenders that it was also looking at asset sales in various arms of the group such as  Eureka Forbes, Sterling & Wilson Solar and Afcons Infrastructure which are expected to be completed in the next fiscal. It is also learnt that promoter borrowings of around Rs 2,700 crore will be converted into perpetual debt to lessen the burden. The development comes just days after the Supreme Court upheld the sacking of Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of Tata Sons back in 2016 by the board. Last week, a bench of Chief Justice S.A. Bobde and justices A.S. Bopanna and V. Ramasubramanian said it was allowing the appeals filed by Tata Group. The court said, “all the questions of law are liable to be answered in favour of the appellants Tata Group and the appeals filed by the Tata Group are liable to be allowed and those by Shapoorji Pallonji Group are liable to be dismissed”.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-95

The markets were weighed down by the spike in coronavirus cases in India that has raised the spectre of another lockdown. However, hopes of a global economic recovery with the vaccination rollout gathering speed and the end of the Suez Canal blockage that was feared to have an adverse impact on certain commodities led to stocks gaining in Europe and Asia — with a positive spinoff in India. Analysts said the attention in India will now be on the vaccination drive which will be extended to more number of people from the next month and the upcoming results season. There is an optimism that corporate India will continue to report good numbers for the quarter ended March 31, 2021.
