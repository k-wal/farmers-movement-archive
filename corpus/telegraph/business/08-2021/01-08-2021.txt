In July 2020, power consumption stood at 112.14 BU, lower than 116.48 BU in the same month of 2019 (pre-pandemic level). Thus, consumption of power has not only grown year-on-year but also returned to pre-pandemic level. Experts say recovery in power demand and consumption in July 2021 is mainly due to delayed monsoon and surge in economic activities amid easing of lockdown restrictions by states. They said power demand as well as consumption returned to pre-Covid levels in July and a strong recovery is expected in coming months. The commercial and industrial power demand and consumption got affected April onwards this year due to lockdown restrictions imposed by states. Experts said that amid decline in the number of daily Covid-19 positive cases across the country and easing of lockdown restriction by the states, the commercial and industrial demand for power would definitely rise from July onwards. Peak power demand met or the highest supply in a day touched an all-time high of 200.57 GW in July (recorded on July 7, 2021). Daily power consumption also touched an all-time high of 4,508 million units on July 7, 2021. Peak power demand met for the entire month of July 2020 was 170.40 GW. Therefore, peak power demand met recorded growth of nearly 18 per cent in July 2021, compared to 170.40 GW (recorded on July 2, 2020). The peak power demand met was recorded at 175.12 GW in July 2019. Last year, the government had imposed a lockdown on March 25, to contain the spread of coronavirus. The lockdown was eased in a phased manner, but it had hit the economic and commercial activities and resulted in lower commercial and industrial demand for electricity in the country. Power consumption in April 2021 saw year-on-year growth of nearly 38.5 per cent. The second wave of Covid-19 started in the middle of April this year and affected the recovery in commercial and industrial power demand as states started imposing restrictions in the latter part of the month. Power consumption in the country witnessed 6.6 per cent year-on-year growth in May at 108.80 BU despite a low base of 102.08 BU in the same month of 2020. As per the latest data, power consumption in June grew nearly 9 per cent to 114.48 BU, compared to 105.08 BU in the same month last year. Power consumption in February this year was recorded at 103.25 BU, compared to 103.81 BU a year ago. In March this year, power consumption grew nearly 22 per cent to 120.63 BU, compared to 98.95 BU in the same month of 2020. After a gap of six months, power consumption had recorded 4.6 per cent year-on-year growth in September 2020, and 11.6 per cent in October 2020. In November, power consumption growth slowed to 3.12 per cent, mainly due to early onset of winters. In December, it grew 4.5 per cent, while this was 4.4 per cent higher in January 2021.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-123

At present, the processing fee on home loans is 0.40 per cent while it stands at 50-100 basis points of the loan amount for most of the other lenders. The latest relaxation is part of its limited period “Monsoon Dhamaka Offer”. The country’s largest lender claimed that in availing the scheme, a home loan customer can gain substantially and that it will also help revive consumer sentiments. “There could not be a better time to buy a house, considering SBI home loan interest rates start at just 6.70 per cent,” SBI said in a statement. The Monsoon Dhamaka Offer is for a limited period ending August 31, 2021, it added. Observers said the offer was another attempt by the state-owned lender to improve its market share in the competitive home loan segment, particularly at a time credit to industry is sluggish. The SBI’s move comes ahead of the three-day monetary policy committee meeting that is set to begin on August 4. However, the RBI is largely expected to retain the policy rate and its accommodative stance given the patchy economic recovery. “This offer of processing fee waiver will facilitate and encourage home buyers to take a decision with ease, as the interest rate is at its historic low. We strive to be a banker to every Indian and, thereby, be partners in nation building,” C.S. Setty, MD (retail and digital banking), SBI, said. There will be a concession of five basis points for home loans applied through the bank’s YONO app. Women borrowers will also be eligible for a concession of five basis points on the card rate which starts from 6.80 per cent. Data from the central bank on the sectoral deployment of bank credit showed credit growth to industry contracted 0.3 per cent in June 2021 from a 2.2 per cent growth in June last year. Housing loans showed a rise of 9.8 per cent.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-123

Addressing students of Ashoka University virtually, he mentioned that globalisation has brought overall prosperity in emerging economies and has increased wages and income inequality. “Globalisation has tripled Indian GDP in a generation, an amazing accomplishment...but the workers of India have been left out,” Maskin, a professor of Economics and Mathematics at Harvard University, said. Noting that the rise of inequality in so many developing countries is surprising, he said inequality cannot be solved by market forces. “Yet, India will still be facing some huge challenges, challenges that may be even harder to solve than the pandemic....the problem of increasing income inequality,” he noted. Maskin said even though the world has witnessed enormous economic growth in the last 25 years, the gap between the haves and have-nots in developing countries has risen.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-123

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) eased to 50.4 in July from 50.9 in June, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Saturday, but remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. Analysts had expected it to slip to 50.8. It was the lowest figure since the index slumped to 35.7 in February 2020, after China began lockdowns to control the coronavirus pandemic. An NBS official said in a statement the PMI’s sub-index for production slipped to 51.0 from 51.9 in June, pointing to equipment maintenance and extreme weather. The new order sub-index fell to 50.9, from 51.5, reflecting a slowdown in demand. “The most alarming signal is the new export order index, which is at the lowest level since July last year,” said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist of Pinpoint Asset Management. The sub-index for new export orders has dropped for three straight months starting in May. It stood at 47.7 in July. A sub-index for raw material costs stood at 62.9 in July compared with June’s 61.2, pointing to an increase in costs. High raw material prices have eaten into the profitability of industrial firms and deterred some Chinese exporters from taking on orders. Authorities are eager to prevent high factory-gate prices being passed on to consumers, which would only add to current economic headaches as underlying demand remains weak. Hit by extreme weather, the construction index dropped to 57.5, from June’s 60.1.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-123
