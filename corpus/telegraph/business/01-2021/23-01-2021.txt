In his letter, Mitra has urged her to relax the FRBM limits by at least 2 per cent in 2021-22 so that states can use the full headroom for borrowing granted by the Centre. The Modi government had raised the borrowing limit for states by 5 per cent as part of its Atma Nirbhar Bharat package of measures. Borrowings up to 4 per cent were freely allowed but an additional 1 per cent came with reform-driven conditions, which Mitra says limits the fiscal space of states. Mitra said in his letter that the states have been allowed to dip into the State Disaster Relief Fund up to 50 per cent to meet Covid-related expenses but the corpus is just Rs 1,100 crore. “The state would need Rs 11,387 crore to tackle Covid-19 for 2020-21,” the letter said. Mitra said Bengal has spent Rs 4,000 crore to combat Covid-19 but has received only Rs 279 crore in grants from the Centre. Release of pending allotments under centrally sponsored schemes was also in the letter. The estimated amount is Rs 32,494.67 crore under various schemes. Mitra has also called for re-evaluation of the ongoing central schemes and making sufficient allocation for maintenance as well as for costs towards manpower. Mitra also noted that the Centre must borrow the remaining Rs 72,000 crore to meet the shortfall in GST compensation cess collection and lend it on to the states. Out of the Rs 1.82 lakh crore estimated GST compensation gap, the Centre is borrowing Rs 1.10 lakh crore through an RBI special window, Mitra pointed out. Bengal had also asked for relief worth Rs 35,000 crore for cyclone Amphan, of which only Rs 2,250 crore has been given. “The balance amount must be provided to the state expeditiously,” Mitra said. He further said that the Centre must end the shortfall in tax devolution. The state has received only Rs 27,943.70 crore against dues of Rs 37,904.50 crore till December end, Mitra said in the letter. The letter is in the wake of a pre-budget consultative meeting with the state finance ministers.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-162

The petroleum ministry, which has held inter-ministerial consultations on setting up a transport service operator (TSO), would send a formal proposal to the cabinet soon and the issue would be taken before the end of this fiscal. Officials said the operator would be put in place to manage the common carrier part of the gas pipeline infrastructure. The TSO will be entrusted with the task of booking pipeline capacity for transport of gas from producers to the consumers on payment of a fee to be decided by the regulator. After the bifurcation of the operations of GAIL into gas transportation and marketing, the former may be put under an independent TSO. Adani stake in IGX Adani Total Gas and Torrent Gas have become the first strategic investors in IGX (Indian Gas Exchange) by acquiring a 5 per cent stake each for Rs 3.69 crore.

23-01-2021||Business||Bid to regulate top NBFCs like banks||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday proposed a four-layered regulatory structure for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) with a progressive increase in the intensity of regulation leading to the upper  layer where the top 25-30 entities will be subject to tighter regulations akin to banks. According to a discussion paper released by the RBI, the NBFCs will be split into four layers — base, middle, upper and top — similar to a pyramid. However, the RBI did not propose any reserve requirements such as cash reserve ratio (CRR) or statutory liquidity ratio (SLR). The base layer will have the least regulation. The RBI proposed higher entry point norms in terms of net owned funds (NOF). A five-year timeline will be given to the NBFCs to achieve this rule. Bad loan classification will be changed to 90 days from 180 days . The next is NBFC-ML (middle layer) where regulations will be a little more strict. These include both deposit and non deposit taking NBFCs classified as systemically important apart from housing finance companies. However, the top 25-30 NBFCs in the country which fall into the upper layer (NBFC-UL) will see several regulatory changes. These are non-banks which are identified as systemically significant. They will be subject to differential provisioning on standard assets against a flat rate of 0.40 per cent at present. A significant change is that Core Equity Tier -1 which is now applicable for banks will be implemented here. This has been proposed at 9  per cent. Finally, there is the top layer. Ideally, this layer will remain empty unless supervisors take a view on specific NBFCs. If certain NBFCs lying in the upper layer are seen to pose extreme risks according to supervisory judgement, they can be put to significantly higher and regulatory requirements.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-162

Market experts are guiding for more volatile days in the days ahead, though they admit that in the long-run, the bull run remains intact. The Sensex had on Thursday hit the 50000 mark for the first time aided by strong portfolio inflows and on positive vibes from Joe Biden taking charge as the US President. However, the persistent run-up in stock values had set the stage for moderation. On Friday, global developments were also not conducive for sustaining the benchmark index’s run above the 50000 mark. There was disappointing data from the Eurozone, news from China of more infections amid apprehensions of more lockdowns elsewhere. “Virus worries were front and centre with Asian stocks falling, as a spike in Chinese infections sparked testing of millions in Beijing,” said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research, HDFC Securities. “European stocks dropped on rising Covid-19 cases and lockdown worries globally. Optimism surrounding a leadership change at the White House ran out of steam. Data also showed the flash Eurozone purchasing managers index dropping in January to a two-month low of 47.5, coming close to the expected 47.6 — from 49.1 in December. “UK retail sales only grew 0.3 per cent in December, weaker than expected, marking a weak end to their worst year on record,’’ he said. Back home, analysts say that good results from companies are now largely factored into the prices and the key event to watch out for is the Union budget and that stocks will be volatile ahead of February 1. In Friday’s trade, the Sensex could not sustain at higher levels as investors sold the RIL stock ahead of its third quarter results, while banking and finance counters also witnessed heavy selling. After opening marginally lower at 49594.95, the 30-share Sensex hit an intra-day low of 48832.08 and finished at 48878.54 — a fall of 746.22 points or 1.50 per cent over its last close.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-162

The oil-to-telecom conglomerate recorded a net profit of Rs 13,101 crore compared with Rs 11,640 crore in the same period of the previous year. Analysts were expecting RIL to post profits in the region of Rs 11,000 crore. Its performance was led by the digital services segment, even as the O2C division, which contributes almost 67 per cent to overall revenues saw a sequential 10 per cent growth in its topline to Rs 83,838 crore. But, on a year-on-year basis, there was a sharp drop from Rs 119,121 crore as the business is yet to fully revive from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the star of the show was Jio Platforms (Jio), which houses its digital services business. Jio saw its profits rising 15.5 per cent over the second quarter of 2020 to Rs 3,489 crore from Rs 3,020 crore, while revenue from operations rose 5.3 per cent to Rs 19,475 crore during the same period. EBITDA margins were also higher by 50 basis points at 43.6 per cent. Average revenue per user (ARPU) during the quarter came as a pleasant surprised at Rs 151 per subscriber per month against Rs 145 per subscriber per month in the trailing quarter. Analysts had expected Jio to post an ARPU of Rs 148 during the quarter. RIL said total customer gross addition in the digital services division was robust at 25.1 million. On the O2C business, the sequential revenue push came largely on account of higher volumes in transportation fuels, purified terephtalic acid and polyester supported by improved product realisation across polymers, fibre intermediates and polyester. RIL said polymer margins were at a record high while margins for intermediates were sequentially better. It added that restraints on public transport and increased preference for personal vehicles improved demand for personal mobility fuels like gasoline and diesel. However, the performance of its retail business disappointed with revenues falling almost 10 per cent on a sequential basis to Rs 33,018 crore from Rs 36,566 crore.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-162
