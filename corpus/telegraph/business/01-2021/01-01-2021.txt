01-01-2021||Business||GST collections crosses all-time high in December||GST collections touched a record high of over Rs 1.15 lakh crore in December, reflecting festive demand and reflating economy. The gross GST revenue collected in the month of December 2020 is Rs 1,15,174 crore and is the highest since the introduction of Goods and Services Tax from July 1, 2017, the Finance Ministry said in a statement. "This is the highest growth in monthly revenues for the last 21 months. This has been due to combined effect of the rapid economic recovery post-pandemic and the nation-wide drive against GST evaders and fake bills along with many systemic changes introduced recently, which have led to improved compliance," the Finance Ministry said in a statement. The total number of GSTR-3B Returns filed for the month of November up to 31st December 2020 is 87 lakh. During the month, revenues from import of goods were 27 per cent higher and the revenues from domestic transaction (including import of services) are 8 per cent higher than the revenues from these sources during the same month last year. In line with the recent trend of recovery in the GST revenues, the mop-up in December crossed Rs 1 lakh crore mark for the third month in a row and was 12 per cent higher than over Rs 1.03 lakh crore collected in December 2019. During December Central GST mop-up is Rs 21,365 crore, State GST is Rs 27,804 crore, Integrated GST is Rs 57,426 crore (including Rs 27,050 crore collected on import of goods) and Cess is Rs 8,579 crore (including Rs 971 crore collected on import of goods). The government has settled Rs 23,276 crore to CGST and Rs 17,681 crore to SGST from IGST as regular settlement. The total revenue earned by the Central Government and the State Governments after regular settlement in the month of December is Rs 44,641 crore for CGST and Rs 45,485 crore for the SGST.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-184

Britain said earlier this month it would use its new-found freedom outside the European Union to diverge from a common EU trade policy towards the United States, deciding to unilaterally suspend tariffs relating to a 16-year dispute on aircraft subsidies. The US government on Wednesday said it would raise tariffs on certain EU products, including aircraft components and wines from France and Germany, arguing that the EU had unfairly calculated its own tariffs. “The UK wasn’t hit because we suspended tariffs and brought the US to the negotiating table,” a British official said. “(This) shows we are making the right strategic decisions,” he added. The United States and the EU have already imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of each others’ goods over a row about state subsidies provided to civil aviation firms Boeing and Airbus. Those tariffs remain in place. British trade minister Liz Truss has repeatedly spoken out against the measures, earlier rounds of which have hit British exports such as Scotch whisky. Germany has also recently called for a quick resolution to the dispute. The British decision to suspend tariffs on US goods from January 1, once Britain fully leaves the EU, upset European planemaker Airbus and exposed a growing rift between the UK and Europe over aerospace investment, industry sources and analysts said.

The finance ministry has notified such dealers in precious metals and stones and also real estate agents with over Rs 20 lakh turnover under the ambit of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Nangia & Co LLP director Mayank Arora said the amendment notifying dealers in precious metals and stones aims to plug the loophole wherein cash transactions up to Rs 2 lakh without KYC — PAN and Aadhaar —  were allowed in the gems and jewellery sector. “This amendment classifies such dealers as reporting entities and such dealers would have to maintain records of all cash transactions cumulatively in excess of Rs 10 lakh with a customer,” Arora said. He said real estate agents are considered as a reporting entity under the PMLA, 2002. “Recent amendment to the Prevention of Money Laundering Rules, 2005 has appointed the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs as the Regulator, responsible for specifying procedure and manner of maintaining records by real estate agents,” Arora added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-184

At the end of the first quarter, the outstanding total debt of the government stood at Rs 101.3 lakh crore. The 5.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter increase reflects pressure on revenue collection and rising expenditure because of the Covid-19 crisis. Public debt accounted for 91.1 per cent of total outstanding liabilities at end-September 2020, according to the latest quarterly report on public debt management. The weighted average yield on primary issuances of dated securities showed further moderation to 5.80 per cent in the second quarter of 2020-21 from 5.85 per cent in the first quarter, it said. During the second quarter, 13 tranches of auctions were held for the issuance of dated securities aggregating to Rs 4,20,000 crore, which was slightly more than the pre-announced calendar because of exercising of greenshoe option. The Union government’s fiscal deficit soared to Rs 10.75 lakh crore, or 135.1 per cent of the 2020-21 budget estimates (BE), at the end of November 2020, mainly on account of low realisation of revenue due to disruption in business activities amid the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-184

The tribunal issued a corrigendum on Wednesday to its December 28 order saying “the critical remarks were due to a typo”. The corrigendum issued by president of the tribunal P. P. Bhatt and vice-president Pramod Kumar clarified the first order made certain “inadvertent references to Mistry because of a few typo errors’’. In its observations on Mistry, the tribunal said one fact that it had inadvertently missed out was that the information furnished by the former chairman of Tata Sons was in response to a notice from the assessing officer. “The above corrections will have no impact on the outcome of the appeal and the outcome of the appeal remains the same,” the tribunal added. The Mistry family has welcomed the suo motu retraction. “We note that the income tax appellate tribunal has issued a corrigendum on its own, to correct the wild personal allegations made against Mistry that formed part of its December 28 order, in a proceeding where Mistry was not even a party,” the Mistry family said in a statement. The ITAT had on December 28 upheld the tax-exempt status of Ratan Tata Trust, JRD Tata Trust and Dorabji Tata Trust, which owns 66 per cent of Tata Sons. It had said that the March 2019 I-T revision order cancelling tax exemption to these trusts was “devoid of any legally sustainable merits”. The ITAT had said in its order that Mistry had sent material against the trusts to the tax department within eight weeks of his removal as Tata Sons chairman. “The inputs from those engaged in a rivalry with an assessee should be taken with a reasonable degree of circumspection and should not be placed on such a high pedestal so as to relegate all other material facts and accepted past assessment history of the case into insignificance,” the tribunal had said in its order. In its corrigendum the tribunal said “some inadvertent errors have crept in the order dated December 28… At page 60-61, certain observations were made about Mistry. One fact, which was inadvertently missed out was that the information furnished by Mistry was in response to a notice from assessing officer’’. “The inputs from those engaged in a rivalry with an assessee ought to have been considered by the department with a reasonable degree of circumspection and should not be placed on such a high pedestal so as to relegate all other material facts and accepted past assessment history into insignificance.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-185
01-01-2021||Business||Reliance Jio makes all calls free from January 1, 2021||Reliance Jio, the country’s largest telecom operator, has announced that all domestic voice calls from its network to others will be free from January 1, 2021. This comes as the interconnect usage charges (IUC) regime for domestic voice calls will come to an end. According to the telecom regulator’s directions, a ‘Bill and Keep’ regime is being implemented in the country from January 1, 2021, thereby ending IUC charges for all domestic voice calls, it said in a statement. The telco added that the latest announcement follows its commitment to revert off-net domestic voice-call charges to zero as soon as the IUC charges are abolished. Off-net calls refer to calls that terminate in other operators’ networks “Jio will once again make all off-net domestic voice calls free, starting January 1 2021. On-net domestic voice calls have always been free on the Jio network,” it added. Call termination charges, or interconnect usage charge (IUC), is a fee paid by one operator to another when its customers make outgoing calls to the other operator’s customers. Jio, which had stormed the market with its free voice calls and cheap data tariffs, had in October last year said it will be charging customers 6 paise per minute for voice calls made to rival networks and that it took this step because of “regulatory uncertainty” over call termination charges to the network of its rivals that were supposed to end in January 2020. The company added that when Trai extended the timeline for implementation of the ‘Bill & Keep’ regime beyond January 1, it was left with no option but to start charging its customers for offnet voice calls at a rate exactly equivalent to the applicable IUC charge. Its announcement comes at a time the ongoing farmers protest has seen it receiving several port-out requests. The latest step could lead to some moderation in the number of customers opting out from its network. In a recent letter to Trai, Jio, however, alleged that industry peers Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL) were running “vicious and divisive campaign” against it and making claims that migrating Jio mobile numbers to their networks would be an act of support to farmers’ protests. In October, it added 2.22 million mobile customers, taking its total subscriber base to 406.35 million. The addition number was, however, lower than that of Airtel, which added 3.67 million new customers in that month. Jio had an average revenue per user (ARPU) of Rs 145 per subscriber per month during the second quarter ended September 30, 2020 as compared to Rs 140.3 in the preceding quarter.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-185

Though the benchmark indices ended on a flat note, the New Year mood remained ebullient on the hopes of a global economic recovery and the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine. Investors are also expecting strong growth in earnings, favourable policies in the budget and more importantly central banks continuing to pursue accommodative policies, which could see liquidity chasing riskier assets. The Sensex ended with gains of 15.7 per cent and the Nifty 14.9 per cent for the year — much less than the 43 per cent gain of Nasdaq and 43 per cent of Korea’s Kospi though they did rise 60 per cent from their March lows. Analyst said the year had an important lesson for investors —  equities may be volatile, but they remain a rewarding asset class. The Covid-19 pandemic lorded over market sentiments even as it led to major changes in which companies conducted their business, while it floored several sectors such as aviation and hospitality. However, with the unlocking of economies worldwide and incremental number of cases coming down, the economy began to recover from a record contraction in the first quarter. Though the pandemic affected various sectors, it brought good tidings to  pharmaceuticals, IT and telecom. Pharma and tech stocks emerged as investors’ favourite with the Nifty Pharma gaining almost 61 per cent and the Nifty IT almost 55 per cent. Some stocks were in rarefied territory such as Tanla Platforms which rose 2,281 per cent or Adani Green trading almost 834 per cent higher than its 52-week low in March. In 2021, the focus will be on the economy and how inflation pans out. Attention will also be on the budget which reports indicate will boost spending. However, with several segments of the market having seen a sharp upmove, the next area of interest could be industries that could benefit from the economic recovery. “After a tumultuous 2020, we expect 2021 to look markedly different on the growth front. We remain constructive on the GDP growth trend. We expect a still accommodative monetary policy stance to support the recovery and structural reforms to lift medium-term growth prospects,” a note from Axis Mutual Fund has said. The Sensex opened modestly higher on Thursday at 47753.11 and witnessed volatility to hit the day’s high of 47896.97 and a low of 47602.12. It later closed 5.11 points higher or 0.01 per cent to its new closing record of 47751.33. The broader NSE Nifty crossed the 14000 level for the first time, touching a record intra-day peak of 14024.85. The 50-issue index pared gains to close at 13981.75, down just 0.20 points. HDFC was the leading gainer among the Sensex stocks on Thursday, rising 1.65 per cent. TCS was the biggest loser, shedding 1.33 per cent. “As we enter 2021, the market is sitting on an all-time high and is showing resilience on the back of abundant liquidity, positive developments on the vaccine front and signs of economic recovery,” Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research, Motilal Oswal, said. “We expect Nifty earnings to remain flattish in 2020-21 while expecting a sharp rebound in 2021-22. Thus, the overall structure of the market remains positive. With the economic activity continuing its recovery, it could lead to start of earnings upgrade cycle,” Khemka said. However, intermittent corrections cannot be ruled out as there is a risk of a second wave of Covid-19 and thus sustenance of economic recovery holds the key, he said. "From next 12 months perspective, we are positive on IT, BFSI, Healthcare, Telecom, Auto and Consumer” Khemka said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-185
