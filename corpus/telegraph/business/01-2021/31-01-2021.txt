31-01-2021||Business||Kishore Biyani tells off Amazon||Future Group promoter & CEO Kishore Biyani has hit out at Amazon.com Inc, alleging that the retail giant was playing the “dog in the manger” and that its only objective was to create confusion about the Future Group’s Rs 24,173-crore deal with Reliance Industries. Biyani also termed Amazon’s attempt to stall the deal as a “ruthless ambition to scorch the earth akin to the Greek Alexander”. Biyani made these charges in a letter to Future Group employees and it comes after Amazon took legal steps to block the deal. Recently, it has filed a petition in the Delhi high court seeking detention of the group founders, including Biyani, and seizure of their assets. Biyani said he was writing the message as over the last few weeks, he had received numerous queries on the various legal steps being taken by Amazon. He alleged in the letter that Amazon was running a concerted and coordinated media campaign and leaking misleading information. “This is a corporate battle and is being fought for supremacy over Indian customers. Immense resources are being deployed on influencing society’s mindset and belief systems,” he said. Justifying the deal with Reliance, Biyani said because of financial crisis during the  pandemic, it was left with no other option but to enter in a ‘constructive deal’ with the Mukesh D Ambani led entity.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-155

The exporters claim India could lose its market for engineering items to other countries of the southeastern region unless the government makes the available steel cheaper or releases funds which are part of the incentive scheme. “Exporters have not been able to apply for MEIS (Merchandise Export from India Scheme) licences for exports done from April to December 31. This delay has caused huge cash flow problems, especially for MSME exporters, as they had factored in the amount at the time of quoting. The government should immediately issue MEIS to give relief,” Sanjay Budhia, managing director of Patton, one of the leading exporters out of Bengal, said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-155

The segment is also expecting a clear roadmap on production-linked initiatives (PLIs). Further, it wants the government to continue investments on infrastructure and the rural economy that managed to pull the country out of the Covid crisis. Credit rating agency Icra feels the PLI scheme announced by the government has the potential to kick-start significant investments in the automotive industry.
