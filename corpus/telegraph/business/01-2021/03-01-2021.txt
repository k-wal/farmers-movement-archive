The NYSE said on Thursday that it would delist China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom following President Donald Trump’s move in November to bar US investment in 31 firms that Washington says are owned by the Chinese military. “This kind of abuse of national security to suppress Chinese firms does not comply with market rules,” it said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-182

The government had made it mandatory for businesses with a turnover of over Rs 500 crore to generate electronic invoice for B2B transactions from October 1, 2020. The IT ministry on Saturday said the GST e-invoice system has completed three months and facilitated the smooth transition of the tax payers to the new platform. It has enabled more than 37,000 taxpayers to generate more than 16.80 crore invoice reference numbers (IRNs) during the last three months. “Starting with 495 lakh (4.95 crore) during October 2020, generation of e-invoice has increased to 589 lakh (5.89 crore) in November 2020 and 603 lakh (6.03 crore) in December 2020,” it said. The e-way bill generation from the National Informatics Centre was also the highest during September to December 2020 compared with corresponding months of the previous years. “There have been errors such as repeated requests on the same document number, requests with validation or calculation errors, which were corrected by the help desk,” it said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-182
03-01-2021||Business||India's trade deficit widens to $15.7bn||India’s trade deficit has widened to $15.71 billion in December as imports grew 7.6 per cent to $42.6 billion and exports contracted 0.8 per cent to $26.89 billion, according to preliminary data released by the commerce ministry on Saturday. “The sharp step up in the value of merchandise imports to $42.6 billion widened the trade deficit to $15.7 billion, the highest level since November 2018. The recovery in imports reinforces our expectation that the current account surplus will deflate to sub-$5 billion in the second half of FY2021,” Aditi Nayar, principal economist with Icra, said. “A marginal decline of just 0.8 per cent in exports is a sign of revival as the order booking position has continuously improved. Besides, more new orders are in the offing,” said FIEO president Sharad Kumar Saraf. “Going ahead by this trend, we expect our inventories to be liquidated, adding to overall demand,” he added. Exports in December 2019 were $27.11 billion, while imports stood at $39.5 billion. In November 2020, the exports were down 8.74 per cent. In December 2020, oil imports declined 10.37 per cent to $9.61 billion. During April-December this fiscal, the imports dipped 44.46 per cent to $53.71 billion. Gold imports surged about $2 billion, an 82 per cent jump from the previous year, while petroleum products saw the biggest decrease for any commodity group in trade into and out of the country, the government said. Overseas shipment of drugs and pharmaceutical products increased in value the most among India’s exports, rising 17 per cent from a year earlier. Nayar said “the Y-o-Y expansion in non-oil exports is enthusing in the light of the restrictions in various major trading partners related to the resurgence of Covid-19 cases. The re-emergence of a Y-o-Y growth in merchandise imports signals a strengthening of the domestic growth impulses, pent-up demand for imported items as well as a rise in commodity prices”. Saraf urged the government to address some of the key issues, including adequate availability of containers, softening of freight charges, the release of the required MEIS (merchandise export from India scheme) benefits and clarity on SEIS (services exports from India scheme) benefits and resolving risky exporters issues. In April-December 2020-21, the country’s merchandise exports contracted 15.8 per cent to $200.55 billion compared with $238.27 billion in the same period of 2019-20. Imports during the nine months of the current fiscal declined 29.08 per cent to $258.29 billion against $364.18 billion in April-December 2019-20. “India is thus a net importer in December 2020, with a trade deficit of $15.71 billion compared with a trade deficit of $12.49 billion, widened by 25.78 per cent,” the ministry said in a statement. Major commodities which have recorded positive growth in exports during the month under review include oil meals (192.60 per cent), iron ore (69.26 per cent), carpet (21.12 per cent), pharmaceuticals (17.44 per cent), spices (17.06 per cent), electronic goods (16.44 per cent), fruits and vegetables (12.82 per cent), and chemicals (10.73 per cent). Sectors that registered negative growth include petroleum products (-40.47 per cent), oil Seeds (-31.80 per cent), leather and leather manufactures (-17.74 per cent), coffee (-16.39 per cent), ready-made garments of all textiles (-15.07 per cent), man-made yarn/fabrics/made-ups (-14.61 per cent), marine products (-14.27 per cent), cashew (-12.04 per cent), plastic and linoleum (-7.43 per cent), and tobacco (-4.95 per cent). The major commodities imported with positive growth in December 2020 include pulses (245.15 per cent), gold (81.82 per cent), vegetable oil (43.50 per cent), chemicals (23.30 per cent), electronic goods (20.90 per cent), machine tools (13.46 per cent), pearls, precious and semi-precious stones (7.81 per cent), and fertilisers (1.42 per cent).||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-182

Listed entity Tata Steel held 51 per cent in Jamshedpur Continuous Annealing and Processing Company Private Ltd (JCAPCPL) and 50 per cent in  Tata BlueScope Steel Private Ltd (TBSPL). These shares are now transferred to the books of Tata Steel Downstream Products Ltd (TSDPL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Steel. The transactions were carried out on a non-cash basis; TSDPL issued shares to Tata Steel as consideration for acquiring the stakes. While Nippon Steel of Japan is the other shareholder in JCAPCPL, BlueScope Steel of Australia is the partner in TBSPL. In a communication to the bourses, Tata Steel informed that the exercise is part of “reorganising the India footprint into four clusters to drive scale, synergies and simplification and to create value for all stakeholders”. In November, the company informed that it would merge Tata Metaliks and Indian Steel and Wire Products to Tata Steel Long Products as part of this exercise. The four verticals Tata Steel proposes to create will be focusing on long products, downstream, mining and services. Tata Steel Long Products Ltd, formerly Tata Sponge Ltd, is the lead entity for long products business. TSDPL, formerly Tata Ryerson Ltd, is the flagship for the downstream activities.

The latest balance sheet shows Tata Steel has invested Rs 689.5 crore in the venture as on March 31, 2020 and booked a loss of Rs 3.49 crore on this account. For the inter-se transfer, the stake was valued at Rs 834 crore. In contrast, TBSPL, which manufactures colour roofing sheets, earned Rs 70.16 crore profit for Tata Steel in the last fiscal. The parent had invested Rs 433 crore in the venture which was set up in 2005. In contrast, TSL’s stake in this profit making JV was valued at Rs 1,411.57 crore, while transferring it to TSDPL. Even though TSDPL remains an unlisted company, it is one of the bigger subsidiaries in the Tata Steel India universe. It has a pan-India presence with 10 steel processing plants and 13 distribution and sales locations. The offerings of TSDPL include slitting, cut-to-length, blanking, corrugation, plate burning, fabrication, component manufacturing and steel intensive products and applications.
