In a circular issued on Friday, the banking regulator said that borrowers who have an exposure of less than Rs 5 crore can open current accounts and also have a cash credit (CC) or overdraft (OD) facility. The central bank had said in a notification in August last year that banks cannot open current accounts for customers who have a CC or an OD facility. It had stipulated that all transactions should be routed through the CC or OD account only. The RBI had also said that a borrower can have a current account with a bank which accounts for at least 10 per cent of his or her total borrowing. Lenders had to freeze thousands of current accounts after this decision. Customers who had CC or OD exposures took to social media to complain that their current accounts were put under debit freeze The RBI on Friday said that on a review and taking into account the feedback provided by the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) and other stakeholders, it has been decided that banks may open current accounts for borrowers who have availed themselves credit facilities in the form of cash credit or overdraft facility from the banking system. For borrowers with an exposure in the banking system of less than Rs 5 crore, there is no restriction on the opening of current accounts or on provision of CC or OD facility . However, the lender will have to obtain an undertaking from these borrowers that they will inform the bank as and when the credit facilities availed by them from the banking system reach Rs 5 crore or more. Above Rs 5-cr rule Borrowers with an exposure of Rs 5 crore or more can maintain current accounts with any one of the banks with which it has CC/OD facility, provided that the bank has at least 10 per cent of the exposure of the banking system to of that borrower. The RBI has given banks time till November 30 to implement the new rules on the current accounts.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-20

Bandhan in the red Bandhan Bank on Friday posted a loss of Rs 3,008.6 crore for the September quarter with the bank aggressively stepping up provisions on stressed assets. Net profit in the year-ago period was Rs 920 crore and in the April-June quarter of 2021 was Rs 373.1 crore.

Exide profit up Exide Industries has posted a 2.4 per cent growth in standalone net profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. Net profit during the quarter was at Rs 234.4 crore compared with Rs 228.8 crore in the corresponding period previous year. Revenue from operations grew 19.5 per cent to Rs 3,290 crore during the second quarter compared with Rs 2,753.4 crore in the corresponding year ago period. The top line growth was driven by strong replacement demand for automotive batteries and easing of Covid induced restrictions from June onwards. Makeshift home offices and data centres drove the demand for UPS batteries in the industrial segment with telecom and power sectors showing signs of demand recovery. "Both automotive and industrial SBUs are seeing demand recovery compared to the same quarter previous year and to the previous quarter of the current year. However, increase in gross profit was restricted due to unprecedented cost inflation of inputs. As an ongoing focus area, sales transformation and cost compression remain the core strategies to improve efficiencies within the company," said Subir Chakraborty, MD and CEO, Exide. The automotive and industrial battery maker said that the divestment of life insurance vertical Exide Life Insurance to HDFC Life Insurance has received the approval of shareholders. While the completion of the transaction is subject to further approvals, Exide estimates the sale is likely to be completed before June 30, 2022. The total consideration of the deal is Rs 6687 crore and will be paid in the form of Rs 726 crore as cash consideration and issuance of 8,70,22,222 shares at a price of Rs 685 per share. Exide scrips at Rs 172.95 were 0.44 per cent up at the Bombay Stock Exchange.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-20

The decision to seek 50 per cent share of the convenience fee was made by the railway ministry. The damage control exercise, however, was undertaken by selloff secretary Tuhin Pandey who tweeted that “the ministry of railways has decided to withdraw the decision on IRCTC convenience fee”. Immediately after the selloff secretary’s tweet, the IRCTC share price which had plunged nearly 30 per cent to a low of Rs 639 on Friday morning rebounded to close the day at Rs 845.70. The stock recovered as market fears about reduced margins disappeared. Analysts had estimated the convenience fee for IRCTC at Rs 740 crore for 2022-23 and Rs 780 crore for 2023-24. Railway ministry sources said IRCTC approached the Railway Board with a desperate plea that its finances, severely hit by the Covid-19 disruptions, would take a massive knock if it had to pay the convenience fee. They said the negative impact of the decision on the share market and played a role in the government’s rollback decision . The ministry’s decision had sent a negative signal on PSU stocks forcing the finance ministry to undertake the damage control act. Pandey said “our clear advice to all the departments has always been that any policy decision with respect to listed PSUs, should be taken with the interest of minority shareholders in mind. The railways has evaluated the pros and cons and withdrawn its decision”.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-21

Stock prices have come under pressure in recent times as corporate earnings have not been able to keep pace with the high expectations. Even as there were concerns of pricey valuations, other factors such as firm commodity prices have affected India Inc’s margins, while a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases overseas has exerted pressure on stocks. Foreign portfolio investors have continued to press sales. Provisional data showed they sold stocks worth Rs 5,143 crore on Friday. So far, in this month, the overseas investors have been net sellers to the tune of Rs 13,550 crore. “FIIs have turned big sellers in equity markets in October. Foreign brokerages like Merril Lynch, UBS and Nomura have downgraded India due to excessive valuations. This might have prompted them to sell on a sustained basis’,’ V.K. Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said. He said three IPOs were expected to raise Rs 30,000 crore from the market.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-21

Das, who is the 25th governor of the RBI, will be the longest serving governor in recent years. “The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has approved the reappointment of Shri Shaktikanta Das, IAS Retd, as Governor, Reserve Bank of India for a period of three years beyond 10.12.2021 or until further orders, whichever is earlier,” a government order issued late Thursday night said. Das, who was earlier the economic affairs secretary, was appointed as the RBI governor on December 11, 2018, for three years following the sudden resignation of  Urjit Patel. Among the previous governors, Bimal Jalan exited just two months short of six years, while Y.V. Reddy and D. Subbarao had five-year terms. Das is the first RBI governor to get an extension after the BJP-led government came to power in 2014. Raghuram Rajan, who had a tenure of three years, was denied extension in 2016. Rahul Bajoria, chief economist at Barclays, said the reappointment signals continuity of monetary policy and greater stability to the government-RBI relations. The three year appointment is slightly longer than the usual two-year extension that has been the norm recently, he said. Das’s term at Mint Street has been an eventful one with the central bank doing the heavylifting to revive the economy,  particularly after Covid-19 . Under his tenure, the RBI has cut the policy repo rate cumulatively by 250 basis points, of which 115 basis points came after the pandemic — a massive 75 basis point cut was announced on March 27, 2020 when the monetary policy committee (MPC) advanced its meeting to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. The RBI has since taken several unconventional measures to lift the economy. During the first six months of this fiscal, liquidity of Rs 2.37 lakh crore was infused through bond purchases, including the G-Sec Acquisition Programme or G-SAP. Earlier this month, Das said the RBI has taken more than 100 measures to respond to the pandemic. The RBI also gave a major relief to retail individuals affected by the pandemic through two loan moratorium schemes. Das also oversaw the resolutions at Yes Bank, Lakshmi Vilas Bank and PMC Bank and referred DHFL and two Srei entities to the NCLT. With the domestic economy on a recovery path, observers say the key challenge will be to bring about the policy normalisation without a hard landing. Many expect the interest rate setting body to first raise the reverse repo in December or latest by February 2022 and follow it up with a repo rate hike.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-21
