The fourth straight day of 35 paise per litre hike sent petrol and diesel rates to record highs across the country.  The price of petrol in Delhi rose to its highest-ever level of Rs 105.84 a litre and Rs 111.77 per litre in Mumbai, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.  In Mumbai, diesel now comes for Rs 102.52 a litre; while in Delhi, it costs Rs 94.57.  With this rise, petrol is now at Rs 100-a-litre mark or more in all state capitals while diesel has touched the 100-mark in over a dozen states. Diesel crossed the Rs 100-a-litre mark in Bengaluru, Daman and Silvassa.  Petrol used in two-wheelers and cars now costs 33 per cent more than the price at which aviation turbine fuel (ATF) is sold to airlines. ATF in Delhi costs Rs 79,020.16 per kilolitre or Rs 79 per litre.  The costliest fuel is in the border town of Ganganagar in Rajasthan where petrol comes for Rs 117.86 a litre and diesel for Rs 105.95.  Since ending of a three-week long hiatus in rate revision in the last week of September, this is the 16th increase in petrol price and the 19th time that diesel rates have gone up.  While petrol price in most of the country is already above Rs 100-a-litre mark, diesel rates have crossed that level in over a dozen states/UT including Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chattisgarh, Bihar, Kerala, Karnataka and Ladakh.  Prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes.  Shedding the modest price change policy, state-owned fuel retailers have since October 6 started passing on the larger incidence of cost to consumers.  This is because the international benchmark Brent crude is trading at USD 84.8 per barrel for the first time in seven years.  A month back, Brent was trading at USD 73.51.  Being a net importer of oil, India prices petrol and diesel at rates equivalent to international prices.  The surge in international oil prices ended a three-week hiatus in rates on September 28 for petrol and September 24 for diesel.  Since then, diesel rates have gone up by Rs 5.95 per litre and petrol price has increased by Rs 4.65.  Prior to that, the petrol price was increased by Rs 11.44 a litre between May 4 and July 17. Diesel rate had gone up by Rs 9.14 during this period.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-34

In September 2019, the shipments were worth Rs 23,491.20 crore. For the April-September period, the shipments surged 134.55 per cent to Rs 1,40,412.94 crore compared with the same period in 2020. The overall gems and jewellery exports stood at Rs 59,864.55 crore during April to September 2020, following Covid related disruptions, GJEPC said on Saturday. In 2019, the overall gems and jewellery exports were at Rs 1,26,461.93 crore during April to September. “With Rs 140,412.94 crore ($18.98 billion) exports during April-September, the sector has already achieved nearly half (46 per cent) of the $41.66 billion exports target set by the government for the sector. The sentiment in the industry is incredibly positive with markets opening up and demand gradually returning to normal,” GJEPC chairman Colin Shah said. Moreover, with the festive season coming up, GJEPC is optimistic of achieving the export target by the end of the financial year, he added.

17-10-2021||Business||Sharp surge in electricity demand in October||India’s electricity demand grew 4.9 per cent during the first half of October, with supply falling short of demand by 1.4 per cent despite a 3.2 per cent rise in coal-fired generation and 30 per cent rise in solar output, a Reuters analysis of government data showed. Increased economic activity after the second wave of the coronavirus has driven up electricity demand, resulting in a supply deficit because of a coal shortage that has forced northern states to cut power this month for up to 14 hours a day. The rapid surge in power demand and high global coal prices have left utilities scampering for coal — India’s dominant source of power generation — despite record supplies from state-run Coal India, a near-monopoly in coal production. Coal’s share in India’s electricity generation jumped to nearly 70 per cent during the first 15 days of October, compared with an average of 66.5 per cent during the whole of September, an analysis of data from federal grid regulator POSOCO showed. Nearly three-fifths of India’s coal-fired capacities currently have coal inventories that would last three days or less, federal power ministry data shows. The average coal inventory held by power plants would last four days, two-thirds lower than an average of 12 days two months ago. The energy hungry nation’s power minister had in early September asked officials to consider diverting coal to power plants with extremely depleted stocks, and reduce inventory targets to 10 days from 14 days, to allow coal to be moved to areas of greatest shortage. Singh had also asked utilities to consider blending imported coal with local fuel to address shortages. A reallocation in coal supplies over the last two months has led to an increase in the number of power plants with 1-3 days of fuel, while the number of power plants with over a week of stock has declined, the power ministry data shows. Still, the number of utilities with no coal left increased to 18 on October 12 from 1 on August 12.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-34
