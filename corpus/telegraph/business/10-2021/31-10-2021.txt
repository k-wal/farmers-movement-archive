Data available from the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) in the Union Ministry of Finance showed excise duty collections during April-September 2021 surging to over Rs 1.71 lakh crore, from Rs 1.28 lakh crore mop-up in the same period of the previous fiscal.  Thanks to a steep hike in excise duty rates, the collection is 79 per cent more than Rs 95,930 crore mop-up in April-September 2019.  In the full 2020-21 fiscal, excise collections were Rs 3.89 lakh crore and in 2019-20, it was Rs 2.39 lakh crore, CGA data showed.  After the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, excise duty is levied only on petrol, diesel, ATF and natural gas. Barring these products, all other goods and services are under the GST regime.  Out of the Rs 2.3 lakh crore excise collection in 2018-19, Rs 35,874 crore was devolved to states, according to the CGA. In the previous 2017-18 fiscal, Rs 71,759 crore was devolution to the states out of a collection of Rs 2.58 lakh crore.  The incremental collection of Rs 42,931 crore in the first six months of the fiscal year 2021-22 (April 2021 to March 2022) is four times the Rs 10,000 crore liability that the government has in the full year towards repayment of oil bonds that were issued by the previous Congress-led UPA government to subsidise fuel.  The bulk of excise duty collection is from the levy on petrol and diesel and with sales picking up with a rebounding economy, the incremental collections in the current year may be over Rs 1 lakh crore when compared with the previous year, industry sources said.  In all, the UPA government had issued Rs 1.34 lakh crore worth of bonds (equivalent to a sovereign commitment to pay in future) to state-owned oil companies to compensate them for selling fuel such as cooking gas LPG, kerosene and diesel at rates below cost.  Of this, Rs 10,000 crore is due to be repaid in the current fiscal, according to the finance ministry.  First, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and then Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had blamed the oil bonds for limiting fiscal space to give relief to people from fuel prices trading at all-time high levels. The bulk of the excise collections come from petrol and diesel on which the Modi government had levied record taxes last year.  Excise duty on petrol was hiked from Rs 19.98 per litre to Rs 32.9 last year to recoup gain arising from international oil prices plunging to multi-year low as pandemic gulped demand. On diesel, the duty is hiked to Rs 31.80.  While international prices have since recovered to USD 85 and demand returned, excise duty has remained at the same level. This has resulted in petrol price soaring above Rs 100-a-litre-mark in all major cities and diesel crossing that level in more than one-and-a-half dozen states.  The total increase in petrol price since the May 5, 2020 decision of the government to raise excise duty to record levels now totals Rs 37.38 per litre. Diesel rates have during this period gone up by Rs 27.98 per litre.  The government had raised excise duty on petrol and diesel to mop up gains that would have otherwise accrued to consumers from international oil prices crashing to as low as USD 19 per barrel.  Petrol and diesel as well as cooking gas and kerosene were sold at subsidised rates during the previous Congress-led UPA government. Instead of paying for the subsidy to bring parity between the artificially suppressed retail selling price and the cost that had soared because of international rates crossing USD 100 per barrel, the then government issued oil bonds totalling Rs 1.34 lakh crore to the state-fuel retailers.  These oil bonds and the interest thereon are being paid now.  Of the Rs 1.34 lakh crore of oil bonds, only Rs 3,500 crore of principal has been paid and the remaining Rs 1.3 lakh crore is due for repayment between this fiscal and 2025-26, according to information made available by the finance ministry.  The government has to repay Rs 10,000 crore this fiscal year (2021-22). Another Rs 31,150 crore is due to be repaid in 2023-24, Rs 52,860.17 crore in the following year and Rs 36,913 crore in 2025-26.  Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Rameswar Teli had in July told Parliament that the Union government's tax collections on petrol and diesel jumped by 88 per cent to Rs 3.35 lakh crore in the year to March 31, 2021 (2020-21 fiscal) from Rs 1.78 lakh crore a year back.  Excise collection in pre-pandemic 2018-19 was Rs 2.13 lakh crore.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-20

The proposals, aimed at promoting green hydrogen as an alternative to the fossil fuels currently used by industries, will be made effective through amendments to India’s 2001 Energy Conservation Act. The proposed amendments would facilitate the development of a carbon market in India and prescribe minimum consumption of renewable energy either as direct consumption or indirect use through grid, the power ministry said in a statement. “This will help in reduction of fossil fuel based energy consumption and carbon emission to the atmosphere,” the statement said. The announcement comes just days after India rejected calls to announce a net zero carbon emissions target and said it was more important for the world to lay out a pathway to reduce such emissions and avert a dangerous rise in global temperatures. India, the world’s third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the United States, is under pressure to announce plans to become carbon neutral by mid-century or thereabouts at next week’s climate conference in Glasgow. But environment secretary R.P.Gupta told reporters that announcing net zero was not the solution to the climate crisis.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-20

The market regulator shot off a two-page warning letter to the Anil Agarwal-led company. According to Sebi’s directions, Vedanta placed the letter before its board of directors on Friday and also informed the stock exchanges about the regulator’s rap. Sebi said it would take action if it detected similar irregularities in future transactions. “The aforesaid non-compliances are viewed seriously. You are hereby warned and advised to ensure compliance with all applicable provisions of Sebi Regulations. Any such aberration in future would be viewed seriously and appropriate action would be initiated,” Sebi said. In the firm’s annual report for the year ended 2020-21, the independent auditor for the mining conglomerate had flagged the related-party transactions that were executed without prior approval of its audit committee. “With regard to the qualified opinion in respect of the company executing related party transactions worth Rs 1,407 crore without prior approval of the audit committee, the company has submitted that the said transaction was ratified later (after a period of about 47 days),” Sebi said in the October 28 letter. Without disclosing the nature of the transaction, the company said it was done at an arm’s length and in the ordinary course of business. “In this regard, attention may be drawn to Regulation 23(2) of Sebi (LODR) Regulations, 2015, which states that all related party transactions shall require prior approval of the audit committee,’’ the market regulator said. “Accordingly, the submission of the company that the transactions were done at an arm’s length distance is not tenable,” it added. Regarding the auditor’s observation about the delay in the disclosure of the outcome of the board meeting held on October 3 last year, the company said the delay was due to unforeseen circumstances and it would ensure that this was not repeated. Vedanta said in the filing that at a meeting held on October 29, the board of directors took note of the Sebi letter. The board "has advised the company to ensure adherence to all applicable provisions," it said. "We would also like to state that the company has always been meticulous in complying with all the provisions of the Companies Act and SEBI Regulations and will continue to do so," Vedanta said. Shares of Vedanta ended with gains of almost 1 per cent at Rs 303.70 in the BSE on Friday.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-20

Sequentially, net profit was higher than the Rs 5,941.37 crore earned in the April-June quarter. Officials said the flat net profit was largely due to lower inventory gains in the second quarter. In Q2 last year, the company had large inventory gains but this year they were lower. Inventory gain arises when a company buys raw material at a particular price but by the time it is able to process it, rates have gone up.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-20

The company has exported 59,408 units, the highest ever in a quarter, and 1,05,000 units in the first half of 2021-22. It had exported 32,100 units in the first half of 2020-21 when most of the global markets were closed. When asked how it managed to circumvent the component shortage for its export production, Shashank Srivastava, executive director, MSIL said: “The export models have different specs than our domestic models. And we did not have shortage of the semi-conductors needed for vehicles with those specs. The specs for Alto, Baleno, Swift for export are different from the domestic models.” Chairman RC Bhargava said: “We have doubled our exports and these are sustainable levels. We hope to do more. We have strengthened our position in the African markets with support from Toyota dealerships.” Of the 1,05,000 units exported in the first half, 53000 units were to the African continent. South Africa alone accounted for 31,000 units. Shortage looms Maruti expects an adverse impact on production at its two plants in Haryana and parent Suzuki’s Gujarat plant in November on account of semiconductor shortage. Terming the situation as quite dynamic, the car maker noted in a regulatory filing that according to current estimates the total vehicle production volume across both locations in Haryana next month could be around 85 per cent of normal roll-out. Capacity at Gurgaon and Manesar plants is around 15 lakh units per annum.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-20
