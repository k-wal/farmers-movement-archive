01-11-2020||Business||GST collection for October crosses Rs 1 lakh crore ||The goods and services tax (GST) collected in October rose to Rs 1.05 lakh crore, crossing the Rs 1 lakh crore mark for the first time since February this year, reflecting a pick-up in economic activity and demand. The finance ministry in a statement said on Sunday that the total number of GSTR-3B returns filed till October 31, 2020 is 80 lakh. The gross GST revenue collected in October 2020 is Rs 1,05,155 crore, of which CGST is Rs 19,193 crore, SGST is Rs 5,411 crore, IGST is Rs 52,540 crore (including Rs 23,375 crore collected on import of goods) and cess is Rs 8,011 crore (including Rs 932 crore collected on import of goods), the ministry said. The revenues for the month are 10 per cent higher than Rs 95,379 crore collected in the same month last year. The GST collections fell from the psychologically important Rs 1 lakh crore mark as the lockdown imposed to contain the COVID-19 spread dented economic activity. "The (tax collection) trend shows that it did decline for the past few months but it is not only on the path of recovery but is also picking up. In the month of September, GST collection was 4 per cent higher than what was there in the corresponding period last year. In the month of October, it has risen by 10 per cent year on year with a collection of above Rs 1.05 lakh crore," Finance Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey told PTI. GST revenue in February was Rs 1.05 lakh crore, March Rs 97,597 crore, April Rs 32,172 crore, May Rs 62,151 crore, June Rs 90,917 crore, July Rs 87,422 crore, August Rs 86,449 crore and September Rs 95,480 crore. GST revenue had topped Rs 1 lakh crore in 8 out of 12 months of 2019-20 fiscal. Deloitte Senior Director M S Mani said the numbers indicate the definitive revival of consumption and festival spends across the economy. "Continuance of this trend will help in narrowing the fiscal deficit for FY21 and will go a long way in reviving business confidence across sectors as the impact of the unlockdown process across states gets translated into GST collection figures," Mani said. PwC India Partner and Leader Pratik Jain said given the surge in number of returns filed and the fact that there is clear uptake in demand due to revival of economy as well as upcoming festive season, it's not surprising that collection in October has exceeded Rs 1 lakh crore. "Given the festivities, collections in November could also be robust. We would need to see if this trend continues after November as well," Jain added. EY Tax Partner Abhishek Jain said that some potential reasons for this surge could be the splurged demand on account of the festivities and input tax credit/other similar reconciliations which were due for businesses in September.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-248

01-11-2020||Business||ICICI numbers stun Street||ICICI Bank saw its net profit jump over six times for the September quarter because of a lower base in the year-ago period even as provisions rose. The private sector bank posted a standalone net profit of Rs 4,251.33 crore against Rs 654.96 crore in the same period of the previous year, a rise of 549 per cent. The record profit exceeded analysts’ estimates of a Rs 2,500-4,000 crore profit. The bank’s profits were hit in the corresponding period last year by a one-time tax adjustment. The profits in the second quarter of the current fiscal were also boosted by a one-time gain. During the second quarter of this fiscal, the bank sold equity shares representing 2 per cent in ICICI Securities for a total consideration of Rs 309.83 crore. The sale resulted in a net gain (after sale related expenses) of Rs 305.01 crore. Provisions, however, rose to Rs 2,995.27 crore against Rs 2,506.87 crore in the year-ago period. However, they were lower than Rs 7,593.95 crore in the preceding quarter. Sandeep Batra, president of ICICI Bank, said the provisions made by the lender since March is more than adequate to cover any potential contingencies and during this quarter, ICICI Bank did not have to use the Covid-19 related provisions that were made. He disclosed that collection efficiency is now almost at the pre-pandemic level. On the one-time restructuring, Batra said while there could be some requests, the bank was not expecting a large number with the economy now showing signs of recovery. He, however, cautioned that there could be some Covid related impact in the next two quarters though 2021-22 will be a “normalised year”. During the period, ICICI Bank’s asset quality improved with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) in absolute terms coming in at Rs 38,989.19 crore compared with Rs 40,386 crore in the first quarter of this fiscal and Rs 45,638.79 crore in the year-ago period. The gross NPAs came in at 5.17 per cent against 5.46 per cent on a sequential basis. Similarly, the net NPAs stood at 1 per cent against 1.23 per cent in the same period. ICICI Bank disclosed that the Supreme Court through its interim order on September 3 has directed that accounts which were not declared as NPAs till August 31 shall not be declared as NPA till further orders. “The bank has not classified such borrower accounts as NPAs as on September 30, 2020. If these borrower accounts were classified as NPAs by the bank, the pro forma gross NPA ratio and net NPA ratio (based on customer assets), would have been 5.36 per cent and 1.12 per cent, respectively, as on  September 30,” it disclosed. The lender pointed out that after the easing of restrictions, there has been a substantial month-on-month increase in disbursements across retail products. Mortgage disbursements during the second quarter crossed pre-Covid levels and reached an all-time monthly high in September. Further, auto loan disbursements also continued to increase from June and have reached pre-Covid levels in September reflecting the rise in passenger car sales. During the quarter, ICICI Bank saw its retail loan portfolio grow 13 per cent over the same period in the previous year and 6 per cent sequentially. Retail loans comprised 65.8 per cent of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2020. It added that disbursements across the rural portfolio have also crossed pre-Covid levels in the months of August and September even as credit card spends recovered to about 85 per cent of pre-Covid levels in September led by increased spends in categories such as health & wellness, electronics and e-commerce.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-249
01-11-2020||Business||Arby’s set to buy Dunkin’||In one of the largest restaurant deals in more than a decade, Dunkin’ will join some of America’s best-known restaurant chains, including Arby’s and Buffalo Wild Wings, under a single privately held owner. Dunkin’ Brands, the parent of Dunkin’ and Baskin-Robbins, agreed on Friday to sell itself for $11.3 billion, including debt, to Inspire Brands, the holding company that owns Sonic Drive-In and Jimmy John’s as well as Arby’s, Buffalo Wild Wings and others. Backed by the private equity firm Roark Capital, Inspire had already grown into one of the US’s largest restaurant operators since it formed less than three years ago. It employs more than 3,25,000 people, directly and via franchises, across more than 11,000 restaurants. Buying Dunkin’ will more than double Inspire’s footprint, adding 12,700 Dunkin’ and 7,900 Baskin-Robbins outlets, which are all franchised. Inspire is paying a steep price: a 20 per cent premium to Dunkin’s share price in the days before The New York Times first reported the talks. The shares were already trading near a record high, more than doubling since the pandemic hit in March. “Dunkin’ and Baskin-Robbins are category leaders with more than 70 years of rich heritage, and together they are two of the most iconic restaurant brands in the world,” Paul Brown, the chief executive of Inspire Brands, said in a statement on Friday. The deal is a bet that Dunkin’ will survive — and even thrive — as much of the industry has been ravaged, with about one in six restaurants having closed this year, some permanently. Fast-food outlets have held up better than full-service restaurants, as takeout and drive-through options have proved to be more appealing than long meals in a room full of strangers. Dunkin’ has drive-through windows in about 70 per cent of its restaurants and was already investing in digital-ordering tools to promote “high-frequency, low-touch” service. A $100-million plan to “accelerate its beverage-led strategy”, as the company described it in 2018, has also paid off as the pandemic has scrambled people’s routines. “This team’s grit and determination has enabled us to deliver outsized performance and made our brands among the most elite in the quick service industry,” Dunkin’s chief executive, Dave Hoffmann, said in a statement on Friday.
