The acquisition adds to Ambani’s current stake in EIH, which is one of the largest luxury hotel chains in India. For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, a Reliance arm — Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Ltd — held 18.83 per cent in EIH. Incidentally, this is the second major acquisition of an iconic British company by Ambani. He bought Hamleys in 2019 to strengthen its retail footprint. The UK-based firm, which owns a hotel and golf course in Buckinghamshire, UK, will add to Reliance’s consumer and hospitality assets, the firm said in a filing late on Thursday. “Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL), a wholly owned subsidiary of RIL, has on April 22, 2021, acquired the entire issued share capital of Stoke Park Ltd, a company incorporated in the UK, for £57 million,” it said. Stoke Park owns and manages sporting and leisure facilities in Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, UK. The facilities include a hotel, conference facilities, sports facilities and one of the highest rated golf courses in Europe. “RIIHL will look to enhance the sports and leisure facilities at this heritage site, while fully complying with the planning guidelines and local regulations,” Reliance added. This acquisition is expected to add to the consumer and hospitality footprint of the oil-to-telecom major. Reliance is also developing a state-of-the-art convention centre, hotel and managed residences at BKC in Mumbai. Stoke Park has always had a close relationship with Pinewood Studios and the British film industry. Two James Bond movies -— Goldfinger (1964) and Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) — were filmed at Stoke Park. The epic duel between James Bond (Sean Connery) and Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) is still considered to be the most famous game of golf in cinematic history, the Park stated on its website. Scenes such as mini-break and rowing scenes from Bridget Jones’s Diary (2001) starring Hugh Grant, Renée Zellweger and Colin Firth were also filmed at the estate with the Georgian-era mansion set in the midst of 300 acres of parkland. Stoke Park hosts 49 luxury bedrooms and suits, a 27-hole golf course, 13 tennis courts and 14 acres of private gardens. Though the Stoke Park estate has a recorded history of over 900 years, it was used as a private residence until 1908, according to its official website. Mayer Brown International LLP and Khaitan & Co acted as legal counsels for the transaction and Ernst & Young UK advised on financial and tax matters.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-71

The agency said it expects the second wave to start subsiding by mid-May. Earlier this month, the RBI maintained its 10.5 per cent GDP growth estimate, but governor Shaktikanta Das has flagged the rising cases as the biggest impediment to recovery. Other brokerages and analysts have also been revising down their forecasts in the light of the second wave. The economy is estimated to have contracted by 7.6 per cent in 2020-21. India Ratings said the impact of the second wave will not be as disruptive as the first one, despite the daily case load touching three times the first wave’s peak, as lockdowns are set to be localised ones. “Unlike the first wave, the administrative response is not abrupt, and is unfolding gradually in a graded manner. Also, households and businesses are better prepared and there is a significant amount of learning, which can help them navigate through the crisis,” the rating agency added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-71

The domestic unit ended at 75.01 against the US currency, registering a fall of 7 paise over its previous close. Foreign portfolio investors have been in a sell mode during this month as the surge in coronavirus cases has led to concerns over its impact on India’s fledgling economic recovery. However, US President Joe Biden’s plan to raise the top marginal income tax and the tax on capital gains — the proceeds of selling an asset like a stock — for people earning more than $1 million has thrown up some new questions for the Indian markets. The plan would effectively increase the rate Americans pay on that income to 39.6 per cent from 20 per cent. Wall Street’s main indexes had slid nearly 1 per cent on Thursday in response. Some experts feel the move could make FPIs return to the Indian markets where the valuations are already low. Others are of the view that the move could exacerbate outflows from India. However, some believe the outflows will be temporary given the fundamentals of the domestic economy and that it could recover strongly once the fresh Covid cases subside and the vaccination gathers pace. At the inter-bank forex market, the rupee opened lower at 75.02 against the previous close of 74.94 and traded in the range of 74.75 to 75.07 during the day. It finally ended at 75.01 against the US currency. Weakness in the equity markets also weighed in on the rupee. “We expect a broader USD-INR range to be 74.50-75.50,” said Rahul Gupta, head of research-currency, Emkay Global Financial Services. In the equity markets, after the relief rally on Thursday, shares were again under pressure as the pandemic’s  impact on corporate earnings took centre stage. The 30-share Sensex ended 202.22 points, or 0.42 per cent, lower after rising to a high of 48265.39. Barring eight shares which closed in the green, the rest ended with losses of up to 2.63 per cent. The Nifty ended 64.80 points lower at 14341.35. Provisional data showed that in Friday’s trade, the FPIs sold stocks worth Rs 1,361 crore which will take the total outflows to nearly Rs 8,700 crore in April. “Going ahead, Indian markets are likely to continue with its volatility. Once the pace of vaccination picks up and daily cases start subsiding, we expect the narrative to gradually shift from Covid-19 and restrictions back to fundamentals,” said Siddhartha Khemka, head-retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-71
24-04-2021||Business||RBI restricts American Express, Diners Club from on-boarding new customers from May 1||The Reserve Bank of India has barred American Express Banking Corp (American Express) and Diners Club International Ltd (Diners Club) from taking on new credit card customers after they failed to comply with the banking regulator's directive to store payments data only in the country. “The RBI has, by order dated April 23, imposed restrictions on American Express and Diners Club from on-boarding new domestic customers onto their card networks from May 1. These entities have been found non-compliant with the directions on Storage of Payment System Data. This order will not impact existing customers,” the central bank said in a statement today. American Express and Diners Club are payment system operators authorised to operate card networks in the country under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (PSS Act). The RBI said the supervisory action had been taken in exercise of powers vested under Section 17 of the PSS Act. According to RBI data, as of February this year, American Express had more than 15.59 lakh credit cards outstanding. Back in April 2018, the central bank had directed payment system providers to store all the data pertaining to payment systems only in India within a period of six months. They were required to report compliance to RBI and submit a board-approved system audit report (SAR). The directive was issued after the banking regulator observed that not all system providers were storing the payments data in India. The data storage directive is designed to ensure better monitoring of payment system operators. It will also provide unfettered supervisory access to data stored with these system providers, their service providers or intermediaries and other entities in the payments ecosystem. The payment system operators are required to store end-to-end transaction details in the country. If there is a foreign leg in the transaction, then only that portion of the data can be stored overseas. However, some of the overseas firms were worried that the RBI directives would raise costs and compliance requirements. Some of the overseas firms had reportedly suggested data mirroring options instead of a rigid storage requirement in India. The RBI, however, did not budge from its stand. In an FAQ issued in 2019, it said if the payment processing is done abroad, the data should be deleted from the systems there and brought back to India within 24 hours.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-71

Maharashtra alone accounts for 54 per cent,” Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at SBI, said in a research note. With Maharashtra in a lockdown till the month-end, its Rs 29.8 lakh crore economy will see an erosion of Rs 81,672 crore. In this backdrop, SBI has also lowered the real GDP growth forecast for FY22 to 10.4 per cent from 11 per cent earlier (RBI: 10.5 per cent); the nominal GDP forecast trimmed to 14.3 per cent from 15 per cent (budget: 14.4 per cent). Six of the top 15 worst affected districts in the country account for 25 per cent of GDP. “For these 13 states the cost of vaccines is 15-20 per cent of states’ health expenditure budget, still it will be only 0.1 per cent of GDP. This is much lower than the loss in GDP due to lockdown,” the report said. Economists expect the impact to be short-lived unless the mobility curbs are widened. Nomura expects the impact to be felt for the next three months. They have pegged GDP growth at 11.5 per cent in 2021, up from -6.9 per cent in 2020.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-71
24-04-2021||Business||RBI spikes bids of Rs 11,000 crore government securities maturing in 2026||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday did not accept any bids at an auction of Rs 11,000 crore government securities maturing in 2026. These were part of the Rs 32,000-crore that were on offer on Friday in a highly watched auction amid the market’s demand for higher yields. At the auction, for a notified amount of Rs 11,000 crore for the 5.63 per cent 2026 bond, though the central bank received bids for over Rs 38,747 crore, it did not accept any of the bids. However, for over Rs 4,800 crore in floating rate bonds due in 2033, the cut-off was fixed at 4.93 per cent. On the other hand, Rs 13,255 crore bonds (maturing in 2035) were sold at 6.72 per cent while a 2050 bond saw a cut-off yield of 6.8 per cent. The RBI managed to sell Rs 3,948 crore of these bonds. The cancellation of auction of bonds worth Rs 11,000 crore indicates that the markets have continued to demand higher yields amid factors such as a slowdown in the economy, high Covid-19 cases and elevated inflation. However, yields on the benchmark 10 year security settled at 6.03 per cent against the previous close of 6.05 per cent. While yields on the 10 year bond had inched up to 6.12 per cent despite the RBI announcing a government security acquisition programme, it has softened recently. Experts are of the view that it could trade in a range of 6-6.10 per cent. As part of its monetary policy earlier this month, the RBI had announced G-SAP 1.0 programme, under which it will commit upfront to a specific amount of open market purchases of government securities with a view to enabling a stable and orderly evolution of the yield curve amidst comfortable liquidity conditions. For the current quarter, it is looking to purchase Rs 1 lakh crore worth of bonds. On April 15, the central bank completed its first tranche of bond purchases under this programme of Rs 25,000 crore. However, the markets are looking for more support from the RBI.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-71

In December last year, in view of the pandemic, the central bank had said that lenders should continue to conserve capital to support the economy and absorb losses. It had then said that banks should not make any dividend payment on equity shares from the profits pertaining to the financial year ended March 31, 2020. Last week, HDFC Bank did not pay any dividend to its shareholders. The country’s largest private sector bank said this was due to the second wave of the pandemic. However,  the bank said its board will re-assess the position based on any further guidelines from the RBI in this regard. In a late evening circular issued on Thursday, the RBI allowed commercial banks to pay dividends for 2020-21, subject to certain conditions. The revised circular from the RBI provides that commercial banks can pay up to 50 per cent of what they could in pre-Covid years. For co-operative banks, all restrictions on dividends have been removed. However, the banking regulator clarified that all the lenders have been advised to be cautious, taking into account the adequacy of provisions and economic environment while considering dividend on equity shares.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-71

Industry sources said the consumption of petrol and diesel in April is likely to fall by as much as 20 per cent compared with the previous month due to the lockdown in Delhi, Maharashtra and other states. They said state-owned refiners may need to start cutting production by at least 10 per cent if the lockdowns in Delhi and Mumbai continue in May. The two cities are the biggest transport fuel markets. Petrol sales returned to pre-Covid levels in September and the festival season helped pull diesel demand up in the following months. In March, fuel demand soared 18 per cent to 18.77 million tonnes with diesel consumption rising 27 per cent and petrol climbing 25.7 per cent. This was because of the low base effect of March 2020 when restrictions came into effect. Energy research firm FGE has estimated that daily petrol demand is declining by 100,000 barrels this month and 170,000 barrels a day in May, while diesel consumption is expected to decrease by 220,000 barrels and 400,000 barrels a day over the same period. Before the virus flare-up, motor fuel and diesel sales in March were at about 750,000 barrels and 1.75 million barrels a day, respectively. Officials said IOC refineries are operating at about 95 per cent of their capacity, down from 100 per cent at the same time last month. Though the reductions in production were marginal, industry officials said there could be deeper reductions in the coming days.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-72

The Noida-based firm also announced a special interim dividend of Rs 10 per share to mark its $10 billion annual revenue milestone. The IT major had registered a net profit of Rs 3,154 crore in the January-March 2020 quarter, HCL said in a regulatory filing. Including the impact of the one-time milestone bonus, HCLT’s net profit for the March 2021 quarter was at Rs 2,387 crore. The decline in net profit was on account of higher tax outgo during the quarter under review. Its revenue grew 5.7 per cent to Rs 19,642 crore from Rs 18,590 crore in the corresponding quarter last year, according to US GAAP. For the 2020-21 fiscal, HCLT’s consolidated net profit increased 17.6 per cent to Rs 13,011 crore, while the revenue grew 6.7 per cent to Rs 75,379 crore from the previous financial year.
