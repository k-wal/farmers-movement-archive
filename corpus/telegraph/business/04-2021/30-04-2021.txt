The 30-share BSE index sank 983.58 points or 1.98 per cent to finish at 48,782.36. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty tanked 263.80 points or 1.77 per cent to 14,631.10. HDFC twins were the top losers in the Sensex pack, shedding over 4 per cent, followed by ICICI Bank, Kotak Bank, Asian Paints, M&M, HUL, TCS and Maruti. On the other hand, ONGC, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's and Bajaj Auto were the gainers. According to Binod Modi, Head-Strategy at Reliance Securities, domestic equities fell sharply on weak global cues and heavy sell-off in financial stocks. Asian markets traded weak on emerging concerns about growth after China's factory activity expanded slower than expected in April. Barring pharma, metals and IT, most of key sectoral indices saw selling pressure. "Persistent rise in daily caseload and higher number of deaths continue to remain matter of concerns for central and state governments and therefore any possibility of further economic restrictions cannot be ruled out by the state governments. Market is expected to be volatile until we see a clear reversal in COVID-19 cases," he said. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo ended on a negative note. Bourses in Europe were trading with marginal gains in mid-session deals. Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 1.31 per cent lower at USD 67.15 per barrel.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-65
30-04-2021||Business||Sensex tanks 400 points in early trade||Market benchmark Sensex plunged over 400 points in early trade on Friday, tracking losses in index-heavyweights HDFC twins, ICICI Bank and Kotak Bank amid a negative trend in Asian equities. The 30-share BSE index tumbled 424.70 points or 0.85 per cent to 49,341.24 in initial deals. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty declined 117.65 points or 0.79 per cent to 14,777.25. HDFC Bank was the top loser in the Sensex pack, shedding around 3 per cent, followed by HDFC, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Titan, Kotak Bank and SBI. On the other hand, ONGC, Dr Reddy's, Bajaj Auto, Sun Pharma and Infosys were the gainers. In the previous session, Sensex finished 32.10 points or 0.06 per cent higher at 49,765.94, and Nifty advanced 30.35 points or 0.20 per cent to 14,894.90. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net buyers in the capital market as they purchased shares worth Rs 809.37 crore on Thursday, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) sold shares worth Rs 942.35 crore, according to provisional exchange data. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said, spiking COVID tells us that the light at the end of the tunnel, which the market is focussed on, is a long way away. But the market is taking cues from the second wave experience of other countries where the curve flattened and fell in around two months. "This explains the resilience of the market in the midst of very negative COVID-related news. An important point to be understood is that global markets are highly correlated, and therefore, a major correction is likely to be global," he stated. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo were trading on a negative note in mid-session deals. Bourses on Wall Street ended with gains in overnight sessions. Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 0.44 per cent higher at USD 67.75 per barrel.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-65
30-04-2021||Business||Hindustan Unilever reports 41 per cent growth in net profits for March quarter||Hindustan Unilever (HUL) on Thursday topped analyst estimates as it reported a 41 per cent growth in net profits for the March quarter of 2021. The FMCG giant posted a standalone net profit of Rs 2,143 crore against Rs 1,519 crore a year ago. Analysts were expecting the company to report a net profit of Rs 2,000 crore. The strong numbers came as HUL saw a robust demand for its products over the same time last year when the pandemic had led to a nationwide lockdown. During the quarter, HUL saw a volume growth of 16 per cent, which was above the 14 per cent as forecast by some analysts. “Our in-quarter performance was strong on both the topline and bottomline. Despite challenging times, in 2020-21 our business ecosystem has withstood the disruption and demonstrated agility and resilience across the value chain,” said Sanjiv Mehta, chairman and managing director of HUL. He added that the recent surge in Covid cases is of serious concern. During the quarter, sales grew around 35 per cent to Rs 11,947 crore against Rs 8,885 crore in the year-ago period. HUL said during the period, health, hygiene and nutrition, which form close to 80 per cent of its business, grew in double-digits for the third consecutive quarter, even as discretionary and out-of-home categories showed a sequential improvement. Commenting on the performance of its various divisions, HUL said home care showed a growth of 15 per cent and this was enabled by a strong recovery in fabric wash. The company added that household care continued its strong performance, delivering a double-digit growth. The board of directors of HUL have proposed a final dividend of Rs 17 per share. Coupled with an interim dividend of Rs 14 per share, the total payout for 2020-21 stands at Rs 31 per share. During the year, a special dividend of Rs 9.5 per share was also paid. Shares of HUL today ended at Rs 2409.05 in the BSE, as against its last close of Rs 2407.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-65

Stocks of Tata Steel and JSW Steel were up 6.55 per cent and 9.59 per cent, respectively, on the NSE even as broader indices Nifty 50 inched up marginally by 0.2 per cent during a choppy trading session. The TSL and JSW scrips closed at Rs 1,035 and Rs 726.20 — levels never seen by investors before. While the stocks were touching  fresh highs in recent weeks, Thursday’s breakout rally appeared to have been triggered by China, the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel. On April 28, China announced a decision to withdraw export rebates on major finished steel products and cut import duty on various semi-finished, crude and scrap steel. The changes will come into effect from May 1. The rebate will now only apply to 28 per cent of China’s steel export compared with 98 per cent previously. Steel stocks surged after the development and the brokerages suggested that leading players such as Tata and JSW would benefit from the move. JP Morgan also noted that SAIL would benefit because of the integrated nature (captive iron ore mine) of the business. JP Morgan and Kotak Institutional Securities said there is potential for hot rolled coil prices to increase by Rs 6,000-7,000 a tonne during May-June. However, Credit Suisse argued that much of the uptick from Chinese tax rejig, anticipated over the last two months, are already priced in. According to India Ratings, a Fitch company, HRC prices stood at Rs 63,400 (ex-Mumbai), up by 17 per cent month-on-month and 66 per cent year-on-year. The agency noted that HRC (flat steel) spreads stood at Rs 47,000 a tonne, while rebar (long steel) spread stood at 36,000 a tonne. However, the risk to the momentum could well be the second wave of Covid which may slow down domestic consumption. But if the export market continues to be strong, large integrated players may not face strong headwinds. Moreover, shortage of industrial oxygen in the wake of the pandemic is curtailing production of secondary producers. This may help larger players to gain more market share in the short to medium term.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-65
30-04-2021||Business||Mutual fund industry largely welcomes Sebi pay plan||The mutual fund industry has largely welcomed market regulator Sebi’s plan to ensure that top executives have more skin in their game through a compensation plan that requires them to receive 20 per cent of their monthly salary in the form of units. Top CEOs of the industry found nothing wrong with the regulator’s move, but are worried about the implementation and implication for junior employees as 20 per cent of their salary will be locked in for three years. In a late evening circular on Wednesday, Sebi said at least 20 per cent of key employees’ salaries should be paid in the form of units of mutual fund schemes in which they have an oversight. The compensation paid in the form of units needs to be proportionate to the asset under management (AUM) of the schemes. More importantly, such mutual fund units will be locked-in for a minimum period of three years or the tenure of the scheme, whichever is less. Radhika Gupta, MD & CEO, Edelweiss AMC, tweeted that Sebi’s directions will be difficult to implement. Questioning how such decisions can be made at the beginning of the year, Gupta said that though the circular is a good idea in spirit, it will be extremely problematic in implementation. “This circular applies to not just senior employees but junior research staff, dealers and support function heads. These people don’t earn the kind of money CEOs and chief investment officers (CIOs) do. It mandates how much one saves,” she said, adding that for an employee earning a relatively less salary, it will be difficult to put away 20 per cent. “We are constraining employee cash flows… If we want to build skin in the game, a simple rule would do it: for people earning more than Rs 50 lakh, 50 (or some per cent) of your investments (not assets) should be in your own funds. Finished,” she added. There are also apprehensions over franctionalisation. While the CEOs have oversight over all the schemes and, therefore, their unit-based compensation will be spread over a wider pool, this may not be the case with other key employees who handle only some schemes. Sebi has also said that the directions will be implemented from July while fund houses generally announce salary packages at the beginning of the fiscal. This could pose another niggle for the mutual funds.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-65
30-04-2021||Business||Rahul Bajaj steps down as chairman and non-executive director of Bajaj Auto||Rahul Bajaj on Thursday stepped down as the chairman and non-executive director of Bajaj Auto. He will be replaced by Niraj Bajaj. Rahul Bajaj has been at the helm of the two-wheeler major since 1972 and the group for five decades. In a regulatory filing to the bourses, Bajaj Auto said that Rahul Bajaj has tendered his resignation considering his age. At its meeting held on Thursday, the board of directors, as recommended by the nomination and remuneration committee, has approved his appointment as chairman emeritus for a term of five years from May 2021. Last year, Rahul Bajaj had decided to give up his executive role to become a non-executive director while holding the position of the chairman. In July 2020, he had stepped down as the non-executive chairman of Bajaj Finance. After Rahul Bajaj resigned as the chairman of Bajaj Finance after leading it for 33 years, son Sanjiv Bajaj had donned the mantle as non-executive chairman. Earlier this week, Rahul Bajaj had also resigned as the non-executive director at Bajaj Finance, effective April 30. Here too, the board has proposed his appointment as chairman emeritus of the NBFC for a term of five year beginning May 1, 2021. Eighty three-year-old Rahul Bajaj took over the group’s reins in 1965 and has since then charted it into a strong growth path. Under his leadership, the turnover of Bajaj Auto has leapt from around Rs 7 crore to over Rs 27,000 crore. Known for his outspoken and frank views, Bajaj holds an honours degree in economics from Delhi University, a degree in law from Bombay University and an MBA from the Harvard Business School. He was elected to the Rajya Sabha from 2006-2010. He has handed over the baton at Bajaj Auto to elder son Rajiv Bajaj. The 67 year old Niraj Bajaj, who will take over as the non-executive director at Bajaj Auto, had joined the company’s board in September 2006. He is also the chairman and managing director of Mukand Ltd. After studying at the Sydenham College of Commerce & Economics, Mumbai, he acquired his masters in business administration from Harvard Business School. Niraj Bajaj has represented India in table tennis for seven years between 1970 and 1977, the last four years as the team captain. He was the recipient of the Arjuna Award. Net profit up 1.66% Bajaj Auto’s standalone March-quarter net profit rose 1.66 per cent to Rs 1,332.07 crore from Rs 1,310.29 crore, marginally below analyst estimates. During the quarter, standalone revenues rose to Rs 8,596.10 crore from Rs 6,815.85 crore a year ago. Two-wheelers showed a growth of 21 per cent in volume terms at 487,731 units. Sales of commercial vehicles (CVs), however, fell 38 per cent to 46,388 units. The domestic CV business was impacted because of the reduced demand for short distance mobility. Exports put up a better show with two-wheelers logging a growth of 24 per cent in volume terms and commercial vehicles 19 per cent. The board of directors of the company on Thursday recommend a dividend of Rs 140 per share and the total payout towards dividend would amount to around Rs 4,051 crore. The company added that its overall share in motorcycles in the domestic and international market among players from India was 27.6 per cent as against 27.5 per cent in 2019-20. .||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-65

Against a demand of 102 tonnes of gold in the first quarter of 2020, demand has surged to 140 tonnes in the first quarter of 2021 despite prices rising by 14 per cent. While jewellery demand at 102.5 tonnes during the quarter was up 39 per cent, investment demand at 37.5 tonnes was up 34 per cent compared to the first quarter of 2020. The World Gold Council on Thursday said that the expectation about prices have changed with the current price of around Rs 47,000 more acceptable among buyers. The average domestic gold price of Rs 47,131 per 10 gram is 14 per cent higher compared to the corresponding quarter a year ago and more significantly 16 per cent lower than the Rs 56,000 per 10 gram in August 2020. “This (140 tonnes) on its own is not one of the best historical figures. We have normally seen around 190 tonnes kind of demand. But it is still a significant jump of 37 per cent over last year. This is despite the fact that the price as compared to last year is 14 per cent higher.” “Last year the buying was low as people thought that a price of around Rs 41,000 is a significant increase and people were not willing to look at anything above Rs 38,00039,000 as a sustainable price. As a result they were actually waiting to see how the prices would react. This quarter we saw a price of around Rs 47,000 range. Yet buying was up 37 per cent. This signifies that the consumers are getting used to prices,” said Somasundaram PR, managing director, India, World Gold Council. He added that a reduction in customs duty on gold, together with an appreciating rupee throughout much of the quarter has presented a significant buying opportunity for retail investors. The industry body, however has placed a cautious outlook for the second quarter. “As lockdowns are reimposed in various regions of the country in response to rising Covid19 cases, consumer confidence has dipped. This is likely to impact wedding demand during the Q2 of 2021. Digital and omni channel retail strategies developed over the last year by many players may cushion the drop unlike Q2 2020 but the current crisis is beyond just economics and logistics. Therefore sentiment may be affected till large-scale vaccination is achieved,” World Gold Council said. Global demand for the yellow metal at 815.7 tonnes was a 23 per cent drop on a year on year basis as gold backed exchange traded funds saw an outflow of 177.9 tonnes. Analysts anticipate volatility in gold prices to remain. “Market participants will keep an eye on the US Q1 GDP data and weekly jobless claims scheduled later in the day which could trigger further volatility in the market. Broader range on Comex could be between USD 17751798 and on domestic front prices could hover in the range of Rs 47,00047,550,” said Navneet Damani, vice president – commodities research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-66

30-04-2021||Business||World Bank commodity price outlook report indicates 2021 will be a bull run for all commodities||The World Bank commodity price outlook report has indicated that 2021 will be a bull run for all commodities in general, after which there will be tapering down in 2022. Gold will be an exception, which will slow down in 2021. The interesting facet here is that the prices for most categories will not just be higher than 2020, when there was a tendency for them to decline, but also over 2019 which was the pre-pandemic year. “However the risk can be any slowdown in the world economy due to the pandemic as that will upset most calculations,” said Care Rating in its research report on the World Bank study. While the energy prices are expected to average more than one-third higher in 2021 followed by a smaller increase in 2022, the non-energy prices are forecast to increase 19 per cent in 2021 but a modest decline is expected in 2022 as metal price increases partially unwind. Oil prices are forecast to average $56/ bbl in 2021 and rise to $60/bbl in 2022, broadly in line with their 201719 average. Demand is expected to be firm over 2021 as the economic recovery gains momentum and vaccinations become more widely available, particularly in advanced economies. Natural gas prices are forecast to average around one-third higher in 2021 compared to 2020, with steeper increases in European prices and a small decline in Japanese contract prices. Price differentials between the three benchmarks are expected to continue to shrink as a result of the growing availability of LNG. Coal prices are expected to rise by around 30 per cent. Metal prices are projected to average 30 per cent higher in 2021 than last year before easing in 2022. Upside risks to this outlook include further stimulus programs and an intensified drive toward decarbonisation. Downside risks include a resurgence of COVID19 infections and a sooner-than-expected withdrawal of stimulus measures in China. Aluminium prices are projected to increase by about 29 per cent in 2021, before falling 7 per cent in 2022. Copper prices are projected to average 38 per cent higher in 2021 compared to last year. However, they are expected to drop 12 per cent in 2022 as new supplies materialize. Iron ore prices are projected to increase by 24 per cent in 2021 before dropping considerably in 2022 as Chinese demand stabilizes and new supply comes on stream. Silver and platinum prices are anticipated to continue to outperform gold in 2021, given the metals’ wider use in industry. Precious metals prices are forecast to fall in 2022 as investment demand recedes. However, higher inflationary expectations could push prices higher, while an unexpected resurgence in the US dollar and intensified selling of safe haven assets could put downward pressure. Gold prices fell by 4 per cent in 2021 Q1, driven by a drop in financial investment demand due to rising US real yields. Gold prices are expected to average 4 per cent lower in 2021, and ease further in 2022. Silver prices, in contrast, rose by 8 per cent in 2021Q1 to their highest level in eight years, and were 60 per cent higher than a year earlier. Silver prices are expected to rise by about 22 per cent in 2021 but decline in 2022 as silver faces similar headwinds to gold (rising yields) and substitution in industrial applications The Grain Price Index is expected to average 14 per cent higher in 2021, followed by a small gain in 2022. Tea prices declined 9 per cent in 2021 Q1 but they are almost 10 per cent higher than a year ago. Tea prices surged during the pandemic as lockdowns disrupted tea plucking in some regions, especially in India. As restrictions on labour movement eased, tea production increased, in turn pushing tea price down. Prices have been also affected by better than expected supplies from East Africa due to exceptional weather conditions. As supply recovers further, tea prices are expected to decline 7 per cent in 2021 before making a small gain in 2022, it added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-66

Food and grocery retail market constitutes the largest chunk of domestic retail trade. In March, Tata Sons had sought approval from the CII for its $1billion deal to acquire the online grocer. Under the deal, Tata Digital Limited — the group’s digital services subsidiary — will acquire a 64.3 per cent stake in Supermarket Grocery Supplies Pvt Ltd (SGS), which sells products to commercial units through business bigbasket.com. In the next stage, SGS will take full control of Innovative Retail Concepts Pvt Ltd, which sells products to consumers through bigbasket.com. Chinese retail giant Alibaba, which has a 29 per cent stake in BigBasket, will be offloading its entire stake to the Tatas through this deal. BigBasket has the largest market share among online grocers and with the Tata backing could be a bigger competitor for Amazon and Reliance Retail. A whollyowned subsidiary of Tata Sons Pvt Ltd, TDL provides technology services related to identity and access management, loyalty programmes, offers and payments.An official release said Competition Commission of India (CCI) has approved the proposed deal of Tata group acquiring up to 64.3 per cent stake in Bigbasket.The deal involves TDL buying 64.3 per cent of the total share capital of SGS (on a fully diluted basis) through a combination of primary and secondary acquisitions, in one or more series of steps. This is the first transaction."It is stated that subsequently, through a separate transaction, SGS may acquire sole control over Innovative Retail Concepts Pvt Ltd (IRC) (transaction 2). Transaction 1 and Transaction 2 are collectively referred to as the proposed combination."The proposed combination will result in the acquisition by TDL of majority stake of and control over SGS," the release said. Founded in 2011, BigBasket operates in 25 Indian cities. It competes with SoftBankbacked Grofers as well as Amazon India and Flipkart. Deals beyond a certain threshold require approval from CCI. The share of food and grocery retail in India rests at 65.9 per cent, a significant and the largest chunk of the overall retail market in the country, of market size of $560 billion, according to a 2020 report by Technopak Advisors. Of this, the reach and size of online food and grocery ecommerce rests at 0.5 per cent and $2.75 billion, respectively, as of FY20. A large part of the retail trade is still unorganised and dominated by small mompop stores or neighbourhood shops. Over the next five years, however, the online food and grocery retail market is set to touch $28 billion with a 4 per cent penetration. This number will be nearly on a par with the size of modern trade or sales though large, organised food, and grocery retailers in the same period.In contrast, in FY20, 14 per cent of all apparel retail happened online, for consumer electronics the share was even greater at 26 per cent.“Since 2012 the growth of Indian Retail has also outpaced the overall growth of India’s GDP. This was primarily driven by increase of discretionary retail and that in turn was attributed to rising income and affordability of the consuming class . This is reflected in the falling share of food and grocery retail and the rising share of discretionary retail categories between FY 12 and FY 20," Technopak said in its estimates. Tata Motors global design head Tata Motors on Thursday announced the appointment of Martin Uhlarik as the company’s new global design head.
