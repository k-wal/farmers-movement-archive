The 30-share BSE index ended 85.40 points or 0.16 per cent lower at 51,849.48, while the broader NSE Nifty inched up 1.35 points or 0.01 per cent to 15,576.20. ITC was the top loser in the Sensex pack, shedding nearly 3 per cent, followed by Tech Mahindra, Axis Bank, Asian Paints, TCS, HCL Tech, HDFC and Kotak Bank. On the other hand, IndusInd Bank, PowerGrid, Reliance Industries, Bajaj Auto and Maruti were among the gainers. "Ahead of the MPC policy, domestic market continued its volatility with a mixed bias. Selling was witnessed in financials, IT and FMCG stocks but it reduced towards the close of trading," said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. Weakness across US and Asian markets also added to the negative trend, he noted. "PSU banks attracted buyers in hopes that the government will soon finalise the list for privatisation. In the policy, RBI is expected to focus on economic growth by maintaining the status quo on policy rates and ensuring liquidity while keeping an eye on the inflationary pressure due to rising commodity prices," Nair said. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai and Hong Kong ended in the negative territory, while Tokyo and Seoul rose. Equities in Europe were trading with gains in mid-session deals.

The steady decline in fresh COVID cases and rising recovery rates indicate that India is succeeding in bending the pandemic's curve, said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.  "With no short-term risks to the market, consolidation is likely in the near term with a stock-specific action in response to the news. Since markets are over-bought and over-valued investors should exercise caution even when the markets are exhibiting surprising resilience," he added.  Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading in the negative territory in mid-session deals, while Tokyo was trading in the positive territory.  Equities on Wall Street closed with losses in the overnight session.

02-06-2021||Business||IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index stands at 50.8 in May||The surprise 6.9 per cent growth in the manufacturing sector in the fourth quarter (January-March) of 2021-22 may be a statistical aberration or just a flash in the pan. Sobering micro data has just kicked in that will dampen the enthusiasm of anyone who harboured the hopes of a quick recovery. The IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index stood at 50.8 in May 2021 — a 10 month low — compared with 55.5 in April, according to a media statement on Tuesday. A reading above 50 indicates economic expansion. “The Indian manufacturing sector is showing increasing signs of strain as the Covid-19 crisis intensifies. Key gauges of current sales, production and input buying weakened noticeably in May and pointed to the slowest rates of increase in 10 months. In fact, all indices were down from April,” said Pollyanna de Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. Darren Aw, Asia Economist, Capital Economics, said the drop in manufacturing PMI suggested that activity had taken a hit from the second virus wave despite the sector being largely exempt from containment measures. “And though the outbreak is now subsiding, the recovery is likely to be more gradual than it was after the lifting of restrictions last year. The reading has fallen to its lowest level since July. This suggests that broader weakness in domestic demand has taken a toll on the manufacturing sector.” Lima, however, noted that the detrimental impacts of the pandemic and associated restrictions seen in the manufacturing sector were considerably less severe than during the first lockdown when unprecedented contractions had been recorded. The growth of the manufacturing sector was curbed by the escalation of the pandemic and difficulties in securing raw materials, the survey said. “Amid a lack of new work, goods producers reduced headcounts again, with the rate of job shedding quickening in May,” Lima said. On the macroeconomic front, India’s economy contracted less-than-expected 7.3 per cent in the fiscal year ended March 2021 after reporting a positive growth of 1.6 per cent  in the fourth quarter. The next bi-monthly monetary policy review of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is scheduled to be announced on June 4. Experts believe, with the economic outlook remaining uncertain in light of the continuing pandemic, the monetary policy stance of RBI is likely to remain accommodative. Overseas trends China's factory activity growth slowed slightly in May as raw materials costs grew at their fastest pace in over a decade, weighing on the output of small and export-oriented firms. The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched lower to 51 in May, against analyst expectations that it would remain unchanged from April at 51.1. The PMI in the Eurozone rose to 63.1 in May from April's 62.9, the highest reading since the survey began in June 1997.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-32
02-06-2021||Business||SBI slashes 2021-22 GDP growth forecast to 7.9 per cent in Ecowrap report||SBI has come out with its Ecowrap report in which it has slashed its 2021-22 GDP growth forecast to 7.9 per cent from 10.4 per cent earlier. However, it imparted an "upward bias” to the number based on what it termed a “fervent hope” that the country could achieve 1 crore vaccinations per day from mid-July in line with the government's projections. At present, the country is vaccinating 28 lakh per day. The report draws attention to a peculiar characteristic in the provisional estimates: in absolute terms, nominal GDP contracted Rs 6.1 lakh crore while real GDP shrank Rs 10.6 lakh crore in the year ended March 31. “In FY21, the contraction in real GDP is more than the contraction in nominal GDP, which is quite disturbing,,” says the report. The study has also examined a district-wise comparison of the Covid deaths for each state between the first and second wave. It concludes that deaths in the second wave have had a profound impact in rural and semi-rural areas. "These (deaths) account for lower amount of overall economic activity; thus the GDP loss due to the current wave is lower than that in the first wave where urban and semi-urban centres were affected more. However, rural is not as resilient as urban and, hence. the pick-up in pent up demand is unlikely to make a large difference in 2021-22 GDP estimates," the report says. They, however, said that at Rs 145.8 lakh crore, the real GDP for 2021-22 will be “slightly higher” than those in 2019-20, and called it a “W-shaped” recovery with two troughs and not the earlier anticipated 'V-shaped' recovery. Moody’s view The Indian economy would rebound in the current fiscal and clock a growth of 9.3 per cent, but a severe second Covid wave has increased risks to India's credit profile and rated entities, Moody's Investors Service said on Tuesday. Moody's in February had forecast 13.7 per cent growth, this fiscal.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-32
02-06-2021||Business||Opec+ to stick to existing pace of gradually easing supply curbs||Opec+ oil producers agreed on Tuesday to stick to the existing pace of gradually easing supply curbs through July as they sought to balance expectations of a recovery in demand against a possible increase in Iranian supply. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies — known collectively as Opec+ — decided in April to return 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd) of supply to the market during May through July as it anticipated demand would rise despite high numbers of coronavirus cases in India. Since that decision, oil prices have extended their rally and have now gained more than 30 per cent this year, although the prospect of more crude from Iran, as talks on reviving its nuclear deal make progress, has limited the upside. Benchmark Brent crude hit $71 a barrel, its highest since March, on Tuesday. Speaking after an Opec+  conference — being held online  most months after the pandemic prevented the usual face-to-face meetings in Vienna — Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said he saw a good recovery in demand in the US and China. “The vaccine rollout has gathered pace with around 1.8 billion vaccines administered around the world ... This can only lead to further rebalancing of the global oil market,” he said. Opec secretary-general Mohammad Barkindo said he did not expect higher Iranian oil supply to cause problems if and when Tehran reaches a nuclear deal with Western powers in return for an easing of oil sanctions. “We anticipate that the expected return of Iranian production and exports to the global market will occur in an orderly and transparent fashion,” he said in a statement. Iran could boost production and exports by between 1.0 and 1.5 million bpd if sanctions are fully removed. Opec+ still forecasts a 6 million bpd jump in oil demand in 2021 — equivalent to 6 per cent of global consumption — as the world recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic. Opec+ cut output by a record 9.7 million bpd last year as demand collapsed when the pandemic first struck. As of July, the curbs still in place will stand at 5.8 million bpd. On Tuesday, Opec+  did not discuss output levels beyond August, three sources said. OPEC+ would next meet on July 1.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-32

Infosys on Tuesday said it would initiate a probe into the matter. In an interim order passed by wholetime member Madhabi Puri Buch, the market regulator said illegal gains worth Rs 3.06 crore be impounded from two of the entities — Capital One Partners and Tesora Capital. The entities have allegedly traded in the scrip of Infosys while in possession of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) pertaining to the firm’s financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. Capital One and its working partners — Amit Bhutra and Bharath C Jain — have been barred from the securities market. Sebi has also barred Tesora Capital and its partners — Amit Bhutra, Ankush Bhutra and Manish Champalal Jain— from the markets. Besides, Pranshu Bhutra, senior corporate counsel of Infosys, and Venkata Subramaniam V.V, senior principal, corporate accounting group of Infosys, have been barred. According to the order, Amit Bhutra was connected with Pranshu Bhutra through frequent phone calls. It has been noted that Subramaniam and Pranshu continue to be employed with Infosys and had access to ongoing UPSIs. By virtue of being a designated person, Subramaniam was reasonably expected to have access to and be in possession of UPSIs.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-32

Attorney General K.K. Venugopal on Tuesday told the apex court the GST council would be meeting on June 8 to take a formal decision on granting various reliefs to individuals importing medical equipment. The senior most law officer argued that pending the GST Council decision, the court must stay the Delhi high court order of May 21. The Delhi court while quashing the levy of the GST on oxygen concentrators said the levy violated the fundamental right to life and personal liberty. The high court had passed the impugned order while dealing with a writ petition filed by one Gurucharan Singh questioning the GST on the import of life saving equipment particularly when the country was grappling with the acute shortage of oxygen concentrators. Appearing on behalf of the finance ministry, Venugopal told the bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah that the government had  prior to the high court verdict brought down the GST on concentrators to 12 per cent. He said earlier the levy was 77 per cent but reduced to 28 per cent and gradually brought down to 12 per cent. Justice Chandrachud heading the bench reminded the AG that the court during the earlier hearing on Covid related issues had asked the Centre’s views on exempting wheel chairs from tax. Venugopal said the GST Council was sitting on June 8  and they would consider all these issues. The high court judgment ought to be stayed in the meantime. Justice M.R Shah, reminded the AG that the high court had passed the order while taking into consideration the constitutional rights of citizens for equality and right to life. Perhaps the Centre had not properly argued its case in the high court, he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-33

The PSU sold 44mt to the power plants last month, up 41 per cent over the year-ago period. Coal stock at the thermal power plants fell 5mt in April from 28.9mt in March because of the onset of summer and a higher demand for the  fuel. The stock was restored to 29mt in May. Data from the Central Electricity Authority show thermal power generation for the ongoing fiscal till May 20, 2021 at 162 trillion units, which were 3.54 per cent above the programmed generation for the period. Generation was significantly affected in 2020-21, with actual output at 90.69 per cent of the programmed generation for the fiscal. The impact was more prominent in the first half as a country-wide lockdown put a pause on economic activity. “Due to the Covid induced lockdown, coal supplies had suffered last year. But even then, a robust 30mt offtake upsurge during the first two months of the current fiscal year is an encouraging sign compared with April-May 2020. During this period, coal offtake to the power sector was higher by 23.6mt,” said a Coal India executive. Total coal offtake for April-May was 109.1mt compared with 79mt in the same period a year ago. Supply to the power sector was 86.3mt compared with 62.7mt in the same period a year ago. Coal India liquidated a total of 25mt of stocks in the first two months after the stock rose to 100mt at the start of the fiscal. Coal India produced 84mt in the first two months of the fiscal year but the growth was a modest 2.6 per cent over previous year. Officials however said that keeping the stock level in mind, production can be ramped up even at a short notice when demand peaks to higher levels in the coming months.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-33
