13-09-2020||Business||Singapore Convention in force||The Singapore Convention on Mediation came into force on Saturday and will provide a more effective way to enforce mediated settlements of corporate disputes involving businesses in India and other countries that are signatories to the Convention. Also known as the United Nations Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation, this is also the first UN treaty to be named after Singapore. “With the Convention in force, businesses seeking enforcement of a mediated settlement agreement across borders can do so by applying directly to the courts of countries that have signed and ratified the treaty, instead of having to enforce the settlement agreement as a contract in accordance with each country’s domestic process,” an official statement said on Saturday. The harmonised and simplified enforcement framework under the Convention translates to savings in time and legal costs, which is especially important for businesses in times of uncertainty, such as during the current Covid-19 pandemic, the statement issued by Singapore's Ministry of Law said. As on September 1, the Convention has 53 signatories, including India, China and the US. According to the statement, the Convention, which entered into force on Saturday, would boost India’s ‘ease of doing business’ credentials by enabling swift mediated settlements of corporate disputes. “Businesses in India and around the world will now have greater certainty in resolving cross-border disputes through mediation, as the Convention provides a more effective means for mediated outcomes to be enforced,” it said. Singapore had worked with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) and other UN member states and non-governmental organisations to contribute to the development of the Convention. Singapore’s minister for home affairs and law K. Shanmugam said the Convention’s entry into force is a significant milestone as it further strengthens the international dispute resolution enforcement framework. “This benefits businesses by providing greater certainty in resolving cross-border commercial disputes, ultimately facilitating international trade and commerce,” he added. Secretary of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Joubin-Bret said that with the Convention successfully entering into force, “we look forward to it bringing certainty and stability to the international framework on mediation, and contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals.” Over the years, Singapore has set up various institutions to provide a full suite of dispute resolution services for international commercial parties to resolve their disputes in Singapore. These include the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, Singapore International Mediation Centre and Singapore International Commercial Court, the statement said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-291

In May, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a Rs 90,000-crore liquidity infusion into cash-strapped discoms for payment of their dues till March 2020. Discoms have been facing a demand slump because of the lockdown to contain Covid-19. Participating in a webinar on “Innovation in Renewable Energy” organised by PHDCCI, power secretary S.N. Sahai said the liquidity package would cover the dues of discoms for the months from April to June also and it would be enhanced to Rs 1.2 lakh crore. While announcing the package, the government had said, “At present, discoms have a total outstanding of Rs 94,000 crore towards power generation firms (gencos).” However, later states demanded that the package be extended to include the dues towards power generation and transmission firms for the months of April and May as well. A source said that an official communication has already been sent to the implementing state-owned non-banking finance firms Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and REC by the power ministry. The source further said the respective boards of REC and PFC will approve the hike in the liquidity package to around Rs 1.2 lakh crore covering dues till June this year by the end of September.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/page-291
