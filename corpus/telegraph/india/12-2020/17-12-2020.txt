In an apparent attack on the left parties, the minister said they were still speaking the language they used in 1962 when India went to war with China. The minister, in an eight-page open letter to farmers, said the Modi-government was committed to their welfare and stressed that the new legislations were aimed at benefiting small and marginal farmers. Assuring that the minimum support price (MSP) will continue and the existing mandi system will be strengthened, the minister appealed to the farmers to dismiss “white lies being spread by politically motivated people”. Tomar, who is leading the negotiation with about 40 farmer unions along with Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, asserted that there were no provisions in these laws for corporate firms to take control of farmers’ lands. “Many farmers’ unions have supported farm laws. But some farmer groups have created confusion. Being an agriculture minister, it is my duty to remove misconceptions and address concerns of every farmer. It is also my duty to expose the conspiracy being hatched around Delhi and present the truth and facts before you,” he said in the letter. Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at Delhi’s borders against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. At least five rounds of formal talks have been held between three Union ministers and 40 farmer unions to break the deadlock. The unions, however, are demanding complete roll back of the central laws. Last week, the Centre had sent a proposal to these unions, stating that it would give a written assurance that the MSP system will remain and also redress their other key concerns. In the open letter, Tomar highlighted that the government in the last six years has taken various measures to boost farmers' income and make the agriculture sector profitable, including cash transfers under the PM-KISAN scheme and Rs 1 lakh crore agri-infrastructure fund. Stating that about 80 per cent of Indian farmers are small with landholdings of 1-2 acres, Tomar said these three laws will benefit them as it gives them freedom to sell their produce outside the APMC mandis. “It is imperative to understand the conspiracy being hatched by some political parties and organisations. It is unfortunate for the country that some intellectuals, claiming to be neutral, are shamelessly speaking contrary to their earlier positions,” he said. Tomar said he wondered how the Congress government, which did not implement the Swaminathan panel report for 8 years, has started talking about welfare of farmers. He said the Congress in its election manifesto had talked about providing alternative avenues for the sale of farm produce. He also attacked the AAP and Akali Dal for change of their stance with regard to reform in the agriculture marketing system. Tomar also criticised some farmer unions, who had earlier welcomed these new laws but now have joined the protests. The minister cautioned the farmers about the entry of people and organisations that have nothing to do with farming and are “trying to spread anarchy and fuel discontent”. Such elements, he said, were taking advantage of the farm agitation to pressurise the government to release people accused of spreading violence from prison. He said some people even desecrated the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the name of farmers’ protest. The minister said people should understand the motives of those persons who are asking consumers to boycott products of domestic companies at a time when the country was moving towards becoming self-reliant following the government’s call for ‘vocal for local’. Tomar said the people who stopped trains from carrying supplies for army personnel deployed in Leh and Ladakh cannot be called as farmers. The government had to spend taxpayers' money on transporting supplies to the army through air and other modes, he added. Farmers should ponder what was the aim when they started the agitation and what is being talked about now, he said. “Through this letter, I appeal to farmers with folded hands not to fall prey to any falsehood and think on a factual basis only,” the minister said, while asserting that these new laws would lay the foundation of a new chapter to strengthen farmers.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-482
17-12-2020||India||JD(U) likely to contest at least 75 seats in Bengal||Bihar Chief Minister’s Janata Dal (United) is looking forward to contesting a large number of seats at the upcoming Bengal polls, where its ally BJP has high stakes, the party asserted on Thursday. JD(U) national general secretary Ghulam Rasool Baliyavi said that the party unit in Bengal wants to contest in at least 75 seats and the number may go up, if the leadership is approved. Election to the 294-seat Bengal Assembly is expected to be held in April-May next year. The BJP, which had put forward an excellent show in the Lok Sabha polls last year, has been looking to overthrow the Mamata Banerjee government. “We have contested assembly elections in West Bengal in the past. We would like to do so this time also. Our party has carried out massive membership drives in districts such as Malda, Murshidabad, Purulia and Bankura,” Baliyavi said. He said the party was hopeful of doing well in places which have a high percentage of people hailing from Bihar, and claimed that the good governance of Nitish Kumar has created a buzz in the neighbouring state. The JD(U) has been maintaining that its alliance with the BJP was confined to Bihar. The party has fought in states like Karnataka and Gujarat without a tie-up with the BJP, which is in power. In BJP-rule Arunachal Pradesh, the JD(U) is the main opposition party. Similarly in Jharkhand, where BJP lost power last year, the JD(U) had contested separately. However, the JD(U) fought the Delhi assembly polls earlier this year in alliance with the BJP. Addressing a query on these lines, Baliyavi said, “I am of the opinion that the BJP should think in terms of taking Nitish Kumar along. If it chooses otherwise, then every party has the right to expand its own base.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-483
17-12-2020||India||Kejriwal tears up copies of farm laws in Delhi Assembly||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday tore up copies of the three contentious farm laws in the legislative assembly, against which tens of thousands of farmers are protesting near the national capital. He said that he cannot betray the farmers. Addressing the Delhi Assembly, the AAP chief accused the BJP of bringing in the legislations for their own electoral funding and not for farmers. “I am pained that I have to do this. I did not intend to, but I cannot betray the farmers of my country who have been sleeping on the streets in the cold when the temperature is just 2 degrees Celsius,” Kejriwal said as he tore up the copies of the three laws. “I am a citizen of this country first, a chief minister later. This assembly rejects the three laws and appeals to the central government to meet the demands of farmers,” he said. The chief minister further asked the government when it will “wake up”, and said 20 farmers had already died in the protest. Kejriwal said the Centre should not be under the impression that the farmers will simply return to their homes. In 1907, a farmers' protest had continued for nine months till the British rulers repealed some laws, he said. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court on Thursday said it would put together a panel, which may include experts like P Sainath and representatives of the government and farmers' bodies to look for the resolution of the deadlock over the statutes. “We acknowledge the right of farmers to protest but it has to be non-violent,” the bench, comprising justices SA Bobde, AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-483
17-12-2020||India||SC says farmers have right to carry out protests||Acknowledging the right of the farmers to carry out non-violent protests, the Supreme Court on Thursday said it was thinking of setting up an “impartial and independent” committee of agricultural experts and farmers unions to remove the deadlock over the three contentious farm laws. A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde said it would put together a panel, which may include experts like P Sainath and representatives of the government and farmers' bodies to look for the resolution of the deadlock over the statutes. “We acknowledge the right of farmers to protest but it has to be non-violent,” the bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said. In a hearing conducted via video conferencing, the top court said the purpose of staging protest can be achieved if the farmers and the government will hold talks and "we wish to facilitate that". “We will not decide the validity of law today. The only thing which we will decide is the issue of protest and the right to move freely,” the bench observed in the ongoing hearing. The farmers’ protest against the Centre’s three agri-marketing laws at the borders of the national capital entered its fourth week on Thursday amid a cold wave in Delhi. Thousands of farmers, camping at the border points of the city have stuck to their demand of repealing the new laws. The apex court on Wednesday told the Centre that its talks with the farmers’ unions have “not worked apparently” and were bound to fail. However, the protesting leaders dismissed the SC’s suggestion of forming the panel as no solution. There was disruption of traffic movement on key routes in the national capital on Thursday, the 22nd day of the farmers' protest to demand for the repeal of the three new agri marketing laws. The top court on Wednesday also issued notices to the Centre and eight farmers’ organisations. The farmers’ organisations issued with notices are the BKU (Rakesh Tikait faction), BKU Sidhupur (Jagjeet Singh Dallewal), BKU Rajewal (Balbeer Singh Rajewal), BKU Lakhowal (Harinder Singh Lakhowal), Jamhoori Kisan Sabha (Kulwant Singh Sandhu), BKU Dakaunda (Buta Singh Burjgill), BKU Doaba (Manjit Singh Rai), and Kul Hind Kisan Federation (Prem Singh Bhangu). The bench has been hearing two petitions moved by law student Rishabh Sharma and advocate G.S. Mani. While Sharma has sought eviction of the farmers massed on Delhi’s borders citing the hardship to commuters, Mani has requested quashing of the new farm laws as illegal and an immediate resolution of the dispute. Petitioner Sharma, the law student, has argued that blocking public roads is illegal and violates the recent Supreme Court judgment relating to the Shaheen Bagh protest in Delhi against the new citizenship regime. The apex court had ruled that protests that block roads are illegal and such demonstrations can be held only at designated sites.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-483

17-12-2020||India||UP govt loses battle against Kafeel Khan in SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday said it will not interfere with the verdict of the Allahabad High Court, which had quashed Dr Kafeel Khan’s detention under the National Security Act (NSA). The court had ordered his immediate release. A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde termed the judgement as very good, while it was hearing the Uttar Pradesh government’s plea challenging the September 1 verdict of the HC. “We will not interfere in the judgement. However, the observation will not impact any other proceedings,” the bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the state, told the apex court that the high court’s decision acquits Khan in the criminal proceedings. “Criminal cases will be decided on their own merits,” the bench said. Kafeel Khan took to Twitter on Thursday and thanked everyone who supported him. "And thank to everyone across globe who prayed for me ," he wrote. He had hit the headlines after the 2017 tragedy at Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College, in which several children died due to a lack of oxygen cylinders. Initially, he was hailed as a saviour for arranging emergency oxygen cylinders but later faced action along with nine other doctors and staff members of the hospital, all of whom were released on bail later. In its September 1 verdict, the high court had ordered Khan’s immediate release, saying his speech at the AMU didn't promote hatred or violence and gave a call for national integrity. The high court had said that the Aligarh district magistrate, who had passed the order for Khan's detention, did a “selective reading” of his speech, “ignoring its true intent”. The high court had allowed the petition filed by Khan's mother, Nuzhat Parveen, and said the detention order by the district magistrate was illegal.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-483
17-12-2020||India||India signs seven deals with Bangladesh amid upswing in relations||India and Bangladesh on Thursday sealed seven pacts amid their rapidly growing ties, to expand cooperation in several areas. They also restored a cross-border rail link, which was operational till 1965. In a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina, the countries vowed to restore the Chilahati-Haldibari railway link and signed the pacts providing for cooperation in areas of hydrocarbons, agriculture and textiles among others. Modi and Hasina jointly inaugurated a digital exhibition on Bangladesh's founder Mujibur Rahman and Mahatma Gandhi in an effort to celebrate the life and legacies of the two iconic leaders. The Chilahati-Haldibari rail track inauguration is expected to better the connectivity between Assam and Bengal from Bangladesh. It was part of the broad gauge main route from Kolkata to Siliguri till 1965. In his initial statements, Modi said Bangladesh is a key pillar of India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy and it has been an important priority for him to strengthen ties between the two countries. “We feel proud to celebrate 'Bijoy Dibosh' with you to mark Bangladesh's historic victory over anti-liberation forces,” Modi said, adding that the ties between India and Bangladesh have remained good despite the coronavirus pandemic. “It has been a challenging year due to the epidemic. But it is a matter of satisfaction that India and Bangladesh had good cooperation in this difficult time,” the prime minister said. “We are also having good cooperation in the field of vaccines. We will also take special care of your needs in this regard,” he said about the coronavirus vaccine. Modi also thanked Hasina for inviting him to visit Bangladesh next year. “Thank you for the invitation to visit Bangladesh next year. It would be a matter of pride for me to pay tribute to Bangabandhu with you. Bangladesh is a major pillar of our 'Neighbourhood First' policy,” he said. Hasina in her remarks called India a “true friend”. “I pay deep homage to the three million martyrs who laid down their lives. I pay tribute to the members of the Indian armed forces martyred in the war and to their families. I pay my gratitude to the government and the people of India who extended their whole hearted support for the cause of our nation,” she said. The ties between India and Bangladesh have witnessed an upswing in the last few years. Both sides have scaled up trade and economic engagement besides implementing a number of connectivity and infrastructure projects.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-483
17-12-2020||India||SC to pass judgement over contempt proceedings against Kunal Kamra on Dec 18||The Supreme Court on Thursday said it will pronounce its order on Friday on a batch of petitions seeking initiation of criminal contempt proceedings against stand-up comic artist Kunal Kamra for his alleged scandalous tweets against the apex court. The pleas came up for hearing before a bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan which heard the submissions of advocate Nishant R Katneshwarkar, who appeared for one of the petitioners and claimed that Kamra had posted several tweets scandalous to the judiciary. "All these tweets are scandalous and we had sought consent from the attorney general," Katneshwarkar told the bench, which also comprised justices R S Reddy and M R Shah. He read out the letter of Attorney General K K Venugopal, who had granted consent for initiation of criminal contempt proceedings against Kamra. The bench asked the lawyer not to read the alleged contemptuous tweets of the comic artist in the open court, saying they have already gone through Venugopal's letter on the issue. The consent of either the attorney general or the solicitor general is necessary under section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 for initiating contempt proceedings against a person. One of the petitions have been filed by a law student, Shrirang Katneshwarkar, who has claimed that Kamra had started publishing tweets on November 11, when the top court was hearing the appeal of journalist Arnab Goswami against the Bombay High Court's order rejecting his plea seeking interim bail in a 2018 abetment to suicide case.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-483
17-12-2020||India||Cold winds continue in Delhi, cold day conditions at certain places||Despite clear skies and lots of sunshine, the minimum temperature remained close to four degrees Celsius in most parts of the national capital on Thursday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum temperature of 4.6 degrees Celsius as frosty winds from the western Himalayas continued to sweep across Delhi. The Ayanagar and Ridge weather stations recorded minimum temperatures of 3.8 degrees Celsius and 3.5 degrees Celsius, respectively. The maximum temperature is likely to settle around 18 degrees Celsius, the IMD said, predicting 'cold day' conditions at a few places. The IMD had declared a cold wave in Delhi on Tuesday as icy winds blowing from snow-covered western Himalayas brought the minimum temperature down to 4.1 degrees Celsius, the lowest in the city this season so far. According to the IMD, the minimum temperature is likely to remain around five degrees Celsius till Friday. Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said the western Himalayas recorded widespread snowfall due to strong western disturbances and now frosty winds have been blowing towards the plains, bringing the mercury down. For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days. "However, for small areas such as Delhi, a cold wave can be declared if the criteria is fulfilled even for a day," Srivastava said. A "cold day" is when the minimum temperature is less than 10 degrees Celsius and the maximum is 4.4 degrees Celsius below normal. The air quality was recorded in the "poor" category. The city's air quality index (AQI) was 248 at 11 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 262 on Wednesday and 230 on Tuesday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-483
17-12-2020||India||Ayodhya Masjid blueprint to be revealed on Saturday||The foundation of the mosque at Ayodhya to replace the Babri Masjid will be laid on Republic Day on the five-acre land allotted, while its blueprint will be revealed on Saturday, members of the Trust formed for its construction said. “The Trust chose January 26, 2021 for laying the foundation stone of the Ayodhya mosque as on this day our Constitution came into effect over seven decades ago. Our Constitution is based on pluralism, which is the leitmotif of our mosque project,” Athar Hussain, secretary of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF), said. The Sunni Waqf Board created the IICF six months ago and tasked it with building the mosque. As finalised by chief architect Professor SM Akhtar, the blueprint of the mosque will be revealed on December 19. It includes a multi-speciality hospital, a community kitchen and a library as parts. “The mosque will have a capacity to hold 2,000 namazis at a time, and the structure will be round-shaped,” Akhtar told PTI. The Supreme Court on November 9 last year had paved the way for the construction of a Ram Temple at the disputed Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid site at Ayodhya, and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a ‘prominent’ place in the town in Uttar Pradesh. The UP government allotted a five-acre land in Dhannipur village in Sohaval Tehsil of Ayodhya. “The new mosque will be bigger than Babri Masjid, but won't be a lookalike of the structure. The hospital will take centre stage in the complex. It will serve humanity in the true spirit of Islam as taught by the Prophet in his last sermon 1,400 years ago,” Akhtar said. “The hospital won't be a usual concrete structure but will be in sync with the architecture of the mosque, replete with calligraphy and Islamic symbols. It will house a 300-bed speciality unit, where doctors will work with missionary zeal to provide free treatment to the ailing,” he said, adding, “The mosque will be self efficient for power as it is designed based on solar energy and a natural temperature maintenance system.” “When we talk about the hospital project at Dhannipur, one thing is sure that it will be a multi speciality hospital,” Hussain said. “The community kitchen will serve good quality meals twice a day to cater to the needs of nourishment of the poor people living nearby,” he added. “We can establish a nursing and paramedic college to provide human resources to the hospital. We can manage doctors from local resources from Faizabad, and for specialised needs in terms of critical surgeries, we have a group of doctor friends in prominent government and private institutions who want to offer their services,” he said. “We are looking forward to corporate funding for the hospital. There are many donors who are willing to contribute when we have 80 G approval. After that, we will go for FCRA and seek foreign funds from Muslims of Indian origin,” the IICF secretary added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-483

The total number of cases increased to 99,56,557 as the death toll mounted to 1,44,451 with 355 new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am showed. The number of people who have recuperated from the disease surged to 94,89,740 pushing the national recovery rate to 95.31 per cent,while the Covid-19 case fatality rate stands at 1.45 per cent. The active caseload of coronavirus remained below four lakh for the eleventh consecutive day, with 3,22,366 people being affected from the disease at the moment. This comprises  3.24 per cent of the total caseload, the data stated. India's Covid-19 tally had crossed the 20-lakh mark on August 7, 30 lakh on August 23 and 40 lakh on September 5. It went past 50 lakh on September 16, 60 lakh on September 28, 70 lakh on October 11, crossed 80 lakh on October 29, and surpassed 90 lakh on November 20.

17-12-2020||India||Scientists hoping to harness convalescent plasma to fight Covid||A medical trial in Calcutta and others in India and around the world suggest antibody-rich blood plasma from patients who’ve recovered from Covid-19 can be used to combat the virus and, if administered early, keep people out of intensive care. The Calcutta study was based on 80 patients at the West Bengal state-run ID&BG Hospital that took place between end-May and end-October. Crucially, it found administering plasma therapy produced “significant immediate mitigation of hypoxia (when oxygen falls to dangerously low levels), reduction in the hospital stay as well as survival benefits” in severely ill COVID-19 patients with Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDs). “It is a therapy that works” in many cases, says Dipyaman Ganguly, principal scientist, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology. Ganguly led the convalescent plasma therapy study which was conducted by the ID&BG Hospital, under a joint initiative of the Centre of Scientific Research (CSIR) and the West Bengal government. The central hope is that antibody therapy could stop mild Covid from turning severe. While vaccines now are being approved for Covid, it will be months before many people are able to get them and, in the meantime, scientists are hoping to harness the immune system’s natural response to viral invaders. The study shows “plasma will provide antibodies that will prevent the virus from infecting cells … (and that) other proteins also are circulating which we think are also playing a role in the recovery,” he says. Those patients the therapy benefited were aged below 67 years, said the study. The Calcutta findings got a shoutout tweet from Dr Arturo Casadevall, chairman of the immunology department at the US Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and who has been a big advocate of the use of convalescent plasma therapy to treat Covid. Casadevall has been running trials that indicate convalescent plasma is most useful in preventing the onset of severe illness or to prevent symptoms completely than as a cure for Covid when it reaches an advanced stage. “Early use is associated with the best outcome,” he says. Convalescent plasma therapy involves extracting antibodies from the blood of recovered Covid patients and injecting it into coronavirus patients to combat the virus and also into people at risk of contracting the illness. The low-cost therapy itself is a century-old one used before the emergence of antibiotics made convalescent plasma largely obsolete. It won the Nobel Prize in 1901 for curing diphtheria in children. In recent years, doctors have used plasma to treat Ebola, SARS and MERS when nothing else worked. The beauty of convalescent plasma treatment is that its use “requires no research or development,” as it “relies on standard blood-banking practices,” says Casadavell. While vaccines should confer long-lasting immunity by triggering the recipient to create their own antibodies, receiving antibodies would only get temporary Covid immunity. Privately run Max Super Speciality Hospital also has just published a study on patients in the intensive care unit that were administered plasma therapy and which showed “mortality was significantly lower in the plasma group.” That study focused on late-stage Covid patients -- some 694 patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit. Of these, 333 were given plasma with the best supportive care and the remaining 361 received the best supportive care only. That study found that the mortality rate in Covid patients administered plasma was 25.5 per cent against 33.2 per cent among those who did not receive the plasma. Unlike some other studies, this found good outcomes in relatively late usage of plasma therapy. This benefit of reduced mortality was most seen in those aged 60 to 74 years -- 26.7 per cent versus 43.0 per cent. Women in this age group seemed to benefit especially from plasma treatment. There was also a “significant difference” in mortality observed in patients with one comorbidity (22.3 per cent against 36.5 per cent). Moreover, patients on ventilators had significantly lower mortality rates in the plasma group, 37.2 per cent against 49.3 per cent in the non-plasma group. The plasma effect was particularly marked for patients who were on mechanical ventilation. The death rate in the plasma group was 63.9 per cent against 82.9 per cent for those in the non-plasma group. These findings conflict with the conclusions of an ICMR double-blind trial that involved 433 participants. The study covered 39 hospitals across India. ICMR reported convalescent plasma was “not associated with a reduction in progress to severe Covid-19 or all-cause mortality… we did not find any benefit from convalescent plasma being administered within three days of symptom onset in Covid-19.” In its study, the ICMR noted some possible drawbacks including the fact that most of the donors only had mild Covid and that it could not measure the antibody levels in the convalescent plasma before giving it to patients because reliable tests for antibody measurement weren’t available when the trial began. The ICMR researchers noted that those people who had severe Covid were reluctant to return to the hospital to donate plasma. “This has major implications for obvious operational reasons in the scaling up of convalescent plasma treatment for Covid-19 not only in India but also globally,” the ICMR said. A US study suggests that 30 per cent of documented Covid patients are not making enough antibodies to qualify for plasma donation as they have mild cases. Ultimately, some researchers say while plasma might be useful right now, in the long-run, it might be more advantageous to identify the best antibodies to Covid, then synthesise them in labs. These are known as "monoclonal antibodies" and they are being developed by biotech firms including Regeneron and Eli Lilly. US President Trump received a drug produced by Regeneron. High levels of antibodies in the donated plasma are seen by Casadevall, the Johns Hopkins immunologist, and other researchers as being critical to plasma therapy being effective. High antibody levels occur in people who have had a fairly severe bout of Covid-19. Secondly, in patients treated early, mortality rates are lowest when the plasma contains high antibody levels. The mortality rates are highest in patients who received low antibody plasma, and somewhere around the middle when levels of antibody are in the intermediate range. Recovered patients can become donors after three-to-four weeks of testing negative. The ICMR said in a later statement later that a potential donor for convalescent plasma should have sufficient concentration of neutralising antibodies before giving it to patients In Kuwait, meanwhile, an observational study found significant reductions in mortality with high antibody convalescent plasma if it is given within 24 hours of hospital admission. Another study carried out in the Bronx in New York City found that plasma recipients suffering from severe Covid-19 had a four-fold lower mortality rate at day 28 of the disease. A further double-blind study in Argentina funded by The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation of 160 elderly subjects over the age of 64 found that administration of high-antibody convalescent plasma against Covid to mildly ill infected seniors within 72 hours of mild Covid symptoms reduced the virus’s progression. Meanwhile, early findings of a US study, which enrolled more than 35,000 patients, found that quickly administering so-called convalescent plasma had a marked effect on mortality for patients with severe cases of Covid-19. Those who received transfusions within three days of diagnosis had a seven-day death rate of 8.7 per cent, while patients who got plasma after four or more days had a mortality rate of 11.9 per cent in the study, run by the Mayo Clinic. The study enrolled a high proportion of critically ill patients, with about 52 per cent in intensive care units and 28 per cent requiring mechanical help to breathe. In this study, researchers also found that the quality of the plasma infusion had an effect on patient outcomes, as those who got infusions that were particularly rich with antibodies fared better overall. While doctors like best to rely on randomised control studies, observational trials also can be useful. The efficacy of penicillin is an example of a drug accepted without randomised trials. “In this kind of treatment, there will be some who respond and some who don’t,” says Ganguly. “There’s a need to categorise them and how to recognise parameters of a responder,” he says.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-484
17-12-2020||India||Supreme Court to form panel on farmers' agitation||The Supreme Court on Wednesday decided to form a committee to resolve the farmers’ agitation, saying the government’s negotiations would “again fail” and the dispute would “soon become a national issue” if allowed to fester. After taking on itself the responsibility to broker a possible settlement, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde listed the matter for urgent hearing on Thursday. It issued notices to the Centre and eight farmers’ organisations. Earlier, when solicitor-general Tushar Mehta suggested that senior ministers were holding talks “regularly” and insinuated that the farmers’ stand was opaque, Justice Bobde cut him short. “Your talks will again fail…. It seems the government may not be able to work out a solution. The issue will soon become a national issue,” he said. Tens of thousands of farmers have besieged Delhi’s borders in protest against three new farm laws that they say would deprive them of the minimum support price and leave them to be exploited by big companies. The farmers’ organisations issued with notices are the BKU (Rakesh Tikait faction), BKU Sidhupur (Jagjeet Singh Dallewal), BKU Rajewal (Balbeer Singh Rajewal), BKU Lakhowal (Harinder Singh Lakhowal), Jamhoori Kisan Sabha (Kulwant Singh Sandhu), BKU Dakaunda (Buta Singh Burjgill), BKU Doaba (Manjit Singh Rai), and Kul Hind Kisan Federation (Prem Singh Bhangu). Other farmers’ organisations can also apply to be impleaded in the matter. The bench, which included Justices A.S. Bopanna and V. Ramasubramanian, passed the directions on two petitions moved by law student Rishabh Sharma and advocate G.S. Mani. While Sharma has sought eviction of the farmers massed on Delhi’s borders citing the hardship to commuters, Mani has requested quashing of the new farm laws as illegal and an immediate resolution of the dispute. Justice Bobde told Mehta, who was appearing for the Centre, that the petitions were “ill-conceived”, yet the court would like to constitute a committee as the talks held by the government so far had failed. “The petitions seem to be ill-conceived. The only party before us is you (the Centre) — who has blocked the road is you, (the) government,” Justice Bobde remarked in a lighter vein. Mehta said it was not the government but the farmers who had blocked the roads. “We have been holding talks regularly, but their (agitators’) approach is ‘either repeal the act or don’t repeal it’. It is either yes or no,” he said. “The ministers of agriculture, home and other senior ministers had discussed with them but they have turned their backs on us.” While the government has offered to amend the contentious laws, the farmers have stood firm on their demand for wholesale repeal. Justice Bobde, saying the talks were likely to fail again, added: “Mr Mehta, what we are planning to do is form a committee to resolve the issue. It will have members from the farmers’ organisations and government of India. There can be representations from others….” To a query from the bench, Mehta said that as far as he knew, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) was at the forefront of the protests. The court asked him to furnish details of the various groups involved in the agitation so that notices could be issued to them. Mehta then furnished a list of organisations. Petitioner Sharma, the law student, has argued that blocking public roads is illegal and violates the recent Supreme Court judgment relating to the Shaheen Bagh protest in Delhi against the new citizenship regime. The apex court had ruled that protests that block roads are illegal and such demonstrations can be held only at designated sites.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-484
17-12-2020||India||Farmers protest: Women in yellow dupattas say 'This is war, prime minister'||The women are gathered in a group, clapping to keep the beat as one of them leads with a boli (couplet). The telltale signs say it could be a Punjabi wedding but the lyrics don’t mock-attack the in-laws. Main chaa wich paaya dudh, Modi ne chhed leyaa hun juddh. Ji, tussi ki piyonge. Chorus: Ik cup chaa. (I have added milk to tea, Modi has now started a war. Tell me, what will you have? Chorus: One cup of tea.) Neither is the venue the lit-up home of a bride or groom; it is a protest site of farmers on the road. The women are turned out in yellow dupattas invoking the revolutionary Bhagat Singh, and their message is for the Prime Minister: “This is war.” Chalo Dilli nu chaliye, othhe laa daiyye dharna, Modi ne kanoon banaye, assaan e kanoon nahiyo jarna, chahe Modi aaje …assaan nahiyo darna, chalo Dilli chaliye, jaake Modi nu gheriye…. (Come, let’s go to Delhi, let’s sit on a dharna there, Modi has made laws, we won’t let the laws stand, let Modi come… we won’t fear, let’s go to Delhi, let’s gherao Modi.) This sounds like a protest song but the singer shimmers in bright silk and gota (gold lace), dressed for a wedding, as are the men and women around, who are breaking into laughter at the tweaking of the lyrics of a popular number for the performance. The mandatory cheering and dancing that accompanies a baraat on its way to bring home the bride are making their presence felt but the message again is for the Prime Minister: “We won’t let the laws stand.” Protest and celebration have dovetailed — as good a yardstick as any to measure the depth of the farmers’ movement standing at Delhi’s door. Ask any child in Punjab what the protests are about and the reply comes without hesitation: “Modi is trying to rob us of our rights and our land.” They are speaking from the knowledge that comes from listening in to conversations of elders as children are wont to do. “Modiji, we are Jatt, Jatts give their lives for their land, don’t you try to take our land from us,” a chubby little girl warns in a video that went viral sometime ago. That the government has in its talks now offered to bring “clarity” in the law on contract farming and bar confiscation of land suggests this is being recognised as a real fear. What videos circulating on social media reveal is that the farm laws are dominating everyday conversation in Punjab, and that the opinion against them is overwhelming and that it is informed. Until recently, few experts have highlighted that the laws deny the farmers the right to legal recourse for a breach in contract, directing them to bureaucrats instead of civil courts. But in bites to television reporters milling about the protest sites many a farmer has pointed this out and asked if government officials can be expected to rule against an Ambani or an Adani or any other powerful corporate house. Modi and his government say the laws are pro-farmer. They ask farmers not to be “misled” by the Opposition, by “Khalistanis”, by “Maoists”, by the “Tukde Tukde gang”. The woman in the yellow dupatta sings: “Main chaa wich paaie elaichi, Modi di chalan ni deni chalaki. Ji, tussi ki piyonge?” (I have put cardamom in the tea, we won’t let Modi’s cunning succeed. What will you have?) Laughing, the women around her chorus: “Ik cup chaa.” On a wedding video that made it to television news, an announcement is heard: the shagun (cash gift) that guests give the newlyweds will be sent to the farmers’ protest. Sportspersons, singers, academics, writers, veterans, a crop scientist, politicians and faceless multitudes have rallied behind the farmers to contribute in any way they can — with their voice, with cash, with rations and woollens, or with seva (voluntary service) that could mean cooking or cleaning or doing the laundry at the site, offering health check-ups, or simply making and sending batches of pinni (laddu) for them from home. The tractor trailers parked for miles on the highway outside heavily barricaded Delhi are for everyone to see, but behind these unseen is the will of the entire state. Another video, another child, who starts respectfully with a “Sat Sri Akal, Modiji” and introduces herself as Seerat Kaur before she chides the Prime Minister: “Modiji, you asked us to clap and we clapped. You asked us to bang thalis and we banged thalis. You asked us to light diyas and candles, and we lit those. Corona can’t even be seen, but in spite of that we did what you told us. Now all these farmers are sitting in the cold outside Delhi, and everyone can see them, why don’t you then do what is needed to solve the problem?” The protest outside Delhi is not Punjab’s alone. There are tens of thousands of farmers from Haryana, thousands from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, and many have travelled from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha and other corners of the country even in the absence of regular trains. But it is a protest led by Punjab, whose livelihood and way of life revolves around farming. After two months of agitating in vain at home, the state’s farmers piled rations and blankets onto tractor trailers and set out for Delhi in the last week of November. “Dilli Chalo.” Farmers from Haryana were quick to follow, and now there are participants from many parts of India. Ask how long they will sit on dharna, and the assured refrain is: “We have enough food. We have brought supplies to last six months and more are coming.” It is this that the protesters, proud farmers, are fighting to save: food security. If there is one dominating visual of this protest, it is that of the langar. Dal and vegetables and roti cooking in huge utensils, pakodas and jalebis being fried, people eating, tea being served, including some to the policemen manning the barricades to keep the protesters out of Delhi. There is enough food for everyone. And there is more. A langar of chaat and golgappas sponsored by one village, of pizzas started by other villages, of Maggi that was a hit with kids, of cashews and raisins sent by a supporter, and a langar of peanuts offered by one frail and elderly farmer. Where are the resources for these coming from, the trolls ask? No, India’s farmers don’t need funding from Pakistan or China to eat pizza. The resources come from the same place as those for the langars the gurdwaras ran for the countless migrant labourers left starving by the sudden lockdown in March. The same langars that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had acknowledged at the time. Those community kitchens were fuelled by the sense of religious duty to feed the hungry and by empathy for those less fortunate. The langars at Delhi’s border now are powered by the farmers themselves, by their families and friends, by neighbours and fellow villagers, by the community they are a part of, the gurdwaras that they give a share of every harvest to. How long will you be here, a BBC journalist asks a mother who has left her children with her in-laws as she and her husband joined the protests. “As long as Modi Sahab wants us to be here,” she laughs. “It is for him to decide how long he wants to keep people on the roads. There are seven-year-olds here and those above 90, in the cold.” Night temperature in Delhi is now touching 5 degrees Celsius and on the highway, it would be lower. Those that can, sleep in their covered tractor trailers or underneath them. But there are many who sleep in the open, with just a blanket, and little to shield against rain when it comes as it did in a light spell last week. The assertion, “We would rather die than go back without repeal of the laws,” is not an empty refrain. At least 15 protesters have died in 20 days. The farmers know what they are up against. That they are turning road dividers on the highway into kitchen gardens, planting onions, coriander, spinach and other vegetables, is proof they know this is going to be a long haul. A few kilometres from where the farmers are camped, in the heart of Delhi, stands Sis Ganj Sahib. The gurdwara was built at the site where Guru Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Sikh guru, was beheaded on Aurangzeb’s orders for resisting religious persecution of the Sikhs and the Hindus. Sis translates as head. The anniversary of his martyrdom is this week. Days after that it will be time for the Shaheedi Jor Mela in Punjab’s Fatehgarh Sahib, where lakhs gather every year to remember the martyrdom of the two younger sons of the 10th Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, and be inspired by it. The boys, both under 10, had refused to be converted by force and were entombed alive. Had the farmers who led the march on Delhi not been at the protests now, many would have been heading to Fatehgarh Sahib with their children and grandchildren to ensure another generation learns the lesson of valour and sacrifice and of resistance against persecution, and grows up with the conviction that each one should be able to take on a lakh and a quarter in the battle for justice.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-484
17-12-2020||India||India slips two notches in latest Human Development Index||India has slipped two notches, to 131st place, in the latest Human Development Index (HDI) rankings published by the United Nations Development Programme although most of its neighbours have improved their scores. The Human Development Report 2020 has placed India in the 131st position among 189 countries, down from the 129th last year. Bhutan, ranked 134th last year, has leapfrogged India to the 129th spot. The HDI measures achievements in life expectancy, education and per capita income. The report found that India’s gross national income per capita had fallen to $6,681 (Rs 4.9 lakh) in 2019 from $6,829 (Rs 5.03 lakh) in 2018 on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP). The PPP is a measurement for prices in different countries in terms of the purchasing power of the currency for specific goods. Nepal has risen from 147th last year to 142nd, Bangladesh from 135th to 133rd and Afghanistan from 170th to 169th. Like India, Pakistan has slipped two notches from 152nd last year, while Sri Lanka has climbed down one spot to 72nd. China continues at 85th. Among Brics countries, Russia is 52nd while Brazil is ranked 84th. Norway tops the HDI list, followed by Ireland and Switzerland. Atul Sood, professor at the Centre for the Study of Regional Development at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), attributed India’s poor ranking to its growth-oriented policy that lacks specific focus on social-sector outcomes. “In India, there is a thinking that economic growth will automatically result in social development. The global experience suggests the reverse. Growth does not automatically percolate down to ensure development in education, health or gender. Other countries, particularly our neighbours like Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, laid specific emphasis on social-sector outcomes,” Sood said. He said there should be higher investment in education and health. But in India, the government is gradually withdrawing from public education and health systems, Sood felt. The government expects the private sector to take the lead role in providing health and education, he said. “The slide in global ranking is proof that private investment is unlikely to deliver gains in the social sector,” Sood said. After two decades of progress, the number of people affected by hunger has been increasing since the low of 628 million in 2014. In 2019, the number was 688 million, up 60 million in only five years, the UNDP report said. Estimates for 2020, including the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic, range from 780 million people affected by hunger to 829 million. By 2030, a total of 900 million people could be undernourished. In 2019, two billion people were moderately or severely food insecure, 367 million more than in 2014, according to the UNDP. The report attributed the food insecurity to stagnant or deteriorating economic conditions, weak positions in global value chains and large inequalities in the distribution of income, assets and resources. The report also underlined the effects of climate change. In 2019, some 25 million people worldwide were internally displaced because of natural hazards. Disasters continued to trigger most new displacements in 2020. Cyclone Amphan hit India and Bangladesh, driving the largest single displacement event in the first half of the year and triggering 3.3 million pre-emptive evacuations, the report said. Some estimates indicate that 1 billion people worldwide could face forced displacement by 2050. The number of people vulnerable to permanent sea-level rise is estimated to increase from 110 million now to more than 200 million by 2100, the report said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-484
17-12-2020||India||When India’s virus trains rolled||The crowds surged through the gates, fought their way up the stairs of the 160-year-old station, poured across the platforms and engulfed the trains. It was May 5, around 10am. Surat was beastly hot, 41°C. Thousands of migrant labourers were frantic to leave — loom operators, diamond polishers, mechanics, truck drivers, cooks, cleaners, the backbone of Surat’s economy. Two of them were Rabindra and Prafulla Behera, brothers and textile workers, who had arrived in Surat a decade ago in search of opportunity and were now fleeing disease and death. Rabindra stepped aboard carrying a bag stuffed with chapatis. His older brother, Prafulla, clattered in behind, dragging a plastic suitcase packed with pencils, toys, lipstick for his wife and 13 dresses for his girls. “You really think we should be doing this?” Prafulla asked. “What else are we going to do?” Rabindra said. “We have nothing to eat and our money’s out.” They were among tens of millions of migrant workers stranded without work or food after Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a national coronavirus lockdown in March. By spring and summer, these workers were so desperate that the government provided emergency trains to carry them back to their home villages. The trains were called Shramik Specials, because shramik means “labourer” in Hindi. But they became the virus trains. India has now reported more coronavirus cases than any country besides the US. And it has become clear that the special trains operated by the government to ease suffering — and to counteract a disastrous lack of lockdown planning — instead played a significant role in spreading the coronavirus into almost every corner of the country. The trains became contagion zones: every passenger was supposed to be screened for Covid-19 before boarding but few if any were tested. Social distancing, if promised, was nonexistent, as men pressed into passenger cars for journeys that could last days. Then the trains disgorged passengers into distant villages, in regions that before had few if any coronavirus cases. One of those places was Ganjam, a lush, rural district on the Bay of Bengal, where the Behera brothers disembarked after their crowded trip from Surat. Untouched by the virus, Ganjam soon became one of India’s most heavily infected rural districts after the migrants started returning. Many people in Ganjam’s villages had no idea what coronavirus symptoms were — until people around them started dying. “There was a very direct correlation between the active Covid cases and the trains,” said Keerthi Vasan V., a district-level civil servant in Ganjam. “It was obvious that the returnees brought the virus.” The tragic irony is that Modi’s lockdown inadvertently unlocked an exodus of tens of millions. His government and especially his Covid-19 task force, dominated by upper-caste Hindus, never adequately contemplated how shutting down the economy and quarantining 1.3 billion people would introduce desperation, then panic and then chaos for millions of migrant workers at the heart of Indian industry. A top economic adviser to Modi, Sanjeev Sanyal, confirmed that the administration had been aware of the risks posed by moving people from urban hot spots to rural areas but said that the situation had been managed “quite well”. Railroad officials also insist that the trains were the safest way to get migrant workers home. “India has done extraordinarily well in managing the spread of disease compared to some of the materially most advanced countries of the world,” said D.J. Narain, a railway ministry spokesperson In all, the government organised 4,621 Shramik Specials, moving more than 6 million people. As they poured out of India’s cities, which were becoming hot spots, many returnees dragged the virus with them, yet they kept coming. Surat, an industrial hub, saw more than half a million workers leave on the trains. “It felt like doomsday,” said Ram Singhasan, a ticket collector. “When you saw how many people were thronged outside, it looked like the end of the world was coming.”  On March 24, at 8pm, Modi hit the lockdown switch. In a televised address, he ordered the entire nation to stay inside their homes for three weeks — starting in four hours. The decision was pure Modi: sudden, dramatic and firm, like when he abruptly wiped out nearly 90 per cent of the country’s currency bills in 2016, a bolt-from-the-blue measure that he said was necessary to fight corruption but proved economically devastating. Prafulla and Rabindra Behera had just finished a dinner of rice, lentils and potatoes, their usual fare. They lived in squalid, bare rooms in Surat’s industrial zone, sleeping wall to wall on the floor with a half dozen other labourers. Within minutes of Modi’s address, they started getting calls. “Everyone was thinking the same: This will be over soon and somehow we’ll pass the days,” Rabindra said. At the time, India had fewer than 600 known virus cases. Many experts have criticised Modi’s government for overlooking the plight of migrant labourers, who suddenly had no work, no income and no support network in the cities. The government’s Covid-19 task force lacked migrant specialists and was hardly representative of India. Of its 21 members, only two were women and the rest were largely upper-caste men. Many of the migrant labourers came from lower castes and economically underprivileged backgrounds. Harsh Vardhan, Union health minister, responded by saying that “not even in our wildest imaginations do we think about the caste” and that the task force’s members had been chosen for their “competence, capabilities and intellectual abilities”. Modi’s lockdown closed all public transport, and immediately, some migrants began walking hundreds of miles, desperate to return to their home villages, where living was cheaper and they could find family support. After Modi declared a second lockdown in mid-April, the stream of migrants turned into a humanitarian disaster. Tens of millions poured out of the cities, and India’s airwaves were dominated by horrific scenes of migrants and their families dying along the roads, from thirst, heat, hunger and exhaustion. In New Delhi, railroad officials concluded there was no way to stop the migrants, said Arun Kumar, the head of the railroad police. “And we knew that one day or another, we would have to carry them,” he said. The country’s railroads ferried more than 8 billion passengers a year before the pandemic, traversing a network of 42,253 miles of track, enough to go around the earth nearly twice. It’s one of the world’s busiest train networks, the blood vessels of this country. Pressure was growing on Modi to use it. Naveen Patnaik, the chief minister of Odisha, which includes Ganjam, said he spoke to Modi about the plight of migrants. “I knew that in this chronic situation that they would want to come home,” Patnaik said. The trains, he said, were the answer, but he emphasised that the key thing would be to bring back the workers “gradually”. In Surat, the Behera brothers were down to their last bag of rice. They could not work — the factories were closed. But they weren’t allowed to leave the city, where virus cases were beginning to surge. “We were trapped,” Rabindra said. On May 1, Labour Day, the railways ministry made a grand announcement: Shramik Specials. Routes were drawn up from Surat, Mumbai, Chennai, New Delhi, Ahmedabad and other cities deep into rural areas. But Prafulla Behera, 39, was reluctant to get on a train. There was no work back in Ganjam — that’s why he had left in the first place. Prafulla was respected back home, known to be both strong and affectionate. He never complained about having four daughters, even though just about everyone in the village wants sons. His younger brother, Rabindra, 32, usually did what Prafulla asked. But this time, Rabindra pushed back. “If we’re going to die,” Rabindra said, “we should die at home.” The Behera brothers rode for 27 hours across the width of India, about a thousand miles, in a second-class, non-air-conditioned train packed to capacity. The heat seemed to be getting to Prafulla. During the journey, he complained of having a fever. They stepped off in Ganjam on May 6, around 1pm, exhausted and dehydrated, among the first wave of migrants to return. Far from any major city, Ganjam is a socially conservative, underdeveloped district with endless rice fields, empty beaches and a long tradition of its people pulling for each other. Initially, the news that loved ones were coming home was greeted with excitement. “There was no fear,” said Santosh Kumar Padhy, a block chairman. “The villagers were planning welcome ceremonies.” Ganjam’s officials hurriedly converted hundreds of schools into quarantine centres, drafted a work force of 10,000 people and adapted their freight train station to handle the Shramik Specials, which were longer than typical passenger trains. The Beheras were told they would quarantine for 21 days at a centre and each was given a toothbrush, a slice of soap, a bucket to wash with and a thin sheet to sleep on. But the next morning, Prafulla awoke with a splitting headache. A doctor didn’t think he had coronavirus but suggested, as a precaution, that he be moved into the courtyard, away from the other men. The following morning, Prafulla could barely breathe and called his wife on his cellphone. “Come and bring the girls,” he whispered. “I need to see you.” An hour later, he was dead. A subsequent test revealed that Prafulla Behera was Ganjam’s first coronavirus death. Across the district, people began falling sick. The first dedicated Covid-19 hospital, with fewer than 60 intensive care beds, quickly filled; patients had to be laid out on the floors. Testing was still relatively low but when authorities zeroed in on suspected carriers they found high positivity rates. After Prafulla’s death, Rabindra and six other men who had travelled with him were tested. Six out of seven tested positive. But the Shramik Specials kept coming — four, five, six, sometimes 16 a day, each carrying as many as 2,000 migrants, many from Surat. Across India, state leaders were under pressure from voters urging them to rescue stranded family members. Yet some recognised that the trains could mean trouble. “It will lead to a spike in Covid-19 cases,” predicted Mamata Banerjee,  Bengal’s chief minister, in late May. “Who will take the responsibility then?” A group of researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, submitted a scientific paper in May, which was published a few months later, predicting that virus cases in Bihar would jump by 800 per cent when migrants returned. In New Delhi, health officials warned against packing the trains. There was no way to test most passengers. India was performing about 70,000 tests a day in early May, far fewer than the number of migrants lined up on train platforms some mornings. Passengers were supposed to undergo temperature checks with laser thermometers. Middle seats were supposed to be empty for social distancing. But in Ganjam, trains arrived “more than 100 per cent” full, said Vijay Amruta Kulange, Ganjam’s collector. Ganjam, with a population of around 3.5 million, was absorbing as many as 20,000 migrants a day and didn’t have enough schools to hold everyone. At one overcrowded centre, migrants mutinied, smashing light bulbs and jamming toilets with plastic bottles, trying to be freed. To open up more space, the authorities dropped the quarantine period from 21 days to seven. At the district’s first Covid-19 hospital, Dr. Umashankar Mishra said that at one point, the oxygen supply for 200 patients came within 15 minutes of running out. Mishra called the suppliers in a panic, only to learn that the truck carrying the oxygen cylinders was stuck at a railroad crossing. “I never felt so bad in my life,” Dr Mishra recalled. When the truck finally arrived, Dr Mishra bear-hugged one cylinder and waddled into intensive care. If the truck had arrived any later, he said, “it would have been a massacre”. Workers at the quarantine centres were among the first to get infected. An entire group of cooks in Konkarada village came down with body aches. “We thought it was from working too hard,” said Bonita Pradhan, one of the cooks. She tested positive, as did nine out of 10 of the other cooks. A broader survey in Konkarada found that 80 out of 100 people were coronavirus positive. Across India, the same crisis unfolded: poor communities, with few hospitals, witnessed sharp spikes in infections weeks after the Shramik Specials arrived. “For the virus to reach villages, it needed a carrier, a speedy one,” said Thekkekara Jacob John, a senior virologist in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. “Then came the migrants, and particularly those who travelled by train. They wreaked havoc, wherever they went, unintentionally.” In two rural districts in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, infections surged and are now above 40,000 cases, more than twice India’s per capita average. Similar surges were reported in states such as Nagaland, Bihar, Assam and, especially, in Chhattisgarh. “Eighty per cent of deaths and infections have happened in the rural areas after the arrival of the migrants,” said Tribhuwaneshwar Saran Singh Deo, a minister in Chhattisgarh’s state government. “The first mistake the central policymakers made was not checking the migrants at the station where they started from. The second was to open the flood gates all at once.” In Bihar, state health officials said returning migrants were responsible for 70 per cent of the first wave of infections. “The quarantine centres turned into coronavirus hubs,” said Dr Raj Kishore Chaudhary, a Bihar health official. “If asymptomatic patients would leave the centre without getting detected, the cases would shoot up in areas where they lived.” By the end of June, dozens of villages in Ganjam had been sealed off. Residents were ordered to stay inside. Police officers patrolled the silent lanes. Taxis were converted into ambulances. Volunteers sewed masks, cooked food and answered help calls. At the quarantine centres, schoolteachers led yoga classes. The whole district was mobilised and straining. “Imagine people are coming at 2 or 3 in the night, you receive them, register them, give them their kits, arrange where they will be staying. Doing all this, one gets tired,” admitted Naba Krishna Jena, an officer in the Ganjam government. “So when the crowd grew so big, compromises happened. And because of those compromises, the infections happened and spread.” The trains finally stopped coming to Ganjam on June 30. By then, officials had raised the quarantine period back to 14 days and opened other Covid hospitals but the outbreak was already out of control. In late June, Simanchal Satapathy, a popular teacher who became a champion for the rights of the migrants at the quarantine centre that he oversaw, was admitted to a hospital but misdiagnosed three times: first with malaria, then pneumonia, then tuberculosis. It wasn’t until a week after Satapathy, 26, came down with a high fever that he was tested for coronavirus. He was positive and soon died. “I used to cradle him as a baby,” said his uncle, Pradeep Kumar Satapathy, breaking down. “We had no idea he had Covid.” Ganjam’s caseload peaked in August and, overall, the district has reported 22,000 cases and 320 deaths, roughly the national average, according to Mishra, the physician who ran its Covid-19 hospital. Kulange, the district collector, said Ganjam would have recorded “single-digit cases” had the migrants not come back. “It was clear cut,” he said. Most cases in Ganjam caused only mild symptoms and did not require hospitalisation. But no one is certain of the district’s real death toll, just as that figure remains a mystery across the country. India has reported far fewer virus deaths per capita than many western nations, but experts caution that 80 per cent of all deaths in the country are not medically certified. Patnaik, Odisha’s chief minister, said the Modi administration should have run the trains “in a more humane way” and before infections became so rampant in the cities. But he, too, agreed that once the migration started, it was impossible to stop. “This being a free country, I don’t think there was any way of controlling it,” he said. Railroad officials said they had worked their hardest to safely transport 6.3 million people “in the most trying circumstances”. Asked to respond to the data showing that the virus had spread rapidly in many districts after the trains arrived, Narain, the railroad spokesperson, said much was still unknown about Covid-19 and “correlation of every kind is not necessarily causation”. Vardhan, the Union health minister, said that the Modi administration had started the trains as soon as it could, given that states needed time to prepare quarantine centres first. Opposition politicians have pushed for a parliamentary inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic but members of Modi’s BJP have blocked them. In October, the Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit calling for an independent investigation. In Ganjam, the scars are still fresh. The home where Satapathy, the teacher, lived with his parents is now deserted. After he was told that his son had died, Satapathy’s father went to the market, paid off his debts and came home with a rope. He hanged himself from a tree. Satapathy’s mother also killed herself. She was found hanging from a ceiling fan. Rabindra Behera eventually returned to Surat, by train. His brother had been right: there was no work in Ganjam. And now Prafulla Behera’s widow and four daughters have no one to support them. The plastic suitcase that Prafulla brought home, packed with gifts, was destroyed at the quarantine centre. His daughters never got their 13 dresses.

17-12-2020||India||Bharat Biotech vaccine generates 'robust' immune responses||A homegrown candidate vaccine developed by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech has generated “robust” immune responses, including high levels of neutralising antibodies, against the novel coronavirus, government and industry researchers said on Wednesday. In their first scientific paper on human clinical trials of their candidate vaccine, the researchers have also described observing possible hints of immune memory responses critical for long-term efficacy triggered by all three formulations they tested. These early results do not permit assessment of the vaccine’s efficacy in protecting people from the coronavirus infection but had guided India’s drug regulatory agency’s decision to approve the efficacy trials that started last month and seek to enrol around 26,000 volunteers. In the safety and immunogenicity study, 375 volunteers were divided into four groups — 100 each in three groups who received different formulations of the candidate vaccine, and 75 in a placebo group who received dummy jabs. The researchers observed antibody responses in 83 per cent, 88 per cent and 92 per cent of volunteers who had received two doses of the vaccine. Six per cent of those on placebo too developed antibodies likely because they picked up natural infections during the trial. The study also detected neutralising antibodies that block the virus in significant proportions of the volunteers, the 24-member research team from Bharat Biotech, the Indian Council of Medical Research and hospitals that participated in the clinical trials said. “The vaccine was well-tolerated in all the dose groups with no vaccine-related serious adverse events,” the researchers said in their paper posted on an online archive for preprints but not peer-reviewed yet. One volunteer developed coronavirus disease but, the researchers said, the event was analysed and determined as “not causally associated with the vaccine”. Bharat Biotech is among three vaccine makers that have applied to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), the regulatory agency, for emergency use authorisation of their candidate vaccines. The Serum Institute of India, which is manufacturing the AstraZeneca vaccine in India, and the US-based Pfizer have also applied for emergency use authorisation. While Bharat Biotech is currently conducting its efficacy trials at multiple sites across India, the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines have been shown as effective in clinical trials in other countries. A CDSCO panel reviewing the applications had last week asked the Serum Institute to update its immunogenicity data from India and the UK and submit the outcome of AstraZeneca’s application for similar approval with the UK regulatory authority. The panel asked Bharat Biotech to submit safety and efficacy data from its ongoing clinical trial. Medical experts believe the CDSCO panel is likely to wait for regulatory approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK, the vaccine’s home country, before granting an approval in India. Bharat Biotech has a current capacity to produce 150 million doses per year but could increase the capacity to 500 million doses if required. The Serum Institute has a current capacity of 70 million doses per month, of which it can make available half for use within India.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-484
17-12-2020||India||Congress highlights Modi response to China on Vijay Diwas||The Congress on Wednesday used Vijay Diwas — the day Pakistan was defeated by India in the 1971 war — to question the BJP’s claim of monopoly over nationalism and the perception about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s robust leadership. The party’s top leadership ran a carefully crafted campaign on social media to send out a message that nationalism and patriotism can’t rest on narrow partisan politics and the leadership’s strength should be judged on facts instead of hollow rhetoric. They compared Indira Gandhi’s decisive response to the crisis in 1971 despite firm American intervention in favour of Pakistan with Modi’s handling of the Chinese intrusions, hoping that the younger generation would try to take a holistic perspective of what a robust leadership is all about. The Modi government also launched year-long celebrations with the 50th year of Vijay Diwas beginning on Wednesday. Although Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra threw only subtle hints about the difference in the attitudes of the two leaders — Indira and Modi — other leaders explicitly dwelt on the subject, apart from hundreds of analytical messages posted by the Congress on its Twitter handle. Rahul tweeted: “I bow to the valour of the Indian Army and congratulate the countrymen on the historic victory of India over Pakistan in 1971. This is a story of that time when India’s neighbours acknowledged the strength of India’s Prime Minister and feared violating our borders.” Congress veteran and former finance minister P. Chidambaram, however, spoke freely, saying: “India acted as a responsible power to protect peace in South Asia. That was true nationalism. There were no exaggerated claims, no boast. We have to compare the way this (1971) war was conducted then and the battle cries raised today. Today, India is not even willing to name the country which has encroached into our territory.” Chidambaram added: “Everyday, China strengthens its position on the borders and (we hear) only claims that India is matching in strength. No one is sure, there is no transparency, no information. It is a good time to look back 49 years ago to recall how a truly patriotic war effort must be conducted by leaders of this country. Let’s spare a moment to remember those brave soldiers, especially those who laid down their lives or were injured.” Modi not only took personal credit for the Balakot surgical strike, a much smaller event in comparison, by using such expressions like “Modi ne mara”, but also hijacked the entire 2019 parliamentary election using that triumphant war rhetoric. Congress leaders on Wednesday didn’t refer to the Balakot strike, the outcome of which is still not clear, and focused on the Chinese intrusions instead. Senior leader Pramod Tewari said: “China is threatening us, encroaching upon our land. Our brave soldiers would have taught them a lesson had there been a strong leader like Indira Gandhi.” At the Congress’s official briefing also, spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said: “While we owe it to our brave soldiers, the strong and decisive leadership of Indira Gandhi is needed to ensure that enemies are scared of India and actions are taken in national interest without fear, despite interventions by big global powers. China has today occupied our land and we are in denial. If today’s leadership demonstrates even a fraction of the courage shown by Indira Gandhi, our soldiers can teach the encroachers a lesson.” Many other leaders like Mallikarjun Kharge, Shashi Tharoor and Salman Khurshid posted videos to talk about the great victory that gave birth to a new nation — Bangladesh — and argued that previous leaders didn’t use the valour of soldiers for personal publicity and electoral campaigns. The party also used the occasion to deal with jingoistic nationalism, trying to give a correct perspective of history and meaning of patriotism in a democracy. A message posted by the Congress said: “Patriotism is nothing if not an unconditional devotion towards our fellow beings. Isn’t prioritising the needs of the people the purpose of democracy? Isn’t ensuring their safety, security and prosperity the meaning of true nationalism? Isn’t serving fellow citizens with true devotion and dedication an essential quality of real patriots?”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-484
17-12-2020||India||JEE'21 to be held in 13 languages, including English, Hindi and Bengali||The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main will be held in 13 languages, including English, Hindi and Bengali, in 2021 and students will get four chances to take the test. The scores will be used to decide admission to BTech courses in most national-level institutions. According to an information bulletin issued by the National Testing Agency (NTA) on Wednesday, the question papers will be available in English, Hindi, Urdu, Assamese, Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Odia, Punjabi, Gujarati, Tamil and Telugu. In 2020, the test was conducted in English, Hindi and Gujarati. The language options have been added in sync with the government’s proposed policy to start BTech courses in local languages at IITs and NITs. The government has proposed to create similar language options for JEE Advanced, the test conducted by IITs for selecting students for their BTech courses. The top 2.5 lakh scorers of JEE Main are eligible to appear for JEE Advanced. In JEE Main 2021, the regional language option will be available for students taking the test in the respective state where the language is spoken. Students will be able to take the test in English, Hindi or Urdu at any centre across the country. JEE Main has two papers — the first is meant for students seeking admission into BTech courses while the second is for those who want to pursue BArchitecture or BPlanning. The NTA, which has been conducted JEE Main since 2019, had been holding the test twice a year. In 2021, Paper 1 (BTech) of JEE Main will be held four times — in February, March, April and May. Students will have the option to appear all four times and the best score will be considered for ranking. Paper 2 (BArchitecture or Bplanning) will continue to be held twice a year, in February and May. The question papers will have two sections, 20 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and 10 questions whose answers are to be filled in as a numerical value. Among the 10 questions, the students will have to answer five questions. The 20 MCQs are compulsory.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-484
17-12-2020||India||Protesting farmers firm on call for repealing new farm laws||The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee on Wednesday said any panel such as the one the Supreme Court planned to set up to resolve the farmers’ agitation would be useful only after the three new farm laws were withdrawn. The apex court had earlier in the day set in motion efforts to form the committee, issuing notices to the Centre and eight farmers’ organisations. But having decided at the outset against moving court for repeal of the farm laws, the protesting unions appeared wary of the proposal. However, the farmers lauded the court’s remarks on the government’s handling of the agitation as a “moral victory”. “Your talks will again fail…. It seems the government may not be able to work out a solution,” Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde had told solicitor-general Tushar Mehta, who was appearing for the Centre. “SC-advised committee will be useful only after withdrawal of the acts. SC advice to government is a moral victory for farmers,” said a statement from the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), which had given the Dilli Chalo call that led to the farmers’ siege of Delhi’s borders. According to the All India Kisan Sabha, an AIKSCC constituent, the government had itself suggested such a panel during the December 1 talks with the farmers, who had unanimously rejected it saying nothing less than repeal of the three laws was acceptable. Yogendra Yadav of the Jai Kisan Andolan, another AIKSCC member, tweeted: “The SC can and must decide on the constitutionality of the 3 farm acts. But it is not for the judiciary to decide on the feasibility and desirability of these laws. That’s between the farmers and their elected leaders. SC monitored negotiation would be a wrong path.” Earlier in the morning, the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) — the platform under which the protests are going on — had sent a written response to the Centre on the amendments the government had proposed to the contentious laws last week. The letter to agriculture secretary Vivek Agrawal came after ministers began making a meal of the farmer organisations’ failure to respond to the offer in writing. In the letter, Darshan Pal of the SKM said: “We had rejected your offer received on December 9 because it was just a written version of what had been offered by you and rejected by the farmer organisations during the meeting of December 5. “Since we had already made our position clear, we did not give a written response. We also wish that you stop vilifying the farmers’ protest and holding parallel discussions with other farmer organisations.” The “other farmer organisations” referred to in the letter are those that agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar has been meeting regularly over the past few days to show there is support for the three laws. The farmers’ organisations have decided to set up a social media platform of their own to counter the narrative being pushed by the BJP’s famed “IT cell” and the fake news and propaganda being peddled against the agitation. Also, with the media attention waning, the farmers felt a need for a platform where they could post information to mobilise opinion and mount pressure on the government — much in the “atmanirbhar” (self-reliant) spirit the Narendra Modi government has been plugging. The siege of the Singhu border witnessed a suicide on Wednesday. Baba Ram Singh, 65, regarded as a “sant”, is said to have shot himself in the evening and been declared dead on arrival at a hospital. He was from Karnal in Haryana. Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Sirsa of the Shiromani Akali Dal said Ram Singh was a saint who had dedicated his life to public service. “He said in his suicide note that he cannot see the pain of farmers sitting on the roads,” Sirsa said in a video message.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-484
17-12-2020||India||Kerala’s ruling Left beats Congress, BJP and smear campaign||Kerala’s ruling Left on Wednesday dominated the local body polls months before the Assembly elections, basing its campaign on its performance in the face of an Opposition smear campaign that rode on financial controversies involving people close to senior Marxist leaders. The Left Democratic Front retained the Kozhikode, Kollam, Thrissur and Thiruvananthapuram corporations and wrested the coveted Kochi corporation from the Congress-led United Democratic Front, which retained Kannur alone among the six larger civic bodies. In an election fought with a verve more typical of Assembly and Lok Sabha polls, the Left won significant victories in both rural and urban constituencies, upsetting the Congress in many strongholds. In Thiruvananthapuram, the Left win spoiled an upbeat BJP’s dream of getting its own mayor to receive Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he comes campaigning ahead of next summer’s Assembly polls. Overall, the BJP marginally improved its performance — with the 2018 Sabarimala agitation appearing to pay off — but its avowed hopes of emerging as a force in Kerala were dashed. State BJP president K. Surendran had on Saturday predicted his party would win at least 61 of the Thiruvananthapuram corporation’s 100 seats. But the BJP ended up with 34 against the Left’s 51, while the UDF mustered just 10. For the Left, the icing on the cake were the convincing wins in central districts such as Kottayam and Idukki, where new ally Kerala Congress (Mani) helped it dislodge the UDF. For the first time in 25 years, the LDF won the Puthupally municipality, considered the pocket borough of Congress veteran Oommen Chandy; Ward 14 at Thriperunthura in Alappuzha, turf of leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala; and Ward 11 at Azhiyur village panchayat in Kozhikode, home to Congress president Mullapally Ramachandran. By 9pm, the Left had won or led in 514 of the 941 village panchayats, 108 of the 152 block panchayats, 10 of the 14 district panchayats, 35 of the 86 municipalities and 5 of the 6 city corporations. In 2015, the Left had won 549 village panchayats, 90 block panchayats, 7 district panchayats, 44 municipalities and 4 corporations. The UDF made some gains, winning or leading in 375 village panchayats (up from 365 last time) and 45 municipalities (up from 41), but lost ground in the block panchayats with 44 (down from 61), district panchayats with 4 (down from 7), and corporations with 1 (down from 2). The NDA’s massive campaign brought it 23 village panchayats (up from 13) and 2 municipalities (up from 1). Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the victory reflected the people’s approval of the state government’s responses to natural disasters like floods, landslides, the Nipah outbreak and the Covid-19 pandemic. He hailed the “people’s response to the Opposition campaign to destroy the state and its welfare projects”. “The Opposition, including the Right wing, and the central investigating agencies had come together with that specific aim,” Vijayan told a news conference. Among the controversies the UDF and NDA campaigns had flagged was a gold-smuggling case in which a senior CMO official was arrested, a bribery scandal involving a housing scheme for the flood-hit, and the arrest of the son of the then CPM state secretary in a money-laundering case linked to a drug bust in Bangalore. While the Left government had won widespread praise for its initial handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, a spurt in cases after the Onam festival had allowed the Opposition to accuse it of lowering its guard. Vijayan cited the “coming together of UDF and communal forces” as one reason for the Congress-led alliance’s defeat. The UDF had an electoral understanding with the Welfare Party of India, political arm of the Jamaat-e-Islami. The Left had also accused its rival coalition of aligning with the BJP to target the government. Ramachandran, the state Congress president, put up a brave face and lauded the party’s “good show” in some places. Chennithala claimed the party’s “foundation” was intact and played down the importance of local body polls. “The LDF has won all but one (2010) local body elections, but we have gone on to win the Assembly polls in the past,” he said. The BJP retained the Palakkad municipality, where it always wielded influence, and wrested the Pandalam municipality from the LDF. Pandalam was the launch pad of the BJP’s 2018 agitation against the state government decision to implement a Supreme Court verdict that lifted an age bar on women at the Sabarimala temple. The BJP won from 18 of Pandalam’s 33 wards, up from 7 wards in 2015. But the Thiruvananthapuram defeat seemed to rankle with state BJP chief Surendran, who blamed “the unholy alliance” between the UDF and the Left.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-485
17-12-2020||India||Nitish Kumar announces slew of sops, including free Covid vaccine||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has announced a slew of sops, including free coronavirus vaccine and 20 lakh jobs for the people, in what is being seen as an effort to counter the disquiet and opposition against him. The sops also have a distinct influence of Janata Dal United ally BJP. A cow species development institute would be also established in the state to conserve the indigenous cow species, a database of migrant workers would be prepared at the panchayat level, and efforts would be made in cooperation with the central government to set a “minimum support price (MSP)” for pulses. The decisions were taken at the first cabinet meeting of the new National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in the state chaired by Nitish on Tuesday evening after the allocation of departments to the ministers last month. “Free vaccination will be carried out in the entire state to protect the people from corona after its vaccine becomes available,” said Sanjay Kumar, principal secretary, cabinet secretariat department. Free coronavirus vaccine was the poll promise of the BJP and was one of the main points in its manifesto for the Assembly elections held in October–November. However, the promise had run into rough weather when sources said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during a meeting on the Covid-19 situation in the country, circumvented a question by Nitish on who would bear the cost of the vaccine. Modi is said to have asked to let the vaccine come first. The cost of providing free Covid-19 vaccine in Bihar, which has a population of around 11 crore, will run into thousands of crores of rupees. There is still not a word about who would bear the expenditure, though the decision has been bracketed under the state health department. “Now that free vaccine is a cabinet decision, it indicates that the state government will bear its cost. Financially, it is going to be an unnerving situation because Bihar is a low revenue state dependent mostly on the taxes shared by the Centre. The state coffers are virtually empty since the pandemic unfolded,” a senior state government official told The Telegraph. It is also unclear whether the entire population of Bihar would be vaccinated or some targeted sections would be given the vaccine doses. Central government officials have already made it clear that it has never said about vaccinating the entire population of the country and the decision would be taken on the basis of scientific analysis. The cabinet decision to create “more than 20 lakh employment opportunities in government and non-government sectors” is again a step towards the fulfilment of the NDA poll promise made to counter leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s promise of 10 lakh government jobs in the first cabinet meeting if he came to power. However, the state government has not set any deadline for the jobs or the manner they would be created. They form a part of Nitish’s “seven resolves for a developed Bihar — 2” that would be completed by the next Assembly elections in 2025. The first part of the “seven resolves” had the timeframe of 2015 to 2020. The fresh set of seven resolves include empowerment of the youth, women empowerment, irrigation for every farm, clean and developed villages, clean and developed cities, easy connectivity, and additional health facilities for all, including animal health. Meanwhile, the RJD said the state government’s decision to provide 20 lakh jobs was just a “jumla” (rhetoric) in the light of Tejashwi’s promise. It also alleged that the decision would end up like the earlier employment schemes brought by the state government. Tejashwi attacked the Nitish-led government on the completion of its first month without any concrete achievement. He gave the government a month’s time to take effective steps. “We are giving a month to this new government, which has come to power through hustle, to fulfil the demands of crores of unemployed, students and farmers; control the corruption spread in every nook and corner of the state and take solid steps to curb crime,” Tejashwi tweeted on Wednesday. RJD sources said that the party is considering launching a statewide agitation to press the government to implement its election promises.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-485

According to sources, the report claims the girl was raped before being killed. Stains of semen were found on her clothes during scientific examination, it said. Sources said the report confirmed the involvement of residents of the girl’s native village, in the crime. Former director-general of police Sanjeev Marik said, “The report indicates that the accused had a vengeful mindset. The SIT will certainly go for DNA matching of villagers.” The SIT has also identified the accused, according to sources, raising question marks over the efficiency and impartiality of local police. The SIT was constituted by the state government following allegations that higher education minister Arun Sahoo is shielding those involved in the crime. On July 14, the five-year-old was allegedly kidnapped while playing near her house. A fortnight later her body was found in a decomposed state from the backyard of the house. Her parents alleged that since those involved in the crime were close to Sahoo, the police were not taking action in the matter. As the local police failed to initiate any action, her parents attempted suicide by setting themselves ablaze in front of the Assembly on November 24. The state BJP on Wednesday announced a padayatra from December 20 from Lingaraj temple in Bhubaneswar to Jadupur, 120km away, to demand justice for the girl. State BJP president Samir Mohanty said: “In the last two years, 5,503 children have gone missing in Odisha. This is unfortunate and alarming. We will fight till girl’s family gets justice.” “The state government has failed to provide security to women and girls. Nearly 5,000 children have gone missing in the last two years but the police have failed to arrest the accused involved in such heinous crimes,” said state BJP women’s wing chief Smruti Patnaik. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights is also inquiring into the issue.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-485

Owaisi and Om Prakash Rajbhar, the leader of the Suheldeo Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) who was a minister in the Yogi Adityanath government but is now a trenchant critic of the BJP, met in Lucknow on Wednesday and later announced the alliance. “It was clearly a political meeting with the hope of making some difference in Uttar Pradesh in the next elections. We and many other smaller parties are going to contest against the BJP together,” Rajbhar told reporters. The SBSP has four MLAs in the 403-member House. “We are excited after our successful entry in the Bihar elections and are trying to spread our base in Uttar Pradesh too. An alliance of smaller parties would leave a positive impact on the people-centric politics of the heartland,” said Owaisi, whose party won five seats in Bihar. The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) does not have any MLAs in Uttar Pradesh. Later, Owaisi also met Shivpal Yadav, who has formed the Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia) after being thrown out of the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party. Shivpal is the only MLA of his party. Rajbhar, an OBC leader, wields influence in over 25 Assembly seats in east Uttar Pradesh. Shivpal doesn’t have any substantial hold outside Jaswantnagar, which he represents in the Assembly. Owaisi can hope to eat into the Samajwadi Party’s Muslim vote base in over 50 seats of west Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-485

The Congress leader had intervened to question wastage of time on debating issues such as uniforms instead of critical concerns but was shouted down by the BJP members. As the chairman of the committee, BJP leader Jual Oram, did not allow Rahul to speak on other issues, he and other Congress members walked out. The meeting, after discussing uniforms for one-and-a-half hours, ended abruptly. The trouble started when BJP MP Devender Paul Vats raised the issue of changes in uniform, calling for uniformity and parity in the rank and names of all the wings — the army, navy and the air force — so there is no confusion. This was mentioned when officers, led by Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, were making a presentation on how military service branches in the US and other countries had uniforms that made it easy to distinguish between various ranks. Rahul intervened to ask why politicians had to decide on uniforms and ranks as these should best be left to the armed forces themselves. The chairman of the committee asked them not to speak on subjects not being discussed. But Rahul insisted that General Rawat clarify whether the armed forces were not competent to decide these matters on their own. Sources said the Congress members were not allowed to speak, leading to the walkout.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-485

Maheshwari||The Supreme Court collegium has recommended to the Centre the transfer of Andhra Pradesh High Court Chief Justice J.K. Maheshwari, days after chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy complained to the Chief Justice of India about the state’s top judiciary. Justice Maheshwari has been recommended for transfer to Sikkim High Court as its chief justice. The Andhra Pradesh chief minister had on October 6 taken the unprecedented step of writing to Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde alleging that the state high court was being used to “destabilise and topple” his democratically elected government. In the same letter, Jagan had alleged that Supreme Court judge Justice N.V. Ramana, the next in line to be the Chief Justice of India, had favoured the chief minister’s political rival and Telugu Desam Party leader N. Chandrababu Naidu and the judge’s daughters had purchased land under questionable circumstances in Amravati before the site was chosen for the new Andhra capital. The same day, October 6, Jagan had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss Andhra affairs. Apart from CJI Bobde, Justices Ramana, R.F. Nariman, U.U. Lalit and A.M. Khanwilkar are part of the five-judge collegium. The collegium headed by CJI Bobde, in its meeting held on December 14, also recommended the elevation of five high court judges as chief justices of different high courts. Justice Dr S. Muralidhar, a notification transferring whom to Punjab and Haryana High Court close to midnight of February 26 had created a controversy, is among those promoted. Justice Muralidhar has been recommended to be elevated as chief justice of Orissa High Court.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-485
