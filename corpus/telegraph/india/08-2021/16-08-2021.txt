These made-to-order brands with active Instagram presence are helping you with designs, fabric options and styling ideas –– all you have to do is send them your measurements when something you like ‘drops’ for sale. In most cases, the faces behind these small businesses are the kindest people one can hope to work with and the relationship between the shopper and seller is based on a mutual sense of trust.

Born out of a dream by Pearl Academy student Gaurie, her final push came when she saw her very talented and experienced tailors worry about their business post-lockdown. “Danish bhai had encouraged me enough to start The Cowrie Collective and show these clothes to other people and see if they’d be interested in buying them. To my (very pleasant) surprise, they were! We sold our first piece within 20 minutes and the next one within 40. This motivated the three of us greatly and we started seeing this as something we could actually pull off (and enjoy),” said Gaurie.

16-08-2021||India||Farmers to mark 9 months of their agitation with national convention||Farmers protesting against the Centre's three contentious agri laws will organise a national convention on August 26 to mark the completion of nine months of their agitation, according to a statement from the Samyukt Kisan Morcha on Monday. "To mark the completion of nine months of historic, continuous peaceful protests by lakhs of farmers, Samyukt Kisan Morcha has decided to hold a national convention on August 26. This all-India convention will witness the participation of representatives of hundreds of farmers' organisations which have been part of the ongoing protests locally, regionally and nationally, the umbrella body of over 40 farm unions said. Details regarding the venue of the national convention will be worked out later, a farmer leader said. Thousands of farmers from across the country, particularly Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi borders, including Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, since November last year. The three laws that the farmers are demanding to be repealed, they claim, will do away with the Minimum Support Price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations. Over 10 rounds of talks with the government that has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties. Before their national convention on August 26, the farmers will also mark the completion of 36 years of the Narmada Bachao Ancholan, for which a 'Narmada Kisan Mazdoor Jan Sansad' is being organised in Badwani in Madhya Pradesh, the SKM said. On August 17, to mark the completion of 36 years of Narmada Bachao Andolan, 'Narmada Kisan Mazdoor Jan Sansad' will be organised in Badwani. Several SKM leaders are expected to take part in this event, which will see the participation of thousands of farmers from various places in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra in addition to villagers from numerous villages of Narmada valley, the body said. It added that to strengthen their agitation against the three contentious laws, farmers from southern India have been arriving at the protest sites on Delhi borders. More farmers from distant locations are joining the protest sites. Hundreds of farmers from Tamil Nadu reached the Singhu border yesterday. A contingent of farmers from Karnataka addressed the gathering at Ghazipur border today, the SKM said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-309
16-08-2021||India||Will provide 1.11cr jabs to Kerala to combat Covid: Health minister||Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, who arrived in Kerala with a central team on Monday to review the Covid-19 situation in the state, said the Centre has allocated Rs 267.35 crore to the state to strengthen its health infrastructure and will also provide it 1.11 crore vaccines in August and September. In a tweet, subsequent to his "intensive" meeting with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and state Health Minister Veena George, Mandaviya said that besides the Rs 267.35 crore an additional Rs one crore would be made available to each district of Kerala for creating a medicine pool. He also said that the central government has assured all possible help to Kerala, including providing vaccines to the state. "Had an intensive meeting with the Chief Minister and Health Minister of Kerala, @VijayanPinarayi ji & Veena George ji, along with State officials to review Covid-19 situation in Kerala." "Central Govt allocates Rs 267.35 crore to Kerala under Emergency Covid Response Package- II. It will strengthen the state's health infrastructure & effectively manage Covid-19. Additionally, Rs 1 crore will be made available to each district of Kerala for creating a medicine pool," he tweeted. Later the Kerala Public Relations Department (PRD) said that the Union Minister assured that the central government will take steps to provide 1.11 crore urgently needed vaccines to the state to combat Covid-19 as was requested by the CM. Mandaviya also tweeted that the "Central Govt will ensure creation of a Center of Excellence that caters to Telemedicine Facilities in every district in Kerala. For prioritising the health of children, paediatric ICU to be established in district hospitals with a 10 kilo-litre liquid oxygen storage tank facility." After the meeting with the Kerala CM and Health Minister, Mandaviya also met Governor Arif Mohammed Khan. "Paid a courtesy call on the Hon'ble Governor of Kerala, Shri Arif Mohammed Khan. We had a discussion on the measures being taken by the Central Govt to support Kerala's fight against Covid-19," the Union Minister tweeted. He also tweeted that he toured the Hindustan Latex Ltd (HLL) unit in Thiruvananthapuram, reviewed its operations and also took stock of the quality of medical products being manufactured there and also visited the Covid facility at the Government Medical College in the state capital. Giving details of the meeting between the central team, the CM and state health minister, the PRD in a statement said that starting of a vaccine manufacturing unit at the Bio Park in Thiruvananthapuram was discussed and the Union Minister said such an establishment would be beneficial as both Covid and other vaccines can be produced there. During the meeting, the CM said that 56 per cent of the population was still unaffected by Covid and therefore, more people were likely to get infected in the coming days and in such a scenario the only way out was to vaccinate everyone, including one million guest workers, which is why more vaccines are needed, the PRD statement said. In the meeting, Mandaviya said the central government was trying to provide necessary assistance to all the state governments and his current visit was part of the same, the PRD said. According to the PRD, the Union Minister also said that through such visits the Centre gains knowledge of the measures taken by states to defend against Covid-19 and the experiences of the central government can be shared with them He further said that in August, 18 crore vaccines were produced with 20 crore more to be manufactured in September and Kerala will get the number of doses it deserves and any additional demands would be considered sympathetically. Earlier in the day, the PRD said that Mandaviya lauded the coronavirus prevention steps taken by the state government. He also termed the healthcare system here as "excellent" and assured availability of more vaccines for Kerala, and praised the lack of vaccine wastage by the state by saying that it has set an example with regard to administration of doses, the PRD said. Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan also said that Kerala was ahead of the national average in vaccination and the death rate here was low, it said. He also said that more attention should be paid during Onam and that those who are in home quarantine should be monitored separately. Mandaviya and the central team visited Kerala at a time when it was accounting for more than half of the nation's daily fresh infection caseload. Kerala on Sunday reported 18,582 new Covid-19 cases, which was more than half of the national total of 32,937 fresh coronavirus cases. On Sunday, the Test Positivity Rate was 15.11 per cent in the state.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-309
16-08-2021||India||Meet Pawan Monga, Delhi BJP’s Member who is gaining recognition for his exceptional work during Pandemic||With Covid pandemic hitting the world, a lot around us has changed. The world is in chaos and the same applies to India. There was a kind of an undeclared emergency with the government being left with no option apart from imposing a lockdown. The lockdown further led to job losses, manufacturing units being shut down and laborers forced to flee their workplaces and migrating to their hometowns. The pandemic was also a test for the healthcare system of the Nation which eventually collapsed in the second wave that hit the country in Mid 2020. There was a scarcity of beds and oxygen supply in the hospitals across the country. Things were onto a next level in the National Capital with people unable to get medical facilities for their loved ones. There was total chaos as people were left to die. A lot of individuals, well known personalities, members of civil societies and NGOs came forward to do their bit in helping people. One such individual is Pawan Monga, who happens to be the Executive Member of BJP’s Delhi unit, has done a tremendous job during these difficult times. Pawan who is also the President of ‘Ekta Mission’, with his team of selfless, hard-working people did a commendable job during the second wave. Pawan was seen on the ground working tirelessly day and night. He made sure that people across Delhi don't suffer from lack of food and medical facilities. He helped people in arranging them with Plasma, Injections, Oxygen Cylinders and the life saving drug- Remdisivir. ‘Ekta Mission’ is the platform which he utilised in doing this noble work. They have been credited to run successful campaigns making people aware of the importance of wearing a mask and using the sanitizers. Ekta Mission also helped lakhs of underprivileged, poor people by distributing them lakhs of masks and sanitizers free of cost. They further set up several camps and covid booths across the city providing people with relief items. Pawan has been leading from the front in the Nation’s fight against the Covid. He is the man who made other political leaders across the political spectrum hit the ground, saving the lives of thousands of people. Pawan also inspired his own leaders in the BJP to come forward and get united in these miserable times. Seeing his commitment, a lot of young people volunteered in Ekta Mission’s program and together they have been successful in providing food and medical facilities in the remotest parts of the City. Pawan with his initiative made sure that there’s no deaths due to the lack of beds and oxygen cylinders in Delhi and keeping this in mind, they have been successful in arranging oxygen cylinders, hospitals beds, ICU wards and medicines. Apart from this, Ekta Mission has set up several blood plasma donation camps across the city for those people who have defeated and recovered from the deadly virus. For migrant laborers, they have worked towards providing them with food and medical care during these tough times. Commenting on his campaign and the love it received from the common public, Pawan said “I am delighted to have been able to serve the people by providing them with the essentials. ‘Ekta Mission’ has been successful in arranging beds and oxygen cylinders for lakhs of people and this gives me immense satisfaction.” “Our party, BJP was on the ground 24*7 working for the people and I am happy to be a member of such a political party.” Pawan and his Ekta Mission deserves all sorts of appreciation for the immense work they have done during the Covid times.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-309

16-08-2021||India||India promises to help stranded Afghan Sikhs and Hindus to return||In its first reaction to the unfolding developments in Afghanistan, India on Monday said it is constantly monitoring the situation and will take all steps to ensure the safety and security of Indian nationals as well as its interests in that country. External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India is also in touch with representatives of the Afghan Sikh and Hindu communities in Afghanistan and will facilitate the repatriation of those who wish to leave that country. "The situation in Afghanistan is being monitored on a constant basis at high levels. The government will take all steps to ensure the safety and security of Indian nationals and our interests in Afghanistan," Bagchi said. Capping its month-long rapid advances, the Taliban took positions in Kabul on Sunday evening hours after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani left for an unknown destination, paving the way the takeover of the capital as well as the country. "The security situation in Kabul has deteriorated significantly in the last few days. It is changing rapidly even as we speak," Bagchi said. He said there are a number of Afghans who have been India's partners in the promotion of mutual developmental, educational and people-to-people endeavours and India will stand by them. "We have been issuing periodic advisories for the safety and security of Indian nationals in that country, including calling for their immediate return to India," he said. "We had circulated emergency contact numbers and had also been extending assistance to community members. We are aware that there are still some Indian nationals in Afghanistan who wish to return and we are in touch with them," Bagchi added. 5 killed at Kabul airport Amid a thoroughly chaotic day in Afghanistan where 5 people lost their lives while trying to flee the country, over 200 Indians are reportedly stuck in the country's capital Kabul. The contingent, including Foreign Ministry staff and paramilitary soldiers tasked for their protection, are yet to be evacuated from the city, NDTV quoted sources as saying. An Indian aircraft is parked at the chaotic Kabul airport, sources said, adding the big concern is how to safely bring the staff from the Indian mission compound to the airport. The Taliban has enforced a curfew in the city, they said. The Indians stranded in Kabul include some 100 personnel of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police or ITBP, tasked with protecting the Indian mission in Afghanistan. Air space closed The Afghan airspace has been closed to commercial flights after thousands of desperate people overran the tarmac this morning in the hope of getting out of the war-torn country, a day after the Taliban took control of the city. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has already left the country. Why the delay? Questions are being raised on why the Indian mission staff were not evacuated in the last three-four days when the situation on the ground was changing fast, sources have said. The missions of other nations in the war-torn country had been thinning out when Taliban started taking city after city before encircling Kabul and entering the city on Sunday. With Afghanistan's airspace closed, Air India flights coming from the US are likely to be re-routed, they said. The Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority asked all transit aircraft to reroute, adding any transit through Kabul airspace would be uncontrolled, news agency Reuters reported. Kabul's flight information region covers all of Afghanistan.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-309
16-08-2021||India||Supreme Court extends deadline to frame guidelines for compensation to Covid victims' kin ||The Supreme Court on Monday granted 4-week extension to the Centre to frame guidelines for ex-gratia compensation to families of those who died of Covid-19. The Centre told the top court that the exercise of framing the guidelines is at an advanced stage and therefore some more time is required for in-depth examination before it is finalised and implemented. During the brief hearing, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah asked Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati about compliance of other directions given by the court in its verdict on June 30. Bhati told the bench that she will file an affidavit within two weeks giving the entire details of compliance of other directions issued by the court. The bench then ordered that time be extended by four weeks for compliance of the direction on framing of the guidelines. It directed the Centre to file a status report on compliance of other directions of the court and listed the matter for further hearing after two weeks. The apex court had in its June 30 verdict directed NDMA to recommend within six weeks appropriate guidelines for ex-gratia assistance on account of loss of life to the family members of persons who died due to Covid-19. The Centre has moved an application seeking some more time to frame the guidelines on the ground that the exercise which was in active consideration of the NDMA was at an advanced stage and requires a little more in-depth examination. In its June 30 verdict, the top court had also ordered steps to simplify guidelines for issuance and correction of death certificates/official documents, stating the exact cause of death, that is, 'Death due to Covid-19' for enabling dependents to get benefits of welfare schemes. The top court's verdict had come on two separate pleas filed by lawyers Reepak Kansal and Gaurav Kumar Bansal seeking directions to the Centre and the states to provide Rs 4 lakh compensation to the families of coronavirus victims as provisioned under the Act. Four intervenors, who had lost their family members due to Covid have also moved the top court through advocate Sumeer Sodhi contending that there cannot be any discrimination in the amounts being paid by different states to family members of those, who had succumbed to the deadly infection. The apex court in its verdict, however, had noted the peculiarity and the impact and effect of the pandemic and said that it cannot order payment of Rs 4 lakh as ex-gratia compensation which should be decided by the NDMA as there was a need to focus simultaneously on prevention, preparedness, mitigation and recovery, which calls for a different order of mobilization of both financial and technical resources . We direct the NDMA to recommend guidelines for ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life to the family members of the persons who died due to Covid-19, as mandated under Section 12(iii) of Disaster Management Act (DMA) 2005 for the minimum standards of relief to be provided to the persons affected by disaster - Covid 19 Pandemic, over and above the guidelines already recommended for the minimum standards of relief to be provided to persons affected by Covid-19, it had said. It had also directed the Centre to take appropriate steps on recommendations of the Finance Commission on providing insurance cover for deaths caused by Covid. The direction had come after the Centre said that presently there was no guideline/policy/scheme in NDMA which relates to National Insurance mechanism that may be used to pay for disaster related deaths due to Covid .||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-309
16-08-2021||India||Everyone has failed us, says Afghan Intelligent official ||“I had to run, else the Taliban would have killed me. Everything ends here. I could not bring my family along,” Afghan intelligence officer Asif said in broken Hindi as tears welled up in his eyes, hours after he landed in Delhi. The 41-year-old officer took the last commercial flight from Kabul to Delhi on Sunday to escape "certain death", leaving behind his ailing mother, wife and an eight-year-old son. A compatriot helped Asif find a modest accommodation -- a small room, attached bathroom and a marble slab with a sink that he called kitchen -- in Lajpat Nagar for Rs 500 a day. "I will try if I can get a room for Rs 200-300, said the officer, who wanted to be identified as just Asif. Asked if he had food, the officer of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), the national intelligence and security service of Afghanistan, burst into tears. His hands trembled and lips quivered as he took out his passport, an NDS identity card and photographs of his family from his bag. "The Taliban are catching us, killing us. They sent us notices, asking us to revolt against the government or die. We lost hope after (President Ashraf) Ghani fled (the country). Hundreds of officers from the security establishment have fled to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and other countries, he said, as beads of sweat trickled down from his forehead. Asked if his family is safe back home, Asif said he had no information as Internet services have been hit in some areas in Kabul, which fell to the Taliban on Sunday. "I got my visa a month before. Ten days ago, we had intel that the Taliban is going to return, he said. “Pakistan betrayed us.... I served my nation for 20 years. This was my life,” Asif said before he broke down again, holding some of his pictures in NDS uniform and the security badge. He told PTI he and his colleagues shed their uniform and changed into civilian clothes before boarding a flight to India last night. Air India -- the only airline that has been operating flights between India and Afghanistan -- operated its last Delhi-Kabul-Delhi flight on Sunday. The flight scheduled for Monday has been cancelled. Asif says women have ditched salwar-kameez for burqas and have been keeping indoors. They will be killed if they don't, he said. "Sab khatam (everything is over)... There is no chance we will return to our country ever. Our beloved home is lost. I don't even know if my family will be able to make it to India, Asif said. Afghanistan stares at an uncertain future as President Ashraf Ghani left the country just before Kabul fell into the hands of the Taliban on Sunday. Sitting in his chemist shop barely a hundred metres away, Yousuf Yousufi, who fled Afghanistan five years ago, is hooked to his mobile screen, watching videos of crowds at the Kabul airport and Taliban fighters storming presidential palace. Some of the videos that a friend in Kabul sent to him purportedly showed people jostling with one another to get into a plane at the Kabul airport. The burst of machine gun could be heard in another video shot at night, as people ran down the streets. Taliban forced many policemen leave our motherland over the years. Else, they would have killed us some day, the 35-year-old father of three children said. "My mother, sister and brother are stuck there. They have locked themselves inside our home in Kabul. I have not been able to talk to them. The Internet isn't working there, he said. Yousufi's eyes are swollen and red. He says he hasn't slept well for three days. He says he's stressed and takes a puff of a cigarette before suddenly breaking down, seeing a video which showed a child crying over the body of a woman. “You asked me why I left my family there. I am an Afghan policeman. These children (the ones in the video) are my family. Our leaders abandoned us,” he said. “Everyone has failed us. The United States ditched us.... We will be forever indebted if the Indian government help us evacuate our family,” Yousufi said. In the adjoining four-storeyed building, Shukriya, 47, recalled the time when she ran a beauty parlour in Kabul. “My parents sold me to a mujahideen' for Rs 4 lakh. He had two more wives. He would not let me go to the market without a burqa and beat me up if I talked to a man,” she recalled. The government helped Shukriya get a divorce and she fled to India with a daughter and a son. “The Taliban are cruel to women. They won't let girls go to school, they abduct and forcibly marry teenagers and stone them to death if they fall in love,” she said. Shukriya felt Afghanistan has lost his chance to become a modern, democratic state with the relentless advance of the Taliban.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-309
16-08-2021||India||Can’t compel reluctant Centre to file detailed affidavit on Pegasus, says SC ||The Supreme Court Monday said it cannot compel the reluctant Centre to file a detailed affidavit on pleas seeking information if Pegasus spyware was used to snoop on certain citizens and steps it took to probe the allegations amid vehement claims that there was nothing to hide and it will set up a panel to examine all aspects related to the issue. The apex court bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana would on Tuesday deliberate on whether the Centre should file a detailed affidavit in the matter, after the short one in which it submitted on Monday that the pleas were based on conjectures and surmises or on other unsubstantiated media reports or incomplete or uncorroborated material. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said the matter, if gone into on the basis of unsubstantiated reports, may have national security implications and it cannot be handled by asking furnish an affidavit etc. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology in a two-page affidavit told the bench, also comprising justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose, that to dispel any wrong narrative spread by certain vested interests and with an object of examining the issues raised, the Centre will constitute a Committee of Experts in the field which will go in to all aspects of the issue. You see, when the government is reluctant, then can you force it to file a detailed affidavit? the bench said, adding, “We will continue tomorrow... If Mr Mehta (Solicitor General) may decide to file an affidavit, then we have nothing to say, or we will hear all of you.” The law officer said, “The government is not reluctant at all... I ask myself a question if a one page affidavit is filed saying that Pegasus was not used then will they withdraw the petitions. The answer is no.” He said, “If it is for fact finding, then I am for it. But if it is for sensationalising which is alien to Article 32 then I cannot help it. It looks like petitioners want to go somewhere else other than what courts want to see.” Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for veteran journalists N Ram and Sashi Kumar who have filed one of the petitions in the matter, argued that the Centre should file an affidavit stating whether the government or its agencies have used Pegasus. The Solicitor General said, “Pegasus issue would involve the aspect of national security and the matter is sensitive.” We are dealing with a sensitive matter and the attempt seems to be to make it sensational, Mehta told the bench, adding, There would be an issue of national security . At the outset, Mehta told the bench that this issue is "highly technical" and expertise was needed to examine the aspects. "There is nothing to hide. It needs an examination by a committee of experts. This is a highly technical issue. We will appoint eminent neutral experts from the field," he said. Sibal said the Centre's affidavit does not say whether the government or its agencies had used the spyware. "We do not want the government, which might have used Pegasus or its agency might have used it, to set up a committee on its own," Sibal said. While contending that petitioners have relied upon news reports published by a web portal, Mehta said, “According to us, a false narrative is created.” The law officer referred to statement of minister in parliament and said the issues have been clarified and nothing further needed to be done in view of the fact that none of the petitioners have made out a case which has been raised after a web portal published a sensational story before parliament session. During the hearing, Justice Bose told parties about his one meeting with one of the petitioners in a social gathering and asked whether anybody has any objection if he continues hearing the pleas. All lawyers, in one voice, said no. “Only, I can have the objection. We don't have any objection... I have full faith,” said Mehta. Sibal raised many objections to the Centre's short affidavit and said the government should say on oath that it never used the spyware and if it has used the technology then we do not want the government which might have used pegasus to set up a committee. I am not concerned about the individuals. I am worried about the institutions which are the journalists and courts and both are the pillars of democracy, he said and again referred to alleged snooping of a woman employee and some officials of the apex court. He referred to rules and said the affidavit in the matters should be filed by Home Secretary instead of other officials. “If Interception is allowed legally then Home Secretary will know and if he says he does not know then it has been done without his knowledge,” he said, adding that countries like Israel and France have started a probe and Indian govt is saying that everything is fine. This is wholly unacceptable. Give them time but let them state on oath did they use Pegasus, how it was used, what deal contracts were entered into. Cabinet secretary should reply, he said. The court is hearing a batch of pleas, including the one filed by Editors Guild of India, seeking independent probe into the matter. They are related to reports of alleged snooping by government agencies on eminent citizens, politicians and scribes by using Israeli firm NSO's spyware Pegasus. An international media consortium has reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on the list of potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus spyware.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-309
16-08-2021||India||Pawar to Centre: Bring law to remove quota cap||Maintaining that the Constitution was bigger than any court judgement, NCP president Sharad Pawar on Monday asked the Centre to enact a law to remove the Supreme Court-mandated 50 per cent cap on reservations and allow states to exceed the existing quota limit. Pawar also said the use of force by mashals during ruckus in the Rajya Sabha last week was an "attack" on parliamentarians and democracy, and asserted that the Modi government fielding seven Union ministers before the media to justify its stand on the bedlam shows it was on a "weak wicket". Addressing a press conference here, Pawar said the Constitution was bigger than any judgement and asked the Modi government to bring a constitutional amendment to relax the 50 per cent cap on reservations in jobs and education and allow states to exceed existing quota limit.Articles 15(4) and 16(4) (dealing with provision for socially and educationally backward classes,and reservation) do not put any limit on the percentage of quota and there is no constitutional hurdle in increasing the same, the former Union minister said. The central government has already exceeded the 50 per cent limit by providing a 10 per cent quota in jobs and education for economically weaker sections, Pawar said. Pawar asked the Centre to undertake a caste-based census and claimed the Modi Central government misled people on the quota issue. The constitutional amendment of restoring the right of the states to prepare a list of OBCs, taken away two years ago, is a mere eyewash, he said. Unless the 50 per cent cap is relaxed, the Maratha quota cannot be restored. Similarly, the empirical data on OBCs should be shared with the states. Unless the data is available, it cannot be known how much representation needs to be given to smaller castes, the NCP leader said.Pawar said reservation in most of the states is above 60 per cent. Someone will have to show courage to speak in front of Modi. Deception is the only motive for the constitutional amendment," he said.On August 10, the Lok Sabha passed a bill allowing states to decide who their Other Backward Classes (OBCs) are. The 127th Constitution Amendment Act, 2021, restores the power of states to identify socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs), usually called OBCs.In May, the Supreme Court struck down the 2018 Maharashtra law granting quota to Marathas in admissions and government jobs, terming it as unconstitutional", and held there were no exceptional circumstances to breach the 50 per cent reservation cap set by the 1992 Mandal verdict. At the press meet, Pawar also spoke about the ruckus that erupted in the Upper House of Parliament last week and the opposition and the government trading charges over the unprecedented unruly scenes. The veteran politician (80) said in his 54 years of parliamentary life, he had never seen 40 marshals entering the House during a session. Pawar said the use of force by marshals in Parliament was dangerous for democracy. The fact that seven to eight ministers came together to justify the government action shows they were on a "weak wicket", the NCP leader said. Pawar said the opposition was only asking the government to discuss some key issues. "Never before in parliamentary democracy 40 marshals had entered the House and pushed the MPs. This was an attack on parliamentarians and we condemn it. The opposition members were demanding that the Centre make its stand on the Pegasus case clear, debate the farm laws and scrap them and discuss price rise. "We also demanded that the insurance bill be sent to a joint select committee but the government got it passed in a hurry. Opposition members protested against this act of the government ," he said. Pawar further said a probe was needed into the allegations that "outsiders" entered the House when it was in session. He also said any Congress leader from among Abhishek Manu Singhvi, P Chidambaram and Kapil Sibal should be part of a parliamentary committee on the Pegasus 'snooping' issue. Before the Rajya Sabha was adjourned sine die last Wednesday, it witnessed ugly scenes of Opposition members jostling with marshals as they tore papers, entered the Well of the Upper House and attempted to go near the presiding officer's chair. Referring to the din in the House, Pawar said, "We were told some bills are about constitutional amendment. The opposition said there is no mention about discussion on the Pegasus issue. Whatever happened, happened in front of me since my seat is in the front. Some members did go into the Well." With the Taliban taking over Afghanistan, Pawar underlined the need to review India's foreign policy concerning all the neighbouring countries. "We should be alert and will have to take precautions in the long run. There was a time when except Pakistan and China, our relations with other neighbours were good," the former defence minister said. Taliban insurgents swept into Afghanistan's capital Kabul on Sunday after the government collapsed and President Ashraf Ghani left the country. "It is time to review our foreign policy concerning other countries. The situation is not good. But it is a sensitive issue. We will cooperate with the government since this is about national security," the former defence minister said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-310
16-08-2021||India||Over 200 Indian still stuck in Kabul: Report||Amid a thoroughly chaotic day in Afghanistan where 5 people lost their lives while trying to flee the country, over 200 Indians are reportedly stuck in the country's capital Kabul. The contingent, including Foreign Ministry staff and paramilitary soldiers tasked for their protection, are yet to be evacuated from the city, NDTV quoted sources as saying. An Indian aircraft is parked at the chaotic Kabul airport, sources said, adding the big concern is how to safely bring the staff from the Indian mission compound to the airport. The Taliban has enforced a curfew in the city, they said. The Indians stranded in Kabul include some 100 personnel of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police or ITBP, tasked with protecting the Indian mission in Afghanistan. The Afghan airspace has been closed to commercial flights after thousands of desperate people overran the tarmac this morning in the hope of getting out of the war-torn country, a day after the Taliban took control of the city. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has already left the country. The Cabinet Secretary is meeting with Foreign Ministry officials to work out the evacuation plan, which is already in place, in detail, sources told NDTV. Questions are being raised on why the Indian mission staff were not evacuated in the last three-four days when the situation on the ground was changing fast, sources have said. The missions of other nations in the war-torn country had been thinning out when Taliban started taking city after city before encircling Kabul and entering the city on Sunday. With Afghanistan's airspace closed, Air India flights coming from the US are likely to be re-routed, they said. The Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority asked all transit aircraft to reroute, adding any transit through Kabul airspace would be uncontrolled, news agency Reuters reported. Kabul's flight information region covers all of Afghanistan. Five people were killed at Kabul airport today, but it's unclear whether they died in firing or stampede, Reuters reported. The Taliban took control of Afghanistan after President Ashraf Ghani fled the country and conceded the terrorists had won the 20-year war. The astonishingly quick collapse of the government, with terrorists taking over the presidential palace on Sunday night, was what triggered fear and panic in Kabul.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-310

16-08-2021||India||India’s democracy needs repairing, says Sonia Gandhi||As India enters the 75th year of independence, the Congress Monday said party chief Sonia Gandhi has urged people to introspect what freedom means and told them it is a "sin" to remain silent when fundamental rights and the Constitution are "trampled upon". She also said the country's democracy needs repairing. "When fundamental rights of people, guaranteed by the founding fathers of our Constitution are being trampled upon, it is a sin to stay silent," Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, quoting Gandhi's article in an English daily. He said that in the article, the party president has talked about what freedom means for people, with the country entering the 75th year of Independence. When the government "attacks" Parliament and "tramples upon" its traditions, "enslaves" democracy, attempts to "violate" the Constitution and "shackles" institutional autonomy, the people of the country need to introspect what freedom means to them, she has said. Gandhi has alleged that currently journalists do not have the freedom to write, TV channels the freedom to show the truth, and writers and thinkers the freedom to express themselves. She also alleged parliamentarians don't have the freedom to express their views, people affected by the oxygen shortage crisis and GST do not have the freedom to speak and the states, in a federal structure, do not have the freedom to demand their rights. In her article she argues that Indian democracy is in need of repair. "We must undo the damage." She said the progress achieved in the last few decades has been reversed under the present government which indulges in "hollow slogans, event management and brand-building" at the cost of governance. "After decades of progress towards an India of our dreams, why is our democracy in danger? It is because tangible achievements have been substituted by hollow slogans, event management and brand-building only to benefit those in power at the expense of governance. "It is because symbolism has triumphed over meaningful action. It is because democracy is sought to be replaced by an autocracy. Today's symbolism and reality is that Parliament House is being turned into a museum," Gandhi said in the article shared by the Congress. As we begin independent India's 75th year, we owe it to our freedom fighters to undo this damage to our Republic, the Congress president said. She also called on the need to draw courage from them to take on those who would replace their inclusive, liberating idealism with a narrow, sectarian, worldview overflowing with prejudice and discrimination. "We must not be swayed by hollow attempts to appropriate our icons by those who made no contribution to our struggle for independence. They may borrow Gandhiji's eyeglasses but their vision for our country remains Godse's. Our founders rejected that divisive ideology 74 years ago, and we must reject it once again," Gandhi said. She said in a world affected by the COVID-19 and climate change, India's response to these challenges will be crucial to the world. "The recently concluded Monsoon session of Parliament displayed the disdain of the present [Modi] government towards parliamentary processes and building consensus," Gandhi said. She claimed that the opposition was repeatedly denied an opportunity to raise issues of national importance. "Increasingly over the past 7 years, laws have been passed without debate in the House or scrutiny by a Committee, effectively turning Parliament into a rubber stamp," she alleged. She also alleged democratically-elected state governments have been toppled, disrespecting people's mandates. She also criticised the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis. "Decades of progress in improving health care have been reversed by the mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic." Referring to the farmers' agitation, she alleged the government has refused to heed to their legitimate concerns. "We must ensure that those who feed us do not themselves starve. We have to make agriculture more sustainable, economically and ecologically," she said. She also alleged the misuse of laws and government agencies. "Doctored videos, planted evidence, and fake toolkits are all becoming weapons of intimidation and disinformation to suppress dissent," she alleged.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-310

Justice Rekha Palli granted time to the counsel for the Centre to seek instructions and listed the petition by Yarlagadda Kiran Chandra, General Secretary of Free Software Movement of India, which claims to be a national coalition of various regional and sectoral free software movements, for hearing on September 23. Learned counsel for the respondents, who appears on advance notice, prays for time to obtain instructions. List on September 23, 2021, the judge said in the August 13 order. In his petition, Chandra has prayed for a direction to Computer Emergency Respondent Team -India (CERT-In) to act on his representation and commence investigation and review the alleged data breaches. The petitioner has said that he wrote to the CERT-In on several occasions on the breaches of data of millions of users of Big Basket, Mobikwik, Domino's and Air India platforms, urging it to investigate and update the citizens, but no action was taken. He said that under Section 70B of the Information Technology Act, 2000, CERT-In is responsible for collecting and analysing information on cyber incidents and take emergency measures for handling cyber security incidents etc. The petition said that presently, since there is no law governing data protection in India and the aggrieved users do not have any legislative recourse against such breaches, an investigation by CERT-In on frequent data breaches at mass level is important to safeguard the privacy of users. The data breaches at MobiKwik, BigBasket, Air India and Domino's have leaked sensitive personal information of millions of users including their addresses, phone numbers, passport information, credit-debit card details, hashed passwords, bank accounts, KYC details. These breaches seriously impact the privacy of the users including their financial details and personal addresses, the petition reads.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-310
16-08-2021||India||Police seek time to argue UAPA bail plea for Delhi riots case ||A court here on Monday adjourned the hearing on the bail application of former Congress Councillor Ishrat Jahan in the Delhi riots conspiracy case till August 20, after the prosecutor sought more time and said that he cannot talk in the air. Jahan, along with several others, has been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in the case and they are accused of being the "masterminds" of the February 2020 violence, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured. Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad, who represents Delhi Police and was slated to argue on the bail plea today, sought an adjournment from Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat stating that he needs more time to prepare the case. Advocate Pradeep Teotia, appearing for Jahan, objected to the adjournment request and apprised ASJ Rawat that the matter is pending for the last six months. “I cannot argue like you. I need to be fully prepared. I cannot talk in the air,” the prosecutor told advocate Teotia, impelling the judge to intervene and ask them to not fight over petty issues or get personal with each other. Jahan's counsel had concluded his arguments on her bail plea on July 23 and the SPP was slated to argue before the court today. The matter will now be heard on August 20 at 11 am. Earlier, Jahan, through her lawyer, said that the investigating agency does not have an iota of evidence against her in the conspiracy case. She also asked if it was "wrong to have a political affiliation". Besides her, JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, former student leader Umar Khalid, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain and several others have also been booked under the anti-terror law. In June, the Delhi High Court had granted bail to Tanha, Narwal, and Kalita in the case, saying the State blurred the line between the right to protest and terrorist activity in anxiety to suppress dissent.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-310
16-08-2021||India||HC to ED: Respond to Avantha Group promoter's plea||The Delhi High Court Monday asked the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to respond to a plea by Avantha Group promoter Gautam Thapar, arrested in connection with a Rs 500-crore money laundering case, claiming that he was produced before the trial court after expiry of statutorily mandated 24 hours. Thapar has approached the high court challenging a trial court's August 5 order by which his plea to declare his arrest as illegal was dismissed without recording reasons. Justice Yogesh Khanna asked the ED to file within seven days, its counter affidavit to the two petitions filed by Thapar and listed the matter for further hearing on August 27. The high court was informed that Thapar, who was sent to 10-day ED custody, will be produced before the trial court later in the day. Advocate Vijay Aggarwal, representing Thapar, argued that the time of arrest shown in the arrest memo is 7;55 PM on August 3. However, the search and seizure was conducted by the ED officials at Thapar's place at 8:30 AM on August 3 and he was arrested at that time only. He said that on August 4, Thapar was produced before the special judge, PMLA, after the expiry of statutorily mandated 24 hours period contrary to the provisions of law and he was remanded ED custody for a day. On August 5, he was sent to 10 days in ED custody. Time of arrest is when the person is first to put to restraint, that is, 8:30 AM here and not the time of arrest recorded by the arresting officers. He was not produced before the court within 24 hours, Aggarwal argued. Besides, Thapar has also sought a copy of Enforcement Case information Report (ECIR) registered by the ED, the copy of reasons to believe that Thapar was guilty of offence of money laundering and a check-list prepared before the arrest. Additional Solicitor General S V Raju, representing the ED, said he would file a reply to the petitions and that there was no urgency in the matter. According to the ED, Thapar was arrested on August 3 night after the agency carried out raids against him and his linked businesses in Delhi and Mumbai. The agency had told the trial court that investigation revealed that around Rs 500 crore worth proceeds of crime were allegedly laundered through Oyster Buildwell Pvt Ltd (OBPL), Jhabua Power Ltd (JPL), Jhabua Power Investment Ltd (JPIL), Avantha Power & Infrastructure Ltd (APIL), Avantha Realty Ltd (ARL) etc. which were being controlled and beneficially owned directly or indirectly by Gautam Thapar. The probe revealed that sham agreements were made by these entities to fraudulently obtain huge amount running into more than 500 crore from Yes Bank and further by different modes of layering the tainted amount was laundered and the loan account thus turned NPA causing a loss of huge public money, it had alleged. The case is having international ramifications involving proceeds of crime stashed outside the country in form of immovable properties and bank accounts which is to be unearthed, it had said. The ED has been probing an alleged transaction between his company Avantha Realty, Yes Bank co-founder Rana Kapoor and his wife, who are already being investigated under the PMLA by the agency. The case of money laundering was registerd by the ED after taking cognisance of an FIR lodged by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). "The (CBI) FIR alleges that Rana Kapoor, then MD and CEO of Yes Bank Limited, obtained illegal gratification in the form of a property in a prime location in Delhi at much less than the realisable market value belonging to Avantha Reality Ltd for sanction of a loan to ARL and for extending concessions, relaxations and waivers in the already existing credit facilities provided to Avantha Group companies and for advancing new and additional loans to them by Yes Bank Ltd," the ED had said earlier. CBI had last year booked Kapoor and his wife Bindu for allegedly obtaining a bribe of Rs 307 crore through the purchase of a bungalow in a tony Delhi area from a realty firm at half the market price and facilitating around Rs 1,900 crore bank loans to it in return, the agency had said. The CBI suspected that the discounted transaction for the 1.2 acre-bungalow on Amrita Shergill Marg in Delhi was a gratification to Kapoor through the company Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd in return for non-realisation of over Rs 1,900 crore in loans from Yes Bank to Gautam Thapar-promoted Avantha Realty and group companies, it said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-310

The government told a bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana that this issue is "highly technical" and expertise was needed to examine the aspects. "There is nothing to hide. It needs examination by committee of experts. This is a highly technical issue. We will appoint eminent neutral experts from the field," Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the bench, which also comprised justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for senior journalists N Ram and Sashi Kumar who have filed a plea seeking probe into the snooping allegations, said the affidavit filed by the Centre does not say whether the government or its agencies had used the spyware. "We do not want the government, which might have used Pegasus or its agency might have used it, to set up a committee on its own," Sibal said during the hearing which is going on. Earlier in the day, the Centre filed an affidavit in the top court and said that a batch of petitions seeking an independent probe into the Pegasus snooping allegations are based on "conjectures and surmises" or on other unsubstantiated media reports. In its affidavit, the government said its position on the alleged Pegasus snooping has already been clarified in Parliament by IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. "A bare perusal of the captioned petition and other connected petitions makes it clear that the same are based on conjectures and surmises or on other unsubstantiated media reports or incomplete or uncorroborated material," the affidavit said. With a view to dispel any wrong narrative spread by certain vested interests and with an object of examining the issues raised, it said, the government will constitute a committee of experts. On August 10, the top court had taken exception to "parallel proceedings and debates" on social media on the snooping row by some petitioners and said that there must be some discipline and they must have "some faith in the system". The apex court is hearing a batch of pleas, including the one filed by the Editors Guild of India, seeking independent probe into the alleged Pegasus snooping matter. They are related to reports of alleged snooping by government agencies on eminent citizens, politicians and scribes by using Israeli firm NSO's spyware Pegasus. An international media consortium has reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on the list of potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus spyware. Earlier, during the hearing of the matter, the top court had said that allegations of Pegasus related snooping are "serious in nature" if reports on them are correct. It had also asked the petitioners whether they had made any efforts to file a criminal complaint on this. Editors Guild of India has sought in its plea that a special investigation team be set up to conduct a probe into reported surveillance of journalists and others.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-311

Of the total 4,31,642 deaths reported so far in the country, 1,35,039 were from Maharashtra, 36,979 from Karnataka, 34,519 from Tamil Nadu, 25,069 from Delhi, 22,784 from Uttar Pradesh, 18,601 from Kerala and 18,303 from West Bengal. The health ministry stressed that more than 70 per cent of the deaths occurred due to comorbidities. "Our figures are being reconciled with the Indian Council of Medical Research," the ministry said on its website, adding that the state-wise distribution of figures is subject to further verification and reconciliation.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-311

16-08-2021||India||Modi's I-day speech adds 'sabka prayas' to his 'sabka saath' slogan||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday paid tributes to freedom fighters, added “sabka prayas” (effort by all) to his “sabka saath” slogan, described the youth as the “can-do generation” and asked them to take the country forward. Addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort to mark the start of the 75th year of independence, Modi urged people to strive collectively (sabka prayas) to take the country to new heights by the 100th year of independence. Beyond such exhortations and slogans, however, his speech contained little by way of a road map for the future. “The journey of the next 25 years is the divine period of the creation of a new India,” the Prime Minister said. “Aaj Lal Kile se main avhan kar raha hoon: Sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas aur sabka prayas hamare har lakshyon ki prapti ke liye bahut mahatwapurn hai (I’m urging you from the Red Fort today: Solidarity with all, development for all, trust from all and effort by all are very important for us to reach all our goals),” he said. Modi had begun his speech by remembering the freedom fighters. He referred to the pain of Partition and reiterated that his government would observe August 14 as “Partition Horrors Remembrance Day” — a decision announced on Saturday that many saw as an attempt to polarise people by taking a dig at Pakistan. Modi played up his government’s schemes and spoke of expanding their reach, referring to “100 per cent India” and “saturation”. “Now we have to move towards saturation. We have to make sure that 100 per cent villages have roads, 100 per cent households have bank accounts, 100 per cent beneficiaries have Ayushman Bharat cards and 100 per cent of those eligible have a gas connection,” he said. Modi announced a PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan for holistic infrastructure development to help local manufacturers turn globally competitive. “All manufacturers should target the global market. India should become the hub of the global market,” he said, adding that this would generate huge employment opportunities. In his Independence Day speech last year, too, Modi had spoken of turning India into a global manufacturing hub. His slogan then had been “Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India)”. Claiming that his government had brought remarkable changes to the lives of the deprived sections, the Prime Minister announced a plan to introduce fortified rice for the poor under various schemes. Experts had recently cautioned that a government proposal for mandatory fortification of rice with iron to combat anaemia was based on flawed assumptions and haemoglobin measurements, and could harm segments of the population through excessive iron intake. Citing climate change, Modi announced a national hydrogen mission: “We have to make India a hub for the production and export of green hydrogen.” Green hydrogen is a hydrogen-produced fuel that is made from renewable energy sources instead of fossil fuels. Modi announced 75 Vande Bharat trains that would connect every corner of the country, and said Sainik schools would be opened for girls too. He referred briefly to the devastation caused by the pandemic before moving on to more upbeat themes. Some 32 Indian athletes who had participated in the Tokyo Olympics had been invited to the event: Modi called on the nation to applaud them and held them up as a symbol of the country’s youth power. “My faith is in the country’s youth. My faith is in the country’s sisters, daughters, farmers and professionals. This is a can-do generation; they can achieve every goal,” Modi said. He wound up with a poem that suggested that India’s time had come.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-311
16-08-2021||India||CJI Ramana regrets lack of debate in Parliament and state legislatures||Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana on Sunday regretted the lack of debate in Parliament and state legislatures, his remark coming against the backdrop of the Centre railroading several bills through Parliament without discussion during the just-ended monsoon session. Justice Ramana said the Houses once witnessed elaborate discussions over every bill and rued that the lack of quality debate nowadays often led to legislation riddled with “ambiguities” and “gaps in law”. “I still remember the debates which used to take place in the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and various state legislatures,” the Chief Justice said at the Independence Day celebrations on the Supreme Court lawns. “Unfortunately, over a period of time, you know what’s happening in the Houses, whether it is Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, if you see the debates that used to take place in the House, were very, very nice and constructive debates….” In the monsoon session, the Narendra Modi government passed 19 bills with hardly any discussion as the Opposition stalled proceedings demanding debates on issues such as the Pegasus snooping controversy. “It’s a sorry state of affairs (now). We see legislation and laws being passed with a lot of ambiguities and lots of gaps in law. There is no clarity regarding the laws. We don’t know for what purpose a law has been made. This creates a lot of litigation, inconvenience and loss to the government and inconvenience to the general public,” Justice Ramana said. “That’s what happens if intellectuals and professionals like lawyers are not there in the House. I don’t want to say more than this, but it is time the legal community take the lead in making laws, to participate actively in social and public life.” The Chief Justice recalled that Parliament and the state legislatures once boasted large numbers of legal experts as members. He cited how CPM parliamentarian P. Ramamurti from Tamil Nadu (who had been an MP for 16 years between 1960 and 1983) had contributed extensively to a debate on the various contours of the Industrial Disputes Act. Justice Ramana said the leaders of the freedom struggle like Mahatma Gandhi, Vallabhbhai Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru and Rajendra Prasad were lawyers. Later, apart from Gandhi, the rest became parliamentarians. He exhorted the senior lawyers present: “I don’t want you all to confine yourselves to only your profession of earning money and living comfortably. Please think over as you must also participate in public life. I hope your knowledge, wisdom and experience will help the country and people will feel happy.” Justice Ramana praised the Supreme Court’s role over the past 75 years, saying it had not just interpreted the Constitution but gone beyond it to grant rights and privileges to the underprivileged. Turning nostalgic, Justice Ramana recalled how he had taken great enjoyment in Independence Day celebrations as a schoolboy. “I still remember, I was aged around 10 years. Those days when we used to go to school we were given some jaggery pieces and some murmura (rice flakes), yet we used to enjoy,” he said. “(The) small things which we used to get in school — we used to feel happy and proud of the events.” He added: “Today is a very happy and historic day. Apart from celebrating Independence Day it is time to rethink and review our policies, as to what we have achieved and what we have to achieve in our future days. “Seventy-five years is not a small time in a country’s history. But at the same time we have to look into the vast population and geographical conditions of the country, particularly when we got Independence.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-311

The Kabul mission is now India’s only functional diplomatic post in Afghanistan. A routine Air India flight which had to hover in the skies above Kabul for over an hour early Sunday afternoon before managing to land in the midst of the Taliban siege of the capital left the city in the evening with 129 passengers. While Air India has not yet cancelled its scheduled services to Kabul, India — according to sources — has Indian Air Force flights on stand-by; ready to proceed to Afghanistan for evacuation of diplomats and other Indians still in the country.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-311
16-08-2021||India||Jammu and Kashmir: Hundreds of Tricolor hoisted amid shutdown||The Valley on Sunday hosted for the first-time hundreds of Tricolor-hoisting ceremonies but a near total shutdown against the Independence Day celebrations played spoilsport for the government. Kashmiris have traditionally stayed away from the national commemorations like Independence Day or Republic Day but there was a virtual riot of colours at stadiums, schools, colleges and other government institutions on Sunday. The administration illuminated the city’s iconic landmark, Ghanta Ghar, in colours of the Tricolour and hoisted a massive national flag at centuries old monument atop Hari Parbat hill. Several local newspapers, also in a first, splashed messages on front pages greeting their readers on Independence Day. The events came in response to government orders making it mandatory for heads of educational institutions to unfurl the flag, as part of a two-year-old campaign beginning with the scrapping of special status to fully integrate Kashmir with the country. Official sources said e-mails were sent to newspapers with a direction to greet readers, although a government official dismissed it as “fake news”. Several newspapers greeted readers but some skipped the greetings. Over the past two years, the government could not “enforce” such events because it had enforced a lockdown. “Independence Day will be celebrated in all schools. Directions should be conveyed to all the CEOs, principals/headmasters to hoist national flag at all schools. Videos and photos of the event will be uploaded on Google drive,” a government order last week said. Thousands of teachers and students participated in the preparations over the past several days for the flag-hoisting events, although educational institutions have remained shut for two years because of repeated lockdowns. The government had relaxed Covid-19 restrictions on gatherings for August 15 events. Among many school heads obliging was Muzaffar Wani, father of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani whose killing in 2016 led to a civilian unrest. Wani is a headmaster of a government school in Tral and his pictures unfurling the national flag were widely shared on social media. The Valley, however, observed a complete shutdown. The markets were shut and the roads deserted, suggesting the participation in Independence Day events was not all voluntary. Top politicians, including Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, chose not to greet people on social media. A schoolteacher in Srinagar said the fear of losing jobs or harassment forced many teachers to fall in line. The government has in recent weeks terminated at least 18 government employees for their alleged azadi links and enquiries were held, which has instilled fear among the employees. A government spokesperson, however, said the celebrations were held with great fervour and enthusiasm and “rekindled the spirit of the Indian freedom movement.” Many on social media, however, expressed outrage over the “forced hoisting” of the national flag. Sabbah Haji, who runs a non-profit school in Jammu’s Doda, regretted the government was “doing school-by-school phone calls” to check whether they hoisted flags, rather checking “status of teaching and students” in the schools.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-311
16-08-2021||India|| Nitish Kumar announces revival of bazaar samitis in Bihar||Chief minister Nitish Kumar has announced the revival of bazaar samitis in Bihar, a U-turn in policy that is likely to be resented by ally BJP and welcomed by the farmers agitating in several states against three new farm laws. One of the three laws does away with the need for bazaar samitis — called mandis in some places — a provision the farmers fear will leave them to be exploited by big companies that buy farm produce. Bazaar samitis are government-regulated markets where farmers sell their produce to middlemen with the government expected to ensure they are not exploited. These markets had shut down after the Nitish government repealed the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee Act in 2006, deciding that reining in the middlemen was a hopeless task. However, some of the middlemen retained their stalls at the erstwhile bazaar samitis and many farmers continued to sell there, but without government infrastructure or supervision. “Agriculture bazaar samitis will be revived, renovated and developed in a phased manner in the state to provide a market to the farmers for their produce,” Nitish said in an Independence Day announcement. “We shall spend Rs 2,700 crore on this. Separate market and cold storage facilities will be provided at the bazaar samitis for food grains, fruits, vegetables and fish.” Farmers are agitating in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and a few other states apart from conducting a nine-month-old sit-in at Delhi’s borders. One of their demands is an assurance that mandis will continue to function. Nitish’s announcement comes amid a continuing strain in relations between his Janata Dal United and the BJP since the October-November Assembly elections last year. The JDU with 43 seats has to play second fiddle to the BJP, which won 74 seats. Nitish’s lieutenants have indicated they believe that the BJP sabotaged their party’s electoral prospects through various ploys, including covert support to erstwhile ally Chirag Paswan who fielded Lok Janshakti Party candidates against the JDU. The JDU has differed from the BJP on several issues recently, demanding a caste census and a probe into the Pegasus snooping allegations and opposing the new citizenship regime, two-child norms for elections, the amendment to Article 370 and talk about a uniform civil code. In his Independence Day speech, Nitish announced that all villages in Bihar would be covered by milk cooperative societies, with women managing 40 per cent of the new societies that would be created. Nitish said his government would ensure that the state-run Sudha Dairy’s products, now available only in the cities, are marketed at all the towns and block headquarters over the next four years. He said the state would expand the facilities to produce ethanol from sugarcane, molasses and maize. He also announced the establishment of three new colleges to teach agricultural biotechnology, agricultural engineering and agri-business management under the Bihar Agriculture University at Sabour, Bhagalpur. Bihar will also have an eco-tourism wing under the department of environment and forests. Nitish announced an increase in the dearness allowance from 17 per cent to 28 per cent with effect from July 1 this year. The Centre had recently hiked dearness allowance for its employees.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-312
16-08-2021||India||Time to reduce dependence on personalities||I was the accidental finance minister in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee which took office in March 1998. Jaswant Singh was the finance minister in the earlier 13-day Vajpayee government in 1996 and he was the hot favourite for the post again in 1998. But he unfortunately lost the Lok Sabha election in 1998 and Vajpayee was advised by the RSS, I believe, not to include in his cabinet those who had lost the Lok Sabha elections. So, both Jaswant Singh and Pramod Mahajan were out, having lost the Lok Sabha elections. So, the million-rupee question was, who should become the finance minister? Earlier, I had been told by friends in the know of things that I was likely to get the commerce ministry. I was extremely happy, having served in that ministry in India and abroad for seven years when I was in the IAS. But ultimately things turned out differently. I understand that it was (L.K.) Advani who persuaded the Prime Minister to give me the finance portfolio since I was the party’s spokesperson on economic issues, Sushma Swaraj being the main spokesperson on all other issues. This is how, purely accidentally, I became the finance minister in the Vajpayee government. I had won my Lok Sabha seat, no doubt, but I was not a leader of any consequence even in the party. My stature in government was thus completely out of proportion to my standing in the party and led to many problems. For one, ministers who considered themselves senior to me in the party would often invite me to their office for a discussion on some issue or the other and I would oblige, with my officers in tow, if necessary. It was the peon in my office who told me one day, with great hesitation, that this was not done. The practice was that if a minister had some issue to discuss with the finance minister, she would ask for time and come to the finance ministry; the finance minister did not go from “bhawan” to “bhawan” to discuss matters. Not only that: the finance minister had the authority to summon other ministers to the finance ministry for discussions. After this veiled admonition, I changed the practice and everyone fell in line immediately. It was that easy. The only exceptions I made, deliberately, were for L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and George Fernandes, though George was extremely informal in such matters and would often walk across from the South to the North Block for a discussion. It took me a while, thus, to get over my earlier hesitation and start behaving like the finance minister of India. But in this piece I want to raise another issue. Quite early in my days in the finance ministry, it was brought to my notice by my officers that a long pending issue was the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) at the state level. We already had Modvat at the central level and were slowly proceeding in the direction of central VAT. I decided to take the matter up with the states and called a meeting of chief ministers. I did not go running to the Prime Minister to seek his permission to call such a meeting, nor did I consider it necessary to invite him to inaugurate the conference. I felt confident because I had realised by then that Vajpayee’s policy was to give full freedom to his ministers to function in their respective domains. So I called this meeting, conducted it myself and at the end of it suggested to the chief ministers to form a committee to take matters further. I also suggested that Jyoti Basu, the CPM chief minister of West Bengal, should head the committee. The suggestion was accepted unanimously as indeed was my suggestion later that a state finance ministers’ committee be constituted and headed by Asim Dasgupta, the finance minister of West Bengal. Later, the chief ministers agreed to convert the finance ministers’ committee into an empowered one. The process I adopted became a shining example of cooperative federalism and the precursor to the present GST Council, indeed of the GST itself. I kept the Prime Minister fully informed of the developments on this front from time to time. Never once did Vajpayee or the officials of the Prime Minister’s Office ever suggest to me that the Prime Minister or the PMO should also be involved in the exercise. Never once did they interfere with the work I was doing on this issue or any other. I was wondering what would have happened to me if I had dared to take such an initiative in this government. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister in our system is not merely the primus inter pares but the supreme ultimate authority in all matters. So, he does not have to assert his authority in small matters, especially of detail, to prove that he is the boss. A Prime Minister’s authority is a given and accepted by all without demur. It is this development in the parliamentary system of government that has largely obliterated the difference between the parliamentary and presidential systems of democratic governance. So, people have no hesitation in asking today that if such and such party has so and so leader, who do you have to match her? They forget that in our parliamentary system the people elect members of Parliament or state legislatures, who then elect their leader, i.e. the chief minister or the Prime Minister. The phenomenon of the Prime Minister gradually emerging as the big boss did not go unnoticed even in the UK, the mother of parliamentary democracy. It did cause concern too. Lord Hewart, the Lord Chief Justice of England, wrote a book, The New Despotism, which was published in 1929. In it he described the new despotism as an attempt to subordinate Parliament, to evade courts and to render the will or the caprice of the executive unfettered and supreme. The book did create a flutter for some time but soon the trend of the executive assuming unbridled power became an irreversible trend, not only in England but also in all those countries that followed the Westminster model. Even in India, where we have been so proud of our democracy, this trend has now become deeply rooted. The Constitution of India provides for balance between the three organs of the State: the executive, legislature and the judiciary. But over time this has become dependent on the personality of the person heading these three branches. This dependence on personalities is not a healthy development for our polity. We therefore need wide-ranging reforms today to re-establish the constitutional balance envisaged by the founding fathers of our Constitution. Until then we are destined to suffer the aberration that afflicts our polity today. Yashwant Sinha is a former Union finance minister||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-312
16-08-2021||India||Odisha govt rolls out Smart Health Cards for 3.5 crore people ||The Odisha government on Sunday rolled out Smart Health Cards for 3.5 crore people in the state under the Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana. The BSKY, the flagship health programme of the state, focuses mainly on providing health services to the economically vulnerable section of the society. Odisha is the first state in the country to provide such smart health cards to its citizens. Announcing this while unfurling the national flag here on the 75th Independence Day, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik said the initiative of his government would transform the health service delivery system and create history in the health sector of the country. Around 3.5 crore people of 96 lakh families will get this Smart Health Card. This card will be given to all the beneficiaries phasewise. “Beneficiaries of National and State Food Security Schemes, Annapurna and Antyodaya will get this card,” Naveen said. Annapurna and Antyodaya are both subsidised rice schemes for the poor. Under the BSKY, each family can avail free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh per annum. In the case of women the limit has been extended to Rs 10 lakh every year. The beneficiaries can avail health services in more than 200 hospital chains of the country, including Odisha. “It will go a long way in strengthening the health security of people of Odisha,” Naveen said. The BSKY was launched on August 15, 2018, with an objective to provide universal health coverage, with special emphasis on health protection of economically vulnerable families. Earlier, people in order to avail the benefits under the BSKY had to show their BPL card, ration card or the income certificates (below Rs 50,000) obtained from the local tehsildar. “Now people need not to show all these things and waste their time in collecting certificates. They will just show the health cards at the hospitals and avail the health service without any hassle. It is people-friendly,” officials maintained. The Odisha government considers that its BSKY is better than the Government of India’s Ayushman Bharat health scheme. Despite the requests made by the Centre to join hands with Ayushman Bharat scheme, Odisha has far declined to accept it. The Odisha government has maintained that all premier healthcare institutions across the country, including Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, CMC Vellore, Narayan Hrudayalaya, have been covered under the BSKY. Similarly, all government hospitals of the state government and health centres are also included in the BSKY.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-312
16-08-2021||India||Odisha government for ‘direct election’ of mayors||The Naveen Patnaik government has issued a draft notification to amend the Odisha Municipal Rules, 1994, to hold “direct election” for the posts of mayors of municipal corporations and chairpersons of municipalities and notified area councils and sought public opinion on the issue. Suggestions and grievances in this regard can be lodged with the principal secretary, housing and urban development, within a month. Currently, corporators and councillors elect the mayors of municipal corporations and chairpersons of the municipalities and notified area councils, respectively. According to the draft notification issued on Friday, a candidate can fight for both the councillor and chairman’s post. But he or she will retain only one if elected to both the posts. The authority will place two ballot boxes, one for the election of the chairpersons and other for the councillor, during polling. The civic polls in the state have been delayed by over two years. The state is yet to amend the existing laws to determine reservations and delimitations of seats. The tenure of 65 civic bodies, including the Berhampur Municipal Corporation, expired in September 2018, while the tenure of 48 urban local bodies, including the Sambalpur, Rourkela and Bhubaneswar municipal corporations expired in February 2019.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-312
