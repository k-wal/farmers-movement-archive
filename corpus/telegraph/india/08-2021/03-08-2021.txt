03-08-2021||India||‘Edge’ of warfare in Afghanistan will be deeply felt if left unattended: Jaishankar||India on Tuesday warned that the “edge” of the warfare in Afghanistan, if left unattended, will be deeply felt not just in that country's neighbourhood but well beyond, and emphasised that legitimacy cannot be derived from mass violence, brutal intimidation or covert agendas. In an address at the inaugural session of BRICS academic forum, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also said that the warfare in Afghanistan has "sharpened the challenge" of terrorism and therefore, all stakeholders are in the quest for a clear, coordinated and undifferentiated response to terrorism. In his virtual address, he said structural inertia, competitive gridlocks, uneven resourcing and skewed navigation have disadvantaged the multilateral institutions, resulting in certain “gaps”. “Terrorism thrives in some of these gaps. Its nursery lies in conflict-ridden spaces made fertile for radicalisation by malign players, including states. The transition in Afghanistan that we are seeing today and the warfare that has yet again been forced upon its people has sharpened this challenge. “Left unattended, its edge will be deeply felt not just in Afghanistan's neighbourhood but well beyond,” the minister said. “We are therefore all stakeholders in the quest for a clear, coordinated and undifferentiated response to terrorism. In the 21st century, legitimacy cannot be derived from mass violence, brutal intimidation or covert agendas. Representation, inclusion, peace and stability are inextricably linked,” he added. The Taliban has been making rapid advances across Afghanistan by resorting to widespread violence since the US began withdrawing its troops on May 1. The US has already pulled back the majority of its forces and is looking to complete the drawdown by August 31. Jaishankar also called for reform of the multilateral institutions saying an “updating and recalibration” of the post-World War II multilateral architecture cannot be postponed any further. The pandemic and the normative breakdown in its wake have "rudely" reminded us that institutions built to tackle problems of the 1940s desperately need to be upgraded and made fit-for-purpose for our century, he said. He said an expansion of the permanent membership of the UN Security Council is a necessary ingredient but by itself, it is not sufficient. “Multilateral institutions have been disadvantaged by structural inertia, competitive gridlocks, uneven resourcing and skewed navigation. The proliferation of new and smaller platforms, including of plurilateral and regional groups, is, therefore, a response to such felt gaps,” he said. “BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa) itself was actually among the earliest in this regard. Too often, we obsess with one or the other response; more effort and action is actually required to fill the gaps,” Jaishankar said. On dealing with Covid-19, he talked about the imbalance between the emphasis on intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry and the meeting of public health goals. Left untouched, the current practices will only delay the elimination of the pandemic by several years, he said, and added that “this is simply not acceptable. But beyond health is a larger economic lesson for the world from the pandemic”. Jaishankar said the creation of more reliable and resilient supply chains is vital to infuse greater confidence in the global economy and in fact to de-risk it from future pandemics. The global South is particularly vulnerable in that regard. Investments must diversify to provide a certain assurance of sustainability for livelihoods, for families and communities, and of course for the natural environment, he said. About BRICS, he said its birth was an implicit recognition that the post-war order had peaked and emerging economies needed to step up to craft a new developmental framework. He said BRICS was a response to the search for diversity; in many ways, it was accurate anticipation of multipolarity. “So, let us, therefore, remember that counter-dominance instinct and principled commitment to multipolarity in all forms political and economic, academic and institutional, social and cultural is written into the DNA of BRICS,” Jaishankar said. He said it was in this spirit of independence and complementarity that India co-founded BRICS. He said India is confident that this sentiment will continue to define not just BRICS but the larger template for coming decades of the 21st century. BRICS is a statement of global rebalancing that underlines its essential diversity and pluralism, he added. The external affairs minister also said India's presidency of BRICS is underpinned by four pillars — reform of the multilateral system; counter-terrorism cooperation; technological and digital solutions for sustainable development goals and enhancing people-to-people cooperation. “These pillars may seem abstract or even perennial, but each one of them actually has an explicit, real-world meaning,” he said. In his address, Jaishankar also talked about emerging technologies, adding, digital technology and the energies of the internet, are a force multiplier in any avenue of human endeavour.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-359

03-08-2021||India||Delhi: Fury over Dalit girl's alleged rape and murder||The fury over the alleged rape and murder of a nine-year-old Dalit girl in Delhi Cantonment is growing with locals as well top political leaders expressing anguish. Demands for quick action and justice have been raised from multiple sides. Residents of Old Nangal village in the cantonment, where the girl lived with her family, have been protesting since Sunday night when the incident came to be reported. The hurried cremation of the child's body has drawn comparison with the Uttar Pradesh's Hathras case from September 2020. Then, too, the rape victim's body was disposed of in the cover of night, allegedly without the parents' consent. The move was seen as an attempt to destroy evidence. On Sunday, too, Radhey Shyam, the priest of the cremation ground where the rape and murder allegedly took place, coerced the victim's family into cremating the body. The girl's mother later told the media and the police that by the time she and her relatives managed to douse the flames, only the girl's feet could be salvaged. The child had gone there to get some water from the facility's cooler, the police said. Following her failure to return even after a long time, the girl's family received a phone call telling them about the girl's death by electrocution. Her parents later raised an alarm and gathered the locals. While four persons, including the priest, have been arrested by the Delhi police, demands for quick action have been pouring in from a cross section of people, especially on social media. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, too, commented on similar lines. "Dalit's child is also the nation's daughter," he tweeted in Hindi along with the screen shot of a news report of the incident. His comment comes amid several Indian sportswomen earning heaps of praise for their performance in the ongoing Tokyo Olympics. Shuttler PV Sindhu and the entire Indian women's hockey team, besides others, have often been referred to as "the country's daughters" by many following their stellar display. The Delhi Chief Minister, meanwhile, pledged help to seek justice for the nine-year-old. "The murder of the 9-year-old in Delhi after being ravaged was extremely shameful. There is a need to strengthen law and order in the city. The accused must get the death sentence as soon as possible," Kejriwal tweeted today. "From Prime Minister to Home minister everyone lives here still there is no sense of safety for women. Why has the Chief Minister not met the victim's parents yet? He lives only a few kilometres from here," he had said earlier. "I'll be meeting the victim's family tomorrow. We'll help them in all ways in their battle for justice." Dalit leader and Bhim Army Chief Chandra Shekhar Azad, meanwhile, said their team was already present amid the protesters in Nangal village. He met the bereaved family today. "This is my own family. She was my sister," Azad tweeted in Hindi.' "From Prime Minister to Home minister everyone lives here still there is no sense of safety for women. Why has the Chief Minister not met the victim's parents yet? He lives only a few kilometres from here," he had said earlier. The Delhi Commission for Women, calling the incident "serious" and meriting "urgent attention", has instituted a panel to carry out a probe. Summoning the Deputy Commissioner of Police of South West District, Chairperson Swati Maliwal has demanded the "complete case file" of the matter, copies of the FIR and various statements, and other details.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-359

He stressed that the real issue was the hurried passing of bills in both the Houses without any discussions and even went on to say that the prime minister's reaction showed that the "TMC is setting the agenda". "Passing laws or making paapri chaat," O'Brien had said on Monday taking a swipe at the government and noting that 12 bills were passed at an average time of under seven minutes in Parliament. On Tuesday, Union minister Pralhad Joshi said that PM Modi was anguished over the comment and found it "insulting to the people who elect MPs". "The TMC is setting the agenda and the PM is replying. Nowhere has the PM disputed the number we have put out of seven minutes. It is a cultural idiom that people understand. Would PM be happier if I used 'dhokla' instead?" the Trinamool Congress leader later told reporters. Dhokla is a popular Gujarati snack. "I speak in the language of the people. I have taken a serious fact and used a popular cultural idiom to spread the message," O'Brien said. The MP and his Lok Sabha colleague Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar served 'chaat' to mediapersons on Tuesday and even had their share of the savoury snack.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-359

I asked them that the matter should be investigated in a fast-track manner. The statement of the parents should be immediately recorded without any delay," he said. "There should be a thorough investigation in the matter. If we feel that the investigation is not carried out properly, then the Delhi government will conduct a magisterial inquiry," Gautam had said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-359

This comes in the form of crossing the borders, as well as content-wise. Then there are new initiatives and team-ups with the bigger names too. So, OtakuKart is the one big name from India that The Artistree is about to go on a journey with.The Artistree hopes to expand its horizons in the fields of Anime and Gaming. Something Otakukart built itself upon. Another new initiative, The Artistree is aiming to bring is the one called "Artist Feature". The company believes it could turn out successful with a little help from their friends of Otakukart The Artist Feature probably comes from the origins of The Artistree’s main motive from the time they started as a company in 2016. It began with posting news about Films, Music, and Television Shows. The secret main motives here was to give the artists behind these works the recognition they needed. Something that could be done by hearing the insights, hard work, and ideas these artists came up with. Lastly what their art speaks out loud. So, The Artistree with the same motive and name has been building that for themselves. It seems like working with Otakukart has made it easier. Now the team of these companies is working in full swing towards it. Otakukart on their part already has Artist Feature articles of their own. They prefer to call it Artist Focus. So far they have covered artists such as Edward Ameen and Attack on Cuisine. Talking with Edward Ameen, he revealed to OtakuKart his humble beginnings of wanting to be a photographer growing up. The obstacles and challenges he faced, anime, and things he loves about pop culture. Also how he feels about his working getting recognition around the world and the advice he would give to young aspiring photographers. OtakuKart also sat with Attack on Cuisine to embrace their journey of Anime-inspired cooking. Their ups and downs, Chef life, their favorite recipe. Then what it means to be a distinct Anime chef and much more. So these two interviews were just the beginnings of the bigger initiative The Artistree and OtakuKart are aiming to bring forward through Artist Feature. We may have more popular names who started from the bottom and reached the top with the unique art they brought to the world. Something which shouldn’t go unnoticed by the wider audience. These may range from actors to filmmakers, to chefs, to sports personalities, to musicians to dancers. Both the dedicated fan bases of The Artistree and OtakuKart coming together might result in the much-needed success of this brilliant and interesting initiative.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-359
03-08-2021||India|| Reproductive number of Covid-19 more than 1 in eight states, warns health ministry||The government on Tuesday said India's reproductive number, or R-factor, which denotes the spread of Covid-19 is more than one in eight states, including Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Reproduction or reproduction number is a measure that highlights the number of people a coronavirus positive person infects, thereby reflecting the severity of its spread. A number of one or below one indicates a slowly spreading virus while any number above 1 indicates a rapid spread. An official said the pandemic is far from over, and the second wave, as far as India is concerned, is still not over. The daily new Covid-19 cases being reported across the world are still high as more than 4.7 lakh infections are being recorded everyday, the official added. The government said 44 districts across 12 states and Union Territories reported more than 10 per cent weekly Covid-19 positivity rate in the week ending August 2. "Delta variant is a dominant problem. The pandemic is still raging and the second wave is persisting in our own country," Dr VK Paul, who heads the government's Covid task force, was quoted as saying by ndtv.com. "Please remember that R number should be 0.6 or below. If it has gone over 1, it shows it is a significant problem and the virus wants to spread," he added. Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra are the only states showing a downward trajectory, while the R-value in states like Bengal, Nagaland, Haryana, Goa, Delhi and Jharkhand stands at 1. "Whenever R number is above one, it means that the case trajectory is increasing and it needs to be controlled," said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary of the Union health ministry. The Centre said that 18 districts from six states, including Kerala, Maharashtra, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh, reported an increasing trend in daily new Covid cases in last four weeks. It added that in the last week, 49.85 per cent of the total coronavirus cases were reported from Kerala. The government also said that the total number of Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in July is more than double that in May. The total number of Covid vaccine doses administered so far as part of the nationwide vaccination drive has reached 47.85 crore. India's Covid-19 tally climbed to 3,17,26,507 on Tuesday with 30,549 more people testing positive for the disease while the active caseload declined after six days, according to the health ministry data. The death toll climbed to 4,25,195 with 422 fresh fatalities, the data updated at 8 am showed.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-359

03-08-2021||India||Four more pharma firms to start Covid jab production by November, says Union minister||Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday said in Parliament that four more Indian pharma firms are expected to start anti-coronavirus vaccine production by October-November that will accelerate the inoculation drive. During the Question Hour in the Rajya Sabha, Mandaviya said India has administered 47 crore doses of vaccine so far and the Centre is making efforts to inoculate the entire country at the earliest. "Even 7 to 9 per cent of the doses that remain unutilised by private hospitals are being used by the government vaccination centres," he added. Mandaviya was speaking amid a din in the house over the Opposition's demand for a discussion on the Pegasus issue and the farm laws. "Vaccination drive is going on smoothly... It will get more accelerated in the coming days with the ramping up of production by four more Indian companies," the minister said. "The government expects that by October-November, four more Indian pharmaceutical companies will start production of indigenous vaccines that will help meet the domestic demand. "Biologicals E and Novartis vaccines will also be available in the market in the coming days, while Zydus Cadila will soon get an emergency-use nod from an expert committee," the Union Health Minister said. "At present two companies (Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute) are supplying the vaccine to the government. Sputnik vaccine is also available and production of which has begun," he added. To a query by BJD member Amar Patnaik about the vaccine rollout plan for 12-18-year-old and the need for a third or fourth dose, Mandaviya said, "The government's target is to vaccinate the entire population at the earliest and constant efforts are being made to achieve this." Unlike BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and polio vaccines that came to India much later after its launch in other parts of the world, the vaccine against coronavirus was made available in India at the same time in the world due to the efforts of the Narendra Modi government, he said. "The prime minister took steps, supported scientists and companies to ensure vaccines were available in the country at the earliest," the minister said. "Thus vaccination drives began in India which has administered 47 crore doses so far, the maximum in the world. We are going to accelerate it further in the coming days," he said. Responding to BJP member Susheel Kumar Modi's query on the government's plan to reduce the vaccine quota to private hospitals, the minister said it was not necessary as the unused vaccine quota of the private hospitals is taken by the government. "In a month, we saw seven to nine per cent unused vaccines by private hospitals. So, we decided to take those unutilised doses in the government quota. Therefore, it is not necessary to reduce the quota for the private. The vaccination is happening smoothly," he said. The Centre is buying 75 per cent of the vaccine produced to give free jabs to people, while 25 per cent is allocated for the private sector, the health minister added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-360
03-08-2021||India||Editors Guild files plea in SC, seeks SIT probe into Pegasus snooping||The Editors Guild of India has filed a plea in the Supreme Court seeking that a special investigation team (SIT) be set up to conduct probe into the reported surveillance of journalists and others allegedly by the government through the use Israeli firm NSO's Pegasus spyware. The guild's petition has stated that journalists are tasked with enforcing the public's right to be informed, accountability and to an open and transparent government. The guild's members and all journalists have the duty of holding all branches of government accountable by seeking information, explanations and constitutionally valid justifications for state action and inaction, it said. To be able to fulfil this role, freedom of the press must be safeguarded, it said. Journalist Mrinal Pande is a co-petitioner in the case. Freedom of the press relies on non-interference by the government and its agencies in reporting of journalists, including their ability to securely and confidentially speaking with sources, investigate abuse of power and corruption, expose governmental incompetence, and speak with those in opposition to the government, the plea said. The guild submitted that citizens of India have a right to know if the government is infringing upon the limits of their authority under the Constitution and what steps have been taken to safeguard their fundamental rights. The plea stated that all attempts to seek accountability and enforce Constitutional limits through Parliamentary processes have been stonewalled. Through their intransigence, the Respondents have deliberately avoided public debate on this issue and have provided obfuscated answers, forcing the Petitioner to approach this Court, the plea said. The guild has sought a court-appointed and monitored SIT to investigate every aspect of the alleged use of Pegasus by the Government of India and against Indian citizens, especially journalists. It has challenged the constitutional vires of electronic surveillance, hacking and use of spyware, and the existing legal architecture for surveillance, in light of the gigantic leaps in technology and surveillance capabilities. On Monday, a senior journalist, whose name featured in the reported list of those who were targets of snooping using Pegasus, had moved the apex court seeking directions to the Centre to disclose materials with respect to investigation and authorisation pertaining to alleged use of Israeli spyware on his mobile. Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, who said existence of Pegasus will have a tremendous chilling effect on the right to free speech in India, has urged the apex court to declare that use of malware or spyware is illegal and unconstitutional. A bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana is scheduled to hear on August 5 three separate pleas, including the one filed by senior journalists N Ram and Sashi Kumar who have sought an independent probe by a sitting or a retired judge into the alleged Pegasus snooping matter. An international media consortium has reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on a list of potential targets for surveillance using Israeli firm NSO's Pegasus spyware||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-360
03-08-2021||India||BJP MPs armed with info to take on government critics||With the government's handling of Covid-19 being a major public issue, BJP MPs on Tuesday were given a detailed note on the government's response to the pandemic and the ongoing vaccination drive in an attempt by the party to arm its lawmakers with information to take on the critics. The booklets, prepared by the Health and Family Welfare Ministry, claim all efforts to counter the disease cannot be attributed to just the Union or state governments but to "Team India" which acted with a "whole of government and whole of society" approach in a pre-emptive, proactive and graded manner. Opposition parties have been attacking the Narendra Modi dispensation and the BJP governments in poll-bound states such as Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Goa for their handling of the pandemic. They have also accused the central government of not doing enough to vaccinate people at a fast pace. The ministry's note argues that India has delivered the highest vaccine doses compared to other countries for which "transparent" data is available in the public domain. China has claimed to have given 160 crore doses, it added. India has by July-end administered over 45 crore doses compared to 34.3 crore in the US and 13.7 crore in Brazil and 8.4 crore in the UK, it said. India took 166 days to reach the mark of 34 crore vaccine doses against 221 days by the US, the note stated. India has so far administered over 10 per cent of the doses given globally. Referring to India's handling of the pandemic, the note claims that the country managed to "evade" the catastrophic effects of the pandemic which had wreaked havoc in the world. It also highlights the government's efforts to distribute required medicines and medical oxygen, besides the measures to ramp up the supply of the life-saving gas. PM Modi, it notes, held 21 meetings with states, addressed the nation 10 times and chaired a total of 40 meetings. India's Covid-19 cases at 22,726 per million and fatality at 305 per million at are among the "lowest" in the world, it said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-360

03-08-2021||India||Lok Sabha passes Essential Defence Services Bill amid Opposition protests||Lok Sabha on Tuesday passed a bill that seeks to prohibit any agitation and strike by anyone engaged in essential defence services. Amid protests by some opposition members on the intent of the bill, Minister of State for Defence Ajay Bhatt, who piloted the measure, informed the House that the "biggest thing" is that "we have taken a decision to add a sunset clause in this (bill)". A sunset clause gives an expiry date to a law. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said he wants to assure the House that after the parliamentary nod and presidential assent, the Act will become effective only when it is invoked. It may so happen that there is no need to invoke this Act, he said, adding that the law "will be effective for only a year". The Essential Defence Services Bill, 2021 seeks to replace an ordinance issued in June. As the minister was speaking, opposition members continued their protests over Pegasus snooping row and farmers' issues. N K Premachandran (RSP) was of the view that such an important Bill should not be passed amid the din. Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury termed the bill as "draconian" and said that it should not be passed when the House is "not in order". TMC's Saugata Roy alleged the measure is "anti-labour". The defence minister said the Bill has been brought keeping in mind the security of the nation and the importance of the legislation should be understood. "Keeping in mind national security, I request you to pass this Bill," he told the Lower House. MoS Defence Bhatt said there was no intention to harm the interests of government employees. He said discussions have been held with the employees' organisations in a cordial atmosphere. The bill was later passed by a voice vote amid continuous uproar by opposition members. According to the Statements of Objects and Reasons of the Bill, Indian Ordnance Factories is the oldest and largest industrial set up which functions under the Department of Defence Production of the Ministry of Defence. The ordnance factories form an integrated base for indigenous production of defence hardware and equipment, with the primary objective of self-reliance in equipping the armed forces with state-of-the-art battlefield equipment. In order to improve autonomy, accountability and efficiency in ordnance supplies, the Government decided to convert the Ordnance Factory Board into one or more one hundred percent government-owned corporate entity or entities to be registered under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. Against the decision, the recognised federations of the employees gave a notice for an indefinite strike. The conciliation proceedings initiated by the government at the level of Chief Labour Commissioner failed in the meeting held on June 15. On June 16, the government decided to convert the Ordnance Factory Board into seven Defence Public Sector Undertakings. "In spite of the government's assurance to take care of the conditions of service of the employees of the Ordnance Factory Board, the recognised federations of the employees have reiterated their intention to go on an indefinite strike from July 26. "Since, it is essential that an uninterrupted supply of ordnance items to the armed forces be maintained for the defence preparedness of the country and the ordnance factories continue to function without any disruptions, especially in view of the prevailing situation on the northern front of the country, it was felt necessary that the government should have power to meet the emergency created by such attempts," it said It said the government had to ensure the maintenance of essential defence services in all establishments connected with defence, in public interest or interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India or security of any State or decency or morality. The Statement of Objects said the ordinance issued on June 30 defines the expressions "essential defence services" and "strike". It also empowers the central government to prohibit a strike in essential defence services and provides for disciplinary action, including dismissal, against employees participating in such a strike. It also provides for penalties for "illegal strikes, instigation thereof and providing for financial aid to such illegal strikes."||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-360

"Over the years, food storage kept increasing, but starvation and malnutrition did not decrease in that ratio," Modi said, after a virtual interaction with the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PM-GKAY) beneficiaries in Gujarat. "The PM-GKAY food security scheme is helping lakhs of poor people during the coronavirus pandemic," Modi said. "Free ration is being distributed to lakhs of families under the scheme and it has helped lessen the worries of poor during the pandemic," he said. Modi said the government used new technology to make the food grain delivery system to the poor more effective. "After independence, almost every government had talked about providing cheap food to the poor. The scope and budget of cheap ration schemes increased year after year, but the effect it should have had remained limited. The country's food reserves increased, but hunger and malnutrition did not decrease in that proportion," he said. "Some sickness came into the system, some selfish elements entered. To change this situation, after 2014, work started in a new way, and help of new technology was taken to remove crores of fake beneficiaries and link ration cards with Aadhaar card and encourage digital technology in government fair price shops," he said. Modi said empowerment of the poor is a top priority of his government. "Today, the country is spending lakhs of crores on infrastructure, but at the same time, it is also setting new benchmarks to improve the quality of life of the common man, he said. The government is making efforts to provide all possible help to citizens during the pandemic, he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-360

Notice on the PIL, which also seeks a helpline for registration of such cases, was issued by a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh. The petitioner is an 84-year-old Dhiraj Aggarwal who suffers from arthritis and is yet to be vaccinated as she cannot visit the vaccination centre on account of her health. The petition also highlights that many fellow super senior and bed-ridden citizens, who are vulnerable to COVID-19, do not have private transport to reach the vaccination centre or even a family member who would help them with the registration process. Visiting a vaccination centre also exposes senior citizens to the virus, it added. The petitioner, represented by advocate Vinay Kumar, argued that it is the obligation of the authorities to introduce helpline and door-to-door vaccination and not doing so is against the right to life. It is the obligatory duty of the respondent no. 1 and 2 (Centre and Delhi government) to take care of super senior and bed ridden citizens, it said, adding that denying the vaccine by not introducing a helpline number for registration of COVID-19 vaccine and a policy on urgent basis for door to door COVID-19 vaccination for super senior and bed ridden citizens in Delhi is against the fundamental right to life of a citizen. The petition said that certain states like Jharkhand have already begun door-to-door campaign for vaccination. The matter would be heard next on September 16.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-361

Briefing reporters on Modi's speech at the BJP parliamentary party meeting, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said the prime minister expressed anger at the conduct of some opposition members and noted that those who tore papers and threw it around have remained unrepentant. This shows their arrogance, Modi said and asked his party members to maintain restraint. While a TMC member in Rajya Sabha had torn the statement of IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on the Pegasus issue, several opposition members had torn papers in Lok Sabha and threw it in the air and towards the Chair. A tweet of TMC leader Derek O'Brien criticising the manner of bills' passage in Parliament also drew Modi's ire, Joshi and another Union minister V Muraleedharan told reporters, without naming the TMC member. He had tweeted, "In the first 10 days, Modi-Shah rushed through and passed 12 Bills at an average time of UNDER SEVEN MINUTES per Bill. Passing legislation or making papri chaat!" Such comments are "derogatory" to the parliamentary procedure and the esteem of elected representatives, Muraleedharan said quoting Modi. The conduct of the opposition is an "insult" to Parliament and the Constitution, Joshi said, quoting the prime minister. Modi accused them of having "undemocratic" attitude and said they are not keen on meaningful debates. The opposition has stalled Parliament's proceedings demanding a discussion on the Pegasus snooping row, an issue dismissed as inconsequential by the government. In the meeting, Modi asserted that his government will leave no stone unturned to fulfil its commitment to people. Bills do not belong to the government but are aimed at people's welfare, he added. The prime minister, Joshi said, reiterated the government's stand for constructive and rich debates. The BJP parliamentary party also hailed Modi at the meeting over the government's decision to provide reservation to the OBC and the EWS in the all-India quota in the medical entrance test NEET. The prime minister also highlighted the rise in the GST revenue in the month of July with a collection of 1.16 lakh crore to express confidence about the state of economy. Finance Minister Nirmala Sithraman also spoke in detail about the economic conditions and asserted that the recovery has gathered pace despite the second wave. India's foreign reserves are at an all-time high while the GST collection also rose significantly last month, she added. The government's package for the MSME sector is now at Rs 4.5 lakh crore while the banking sector has also made recovery and posted profit of over Rs 31,000 crore, sources quoting her said. Economic indicators have been doing well, she said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-361

There were "murmurs" that Kumar was scared of the two tenants living in a house he owned and he "nursed a deep grudge" about the loss of respect in the eyes of his students, it said. Kumar and his associates allegedly assaulted 23-year-old wrestler Sagar Dhankar, his friend Sonu and three others at the stadium on the intervening night of May 4 and 5 over a property dispute. Later, Sagar succumbed to his injuries. "The present incident is the result of a criminal conspiracy hatched by accused Sushil Kumar along with his associates to take revenge from Sonu and Sagar," the police said in its over 1,000-page charge sheet filed on Monday. The Crime Branch, which is tasked with investigating the case, said Kumar wanted to teach a lesson to Sagar and Sonu and re-establish his supremacy in the stadium through muscle power. It also listed reasons why Kumar and his associates took revenge. The police investigation established that it was due to the initial reluctance shown by Sagar and Sonu to vacate Kumar's flat and "murmurs" in the stadium that the Olympic wrestler was scared of the duo and couldn't withstand them. Another reason, according to the police, was that Kumar had a strong suspicion that wrestlers training under him were passing information about his movements to Sagar and Sonu and the latter could harm him as he had an extensive criminal background. "When he realised that some of his own trainees were passing information about him to Sonu and Sagar, he felt betrayed and thus nursed a deep grudge against Sonu and Sagar for loss of respect in the eyes of his students," the charge sheet stated. Notorious criminal Kala Jathedi, who was recently arrested, told the police that Kumar's ego was hurt after Sagar and Sonu refused to vacate his flat because of which he felt a loss of respect. The charge sheet names 13 accused, including Kumar, who is named as the main accused. The police said they relied on the oral dying declaration of Dhankar, scientific evidence including locations of the accused, CCTV footage, weapons and vehicles recovered from the spot. "From the material collected during the investigation so far precisely mentioned above, there is sufficient material against the accused persons," it stated, seeking their prosecution under 22 offences of the Indian Penal Code. The charge sheet mentions the names of 155 prosecution witnesses, including four persons who were injured during the brawl. The Delhi Police had filed the FIR against the accused for offences such as murder, attempt to murder, culpable homicide, criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, robbery and rioting, among others.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-362

The invite has gone out to every Opposition MP instead of only the floor leaders, the first of its kind. Rahul’s initiative seems to have pleased Opposition leaders, who are keen on a unified fight against the government, and also reignited the leadership debate in the Congress and underlined the need for the former party president to have a defined role. While the farmers’ agitation had prepared the ground for unity of purpose among the Opposition parties, the Pegasus controversy has stoked the urge for a united offensive. The government is on the defensive and its stubborn refusal to allow a debate on the snooping allegations has deepened suspicions. At Tuesday’s meeting, the parties may announce a political programme that could include the conduct of a mock Parliament outside the House to send out a message to the people. A leader of an Opposition party said: “We are happy that Rahul has taken this initiative after attending an Opposition meeting in this session. It would have been better if he had called all the MPs to his residence, not the Constitution Club. “By calling all of us to his house, he could have sent out a deeper message with a personal touch. But a beginning has been made, and we hope he extends his outreach to the friendly parties in the coming days. There’s a feeling among Opposition leaders that Rahul should step up his involvement.” Rahul, who had largely avoided the task of coalition-building in the past, has now begun interacting with Opposition leaders and left a positive impression. After attending the Opposition meeting held a few days ago, he tweeted: “Sitting with the entire Opposition is extremely humbling. Amazing experience, wisdom and insight in everyone present.” With this one gesture of humility, followed by the invitations to Tuesday’s breakfast meeting, Rahul appears to have broken down several imaginary barriers and perceptions about his personality. Asked why Rahul and not Sonia Gandhi, the chairperson of the Congress Party in Parliament (CPP), had called the meeting, a senior Congress politician said: “This ad-hocism highlights the need for a system to be put in place. Sonia Gandhi was elected CPP chairperson when Rahul was Congress president. Now Sonia is party president and Rahul has no official status to call such meetings. He should become CPP chairperson if there is no immediate plan to return as party chief.” A Congress general secretary, however, told The Telegraph: “The process of electing the new party president has been delayed by Covid, but parliamentary responsibilities cannot be put off. It is good that Rahul has come forward to do the job. “The impression we get is that he is willing to return (as party president) — and there’s no alternative, either. Ask any Opposition leader who is the most potent force against Narendra Modi, and you’ll get the answer.” Congress insiders are hoping the leadership crisis would now end without too long a wait.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-362
03-08-2021||India||Pegasus: Paranjoy Guha Thakurta moves SC against spyware scandal||Veteran journalist Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, whose phone was among those infected with the Pegasus spyware, on Monday moved the Supreme Court, saying the snooping “will stop confidential informants and whistleblowers from coming forward and bringing to light wrongdoing at various levels of government”. Guha Thakurta, a former member of the Press Council of India, urged the apex court to declare the action as “unconstitutional” and direct the Centre to set up a “judicial oversight” mechanism to prevent such breach of citizens’ privacy. In his petition, Guha has said the illegal surveillance would have a chilling effect on the right to free speech in India. “Further, the petitioner apprehends that the Pegasus attack on him and other journalists in India will stop confidential informants and whistleblowers from coming forward and bringing to light wrongdoing at various levels of government and as such, have a detrimental effect on transparency in governance all across India. “The present petition raises tremendously important questions of constitutional interpretation, particularly with respect to the extent of the right to privacy the due process of law pertaining” its deprivation. The petition added: “These questions are so urgent and fundamental in nature and have such a profound effect on the lives of all the citizens of India that the petitioner is of the view that it is only proper to take the extreme step of approaching this Hon’ble Court directly under Article 32 (enforcement of fundamental right) jurisdiction.” Guha Thakurta is the first “aggrieved person”, whose personal phone was kept under surveillance, to move the top court on the Pegasus controversy. Rupesh Kumar Singh, a freelance journalist based in Jharkhand, has also approached the court with a plea to declare the spyware illegal. The phone number of Rupesh, who had reported on violence on Adivasis by security forces and who was jailed on alleged trumped-up charges,  and that of his two family members figure in the leaked list of potential targets of surveillance. An advocate, two journalists and an MP have already moved the court on the snooping operation. These three  petitions have been listed for hearing on Thursday before a bench of Chief Justice N.V. Ramana and Justice Surya Kant. Guha Thakurta, in his petition filed through advocate Prateek K. Chadha, has sought the following directives: ⚫ Declare the installation and/or use of malware or spyware such as Pegasus as illegal and unconstitutional. ⚫ Issue a directive to the Centre to produce and disclose all materials and documents on the investigation, authorisation and orders on the use of Pegasus on the petitioner. ⚫ Direct the Union government to take suitable steps to protect Indian citizens from the use of cyber weapons/malware such as Pegasus. ⚫ Direct the Centre to put in place a judicial oversight mechanism to deal with any complaints on illegal breaches of privacy and hacking and punish all government officials responsible for such breaches. The petition said that between 2017 and 2019, about 50,000 phone numbers across the world were targeted by the malware. “The list of these numbers comprised 300 verified Indian numbers which had been targeted by the Pegasus malware, of which one belongs to the petitioner herein. The Pegasus Project assisted the supposed targets to discern the presence of the malware on their phones. “The petitioner being a senior journalist, was provided with aid in this regard. Amnesty International’s Security Lab examined his mobile device and found forensic traces of the malware operating on his phone, which confirmed the surveillance,” the petition said. The petitioner noted that despite the raging controversy over Pegasus,  the Centre so far has not categorically stated whether it had deployed the malware to carry out the  hacking and surveillance. “The respondent authorities also failed to unequivocally deny the fact that they had purchased/obtained the Pegasus malware from NSO and/or the state of Israel. “The petitioner, therefore, has strong reasons to believe that he has been subjected  to a deeply intrusive surveillance and hacking by the Government of India or some other third party. Consequently, he perceives that his rights to privacy, the access to information and his freedom as a journalist have been violated,” the petition said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-362
03-08-2021||India||Vaccine: Government misses July target by 20 million doses||The Centre had till August 2 provided around 497 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to the states, nearly 20 million short of the 516 million doses it had said it expected to supply by July 31. The Union health ministry said on Monday that the Centre had sent the states more than 496.4 million doses and that 984,610 doses were in the pipeline. The inoculation campaign had till Monday administered over 477 million doses. In a June 26 affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court, the ministry had said 516 million doses “will be available” by July 31. But some health experts had in mid-July expressed doubts whether the Centre would be able to meet that target. On July 27, the ministry had asserted that more than 516 million doses would “indeed” be supplied by July 31. In a media release, it had said that 457 million doses “have been supplied” to states and an additional 60.3 million doses “are expected to be supplied by July 31”. This would amount to 517 million doses supplied from January 2021 till July 31. But the ministry’s release on Monday said that 496,498,050 doses had been provided to the states so far and a further 984,610 doses were in the pipeline. The health ministry did not respond to a query from this newspaper on the reasons for the gap between the 517 million doses it had last week expected to supply by July 31 and the 497 million doses provided till August 2. Experts say the shortfall, although less than 4 per cent of the projected 517 million doses, suggests the ministry was unable to access or provide some of the additional 60.3 million doses it had expected to supply six days ago. “The government should stop releasing aspirational projections and, instead, say how many doses would be available for actual administration,” said R. Ramakumar, professor of developmental studies at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai. Ramakumar and other experts believe the aspirational projections were likely aimed at what Ramakumar described as “seeking temporary reprieves” from criticism of the vaccination campaign whose pace has been hampered by the limited flow of doses, among other reasons. Vaccine experts and industry executives had earlier this year predicted dose shortages, underlining the government’s failure to invest early enough to secure large volumes of doses the way other countries had. India had by Monday fully vaccinated over 105 million people, or about 11 per cent of the eligible adult population of 944 million. The campaign administered over 5.3 million doses on Monday, but will need to administer over 9 million doses daily through the rest of the year to fully vaccinate the eligible population by December 31.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-362
03-08-2021||India||Citizens reject Centre’s 'Muslim Women’s Rights Day'||Over 600 citizens from all walks of life on Monday rejected the Centre’s declaration of August 1 as “Muslim Women’s Rights Day” to mark the second anniversary of the enactment of the  triple talaq law. They billed it cynical optics “by a government bent on reducing all Muslims to second-class citizens”. Union minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi had announced on Saturday that August 1 would be observed as “Muslim Women’s Rights Day” and the event on Sunday saw several senior ministers of the Narendra Modi government, including Smriti Irani and Bhupinder Yadav, in attendance. In a statement directly addressed to Naqvi, the citizens questioning the move said: “We reject the government’s cynical optics, we reject ‘your’ Muslim Women’s Rights Day. And we say, respectfully, ‘How dare you!’” The statement is signed by Muslim and non-Muslim women, men and transpersons across castes and regions. The signatories include former Planning Commission member Syeda Hameed, transparency activist Aruna Roy, Annie Raja of the National Federation of Indian Women, AIDWA vice-president Subhashini Ali, Kavita Srivastava of the PUCL, Nivedita Menon and Vikas Rawal of JNU, sociologist Nandini Sundar and theatre artist Maya Krishna Rao. The statement seeks to highlight the Modi government's forked-tongue policy on Muslims, listing the various efforts that have been made under its watch to marginalise the country’s largest minority group. Referring to the Modi government's decision to enact the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens, along with its silence on atrocities on the community, they said: “Such a government has no moral right to declare any national day in the name of Muslim women.” Explaining their reason for rejecting the move, the statement said: “This government that has worked to ceaselessly one by one, decimate the constitutional rights of Muslims in India, now has the temerity to declare Muslim Women's Rights Day on August 1. This, to celebrate its passage of its purportedly Anti-Triple Talaq law (Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019), that claimed to protect Muslim women's rights, but in reality, had a more sinister purpose -- to show Muslim men their place in a new India. To tell them that they can be criminalised even in civil matters. The Triple Talaq law was an abomination. It was then, and still is, nothing but a charade.” The statement echoes the position many of the signatories had taken when the government tried to navigate the triple talaq bill through Parliament during its first term when it did not have adequate numbers in the Rajya Sabha. It finally cleared Parliament in 2019 soon after the BJP returned to power with a larger mandate. The statement recalls what many of the signatories had said back then. “You cannot pretend to save Muslim women while seeking to bring the Muslim community to its knees. The sentiment is as true today as it was then.” This government, they underscored, has diluted Muslims' rights to citizenship by enacting the discriminatory CAA. “The very Muslim women, in whose name you have declared August 1 as a day of ‘their rights’, invited their government, even begged their government, to talk to them when they were out on the streets, protesting the CAA-NPR-NRC, in a desperate bid to save their future, their children's future, their family's future, in their own country. You responded to those Muslim women with the utter contempt of silence. Without even the pretence of democratic dialogue.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-362
03-08-2021||India||Pegasus: Centre stalls Opposition pleas to discuss snooping scandal||The government on Monday continued to stall the Opposition’s relentless pleas in Parliament to discuss the Pegasus snooping allegations and passed bills amid the din by voice vote, drawing accusations of “riding roughshod over the House”. “Sabhapati mahoday, hum charcha chahte hain, hum charcha chahte hain, charcha chahte hain (Sir, we want a discussion, we want a discussion, we want a discussion),” Congress House leader Adhir Chowdhury shouted during the afternoon session in the Lok Sabha. “We want to discuss Pegasus first and then other issues,” he managed to add before his mike was switched off. Adhir’s plea had come as he rose to protest finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s act of introducing a bill amid the chaos. He accused the government of “riding roughshod over the House” by pushing bills through without discussion. Sitharaman had withdrawn the tribunals reforms bill and introduced an amended one in its place. Adhir’s mike was muted because the presiding officer was not ready to allow him to speak on any subject other than his notice opposing the introduction and passage of bills. Monday marked the start of the third week and the 10th day of the monsoon session of Parliament, which concludes on August 13. From day one the Opposition had begun demanding discussions on the Pegasus controversy, farmers’ agitation, Covid, price rise and some other issues. Since last week, however, the Opposition has focused on demanding a discussion on Pegasus first and then the other issues. The government has termed Pegasus a “non-issue” and said it was ready to discuss other issues. As in other days, Opposition members trooped to the Well of the House on Monday, waved placards and chanted slogans demanding a discussion on, and a probe into, the allegations about the government snooping on judges, politicians, journalists, activists and others using Israeli spyware. Speaker Om Birla conducted Question Hour for over half an hour amid the protests and then adjourned the House till noon. In the afternoon, the House was adjourned again after Sitharaman withdrew a bill and introduced another. When the House met again, the finance minister was ready to get the General Insurance Business (Amendment) Bill passed. Adhir again opposed the bill, terming it “anti-people” and “anti-national” and accused the government of intending to sell public-sector insurance companies to private buyers. Sitharaman called the charge “misleading” and said she would have replied in detail had the Opposition allowed a discussion. The bill was passed by voice vote in less than 10 minutes and the House was adjourned for the day. The Rajya Sabha witnessed similar chaos, with the Opposition demanding a discussion on the Pegasus controversy under Rule 267 and the government passing the Inland Vessels Bill. Chairman Venkaiah Naidu warned that he would name the MPs waving placards in the official record of proceedings – seen as a reprimand. “What I’m saying is that I’m ready, I’m ready to discuss. Even the business advisory committee has decided to hear about farmers’ problems and also other problems, provided the House is in order,” Naidu said before adjourning the House.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-362

The scientists at the National Institute of Virology, Pune, have found that while immune responses in the three groups of people show reductions in activity against Delta, Delta-plus, and a third variant, B.1.617.3, they remain sufficiently strong to neutralise all three variants. “All three sets of people have enough (immune) responses to neutralise each of the three variants,” Pragya Yadav, who led the study, said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-362
03-08-2021||India||India-China: Veterans demand disclosure of disengagement plan||A joint statement released by the defence ministry on Saturday’s India-China military talks hides more than it reveals, veterans said, demanding the government disclose the disengagement plan discussed and asking whether it had given up the demand for restoration of status quo on the frontier. Monday’s brief statement, coming almost 44 hours after the 12th round of corps-commander-level talks ended, spoke of “in-depth exchange of views”, “enhanced mutual understanding” and “ensuring stability” along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). But it followed the example of the past several such statements in maintaining silence on any restoration of status quo along the LAC to pre-standoff (April 2020) positions, which India had once insisted was a precondition for bilateral ties returning to normal. “Does it mean that India has accepted the new status quo and given up the (demand for) restoration of status quo ante?” a retired colonel said. A retired lieutenant general said: “According to estimates, the Chinese army has taken over close to 1,000sqkm of India-claimed territory since May last year. It’s such a grave issue concerning India’s territorial sovereignty, but our government is busy hiding more than revealing anything on this.” Sources in the security establishment said the talks had remained inconclusive with the Chinese continuing to resist the Indian demand for disengagement and troop de-escalation from the remaining friction points: Hot Springs, Gogra and the Depsang Plains. There have been “partial” disengagements from the Galwan Valley and the Pangong Lake, with the Chinese stepping back a few kilometres while still remaining within India-claimed lines, and India retreating by the same distance — thus ceding more territory. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday again accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of ceding territory to China. “Mr Modi and his minions have ceded thousands of km of Indian land to China. When exactly are we getting it back?” he tweeted. On June 19 last year, four days after a clash in the Galwan Valley had killed 20 Indian soldiers, Modi had said that no one had entered Indian territory or occupied Indian posts, prompting Beijing to immediately claim ownership of all the areas it held. The joint statement said: “The two sides had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on resolution of remaining areas related to disengagement.... They agreed to resolve these remaining issues in an expeditious manner in accordance with the existing agreements and protocols and maintain the momentum of dialogue and negotiations.” It said the two sides had noted that the meeting had been “constructive” and “further enhanced mutual understanding”. “The two sides also agreed that in the interim they will continue their effective efforts in ensuring stability along the LAC... and jointly maintain peace and tranquillity.” The security establishment fears the Chinese are working to establish a “revised status quo” that will allow them to hold on to their newly acquired positions within India-claimed lines. The retired lieutenant general who spoke to this newspaper said the government “should come clean on the specifics of the purported disengagement plan being discussed with the Chinese”. China’s hardened stand has triggered apprehensions that the Ladakh frontier could now become a permanently contested militarised zone, similar to Jammu and Kashmir. Sources said 25 rounds of military and diplomatic talks had taken place since May last year but nothing much had changed on the ground. Both sides have amassed men and machinery at altitudes of 14,000ft and above, and have deployed 50,000 troops each along the LAC in Ladakh backed by artillery, tanks and missile systems.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-363
03-08-2021||India|| Lakshadweep govt to go ahead with controversial tourism plans ||The Lakshadweep administration is going ahead with its controversial tourism plans for the ecologically fragile archipelago, ignoring warnings from scientists that a Maldives-style development would spell environmental disaster. Social activists from the Union Territory are planning to petition Kerala High Court against the projects, Lakshadweep district panchayat member Asif Ali of the Nationalist Congress Party told The Telegraph on Monday. On July 31, the administration invited international bids by September 2 for the construction of 370 villas — 125 of them on water — as part of eco-tourism projects on the Minicoy, Kadmat and Suheli islands. The total budget for the projects is Rs 806 crore. “We are going to court since these projects will destroy our islands. Moneybags eyeing our land will not have any commitment to, or concern for, the well-being of the local people or these ecologically fragile islands,” Ali said. Sixty scientists, most of them marine biologists, had in June written to President Ram Nath Kovind seeking his help in protecting the islands, which are already facing severe sea erosion and a depletion of shoreline, against the plans for large-scale construction. “If they are going to build tourist resorts, we can expect some serious damage to the entire ecological system in and around Lakshadweep,” said a marine biologist and a signatory to the letter who declined to be named since he works for a government institute. He said a few years ago the administration had built embarkation jetties on the Kavaratti, Agatti, Minicoy and Amini islands. “They drilled the floor to construct pillars for the jetties, thereby destroying coral reefs and all life forms in those areas,” the scientist said. The Supreme Court-appointed Justice R.V. Raveendran Commission had in its 2014 report, which has since been made binding, said all island projects must adhere to the norms of the Integrated Island Management Plan. “It is highly essential to protect corals, sea grass and other ecosystems from anthropogenic activities like waste disposal, port development and associated activities like dredging of navigational channels and construction of breakwaters, tourism and related activities, sand mining, intensive fishing etc,” the report says. Currently, only the tiny, tear-drop-shaped Bangaram Island is dedicated to tourism in Lakshadweep, an archipelago of 36 islands of which just 10 are inhabited. Bangaram is uninhabited apart from the resorts. The Rs 319-crore Minicoy project is to cover an area of 8.53 hectares and have 110 beach villas and 40 water villas, to be built on the lagoon. The Rs 240-crore Kadmat project will cover 5.55 hectares and have 75 beach villas and 35 water villas. The Rs 247-crore project on the uninhabited Suheli Island will come up on 3.82 hectares and have 60 beach villas and 50 water villas. Lakshadweep district collector A. Asker Ali issued the tender notice that seeks bids to “undertake development, operation and maintenance” through “design, build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT) on public-private partnership basis”. The projects are among several controversial decisions that Lakshadweep administrator Praful Khoda Patel has taken without consulting the local bodies or the Union Territory’s lone Lok Sabha member. Patel, an RSS man who was Gujarat home minister for a while when Narendra Modi was chief minister, has been accused of pushing a saffron agenda in Muslim-majority Lakshadweep whose residents are classified as Scheduled Tribes. Over the past few months, the non-BJP parties from the archipelago have sent a mass petition to President Kovind seeking Patel’s recall, while several MPs from Kerala have sent similar letters to the President and the Prime Minister.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-363
03-08-2021||India||SC issues notices on continued use of Section 66A of IT Act||The Supreme Court on Monday issued notices to states, Union Territories and registrars-general of high courts, seeking an explanation for the continued use of Section 66A of the Information Technology Act although it had been declared unconstitutional in 2015. While seeking a response from the authorities concerned within four weeks, a bench of Justices R.F. Nariman and B.R. Gavai told senior advocate Sanjay Parekh, appearing for the petitioner Peoples Union for Civil Liberties, that it was necessary to implead the states and Union Territories as law and order fell under their respective domains. At the last hearing on July 1, the top court had expressed “shock” and “amazement” at the manner in which people were still being booked under Section 66A of the IT Act for voicing their opinions on the Internet. “It’s amazing and shocking. That’s what I can say. Shreya Singhal is a 2015 judgment. What is going on in the country is terrible,” Justice Nariman had observed. Attorney-general K.K. Venugopal, on behalf of the Union government, had at that time accepted the court’s notice and sought two weeks to file the Centre’s counter-affidavit. However, the Centre is yet to file its response. On Monday, when the matter came up for hearing, the bench underscored the need to make the states/UTs and high court registrars respondents in the matter because apart from the executive, several courts in the country continued to entertain complaints under Section 66A of the IT Act. In its petition filed through advocate Aparna Bhat, PUCL has urged the apex court to direct the Centre to collect all data regarding FIRs or investigations where Section 66A had been invoked as well as pendency of cases in courts across the country. At the last hearing, Venugopal had admitted that Section 66A was still there in most of the law books despite being struck down by the apex court. “When police has to register a case, the section is still there and only has a footnote that the SC has struck it down. There has to be a bracket in 66A with words struck down,” the country’s highest law officer said. According to PUCL, the Supreme Court had in a subsequent order on February 15, 2019, directed the states and Union Territories to desist from invoking Section 66A, but the police continue to file cases under the provision. “…the applicant discovered that Section 66A of the IT Act has continued to be in use not only within police stations but also in cases before trial courts across India,” the PUCL stated.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-363

Academics said this was not surprising because training under the Short-Term Training programme of the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikash Yojana was superficial, short and often at odds with the industry’s demands. Skill development minister Dharmendra Pradhan has informed the Lok Sabha that 65.95 lakh candidates had enrolled under the programme, of whom 52.46 lakh got certified and 23.25 lakh received placements. This means only 44.3 per cent of those certified got jobs. Under the programme, private centres called “vocational training providers” (VTPs) train the youths with funds from the skill development ministry. The last 20 per cent of the tranche of funds is released only if 70 per cent of those certified by a VTP get placements. The government has been running the Yojana since 2015. It provided Rs 8,000 per trainee to the VTPs in 2015 and 2016, the sum rising to Rs 15,195 in the second phase (2016 to 2020) and to Rs 22,770 under the third phase that began a year ago. The government spent an estimated Rs 5,903 crore on the scheme till 2020, with Rs 5,278 crore of it spent in the three financial years: 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20. Under the programme, a youth has to undergo 150 to 300 hours of training, depending on the vocation. Labour economist Santosh Mehrotra said the placement rate was poor because the training did not meet industry’s expectations. He said most of the trainees lack education beyond Class X or Class XII and therefore have no “solid foundational knowledge on any subject”. “The three to four months’ skill training given to them fails to equip them with the confidence to handle any job. That’s why formal industry is reluctant to recruit them,” Mehrotra said. He said the unorganised sector mainly provided placements against low salaries that often failed to meet the recruits’ living expenses and forced them to drop out. According to the government, the average monthly salary for the scheme’s certificate holders has been Rs 8,500. Economist Sunil Ray, former director of the A.N. Sinha Institute of Social Studies, Patna, said the scheme was “not economically sustainable”. “Compared with the expenditure, the benefit in terms of training and placement is low.... This scheme has become a white elephant,” Ray said. He said the main problem was that the government had not done a thorough mapping of the skills required in the different regions of the country. “The government decided the skill sets from its end.... First, it should do a skill mapping (to identify) those skills that are required,” Ray said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-363
03-08-2021||India||Ladakh: Buddhist & Muslim leaders unitedly demand full statehood||The Centre’s efforts to mollify Ladakh appear to have boomeranged with the region’s Buddhist and Muslim leaderships joining hands to demand full statehood for the Union Territory and special status like that enjoyed by the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. “It is a historic decision. For the first time and despite so many differences, the entire Ladakh leadership has come together and there was a consensus on four issues,” Asgar Karbalai, a leader of the Kargil Democratic Alliance, told reporters in Ladakh during a joint news conference with Leh’s apex body People’s Movement. Topping the list is the demand for full statehood to Ladakh and exclusive rights over land and jobs for the Ladakhis similar to those guaranteed under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution or Article 371. Ladakh’s Buddhist population, a majority of whom live in Leh, had supported the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, and the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir. Ladakh’s Muslims, who live mostly in Kargil, had bitterly opposed the August 5 decision and were fighting for the restoration of the erstwhile state and Article 370. With the BJP-led government giving no indication of giving in to their demands, it was a win-win situation for the Centre as the two communities were busy fighting each other. However, the two communities have now not only forged a rare unity, but also sought more powers than those enjoyed by the erstwhile state. “After lot of deliberations, there was a consensus on four points. Ladakhis faced lot of difficulties after the August 5, 2019, re-organisation when the state was divided into two Union Territories. People of Ladakh felt that issues confronting them can only be resolved by granting full-fledged statehood to Ladakh,” Karbalai said. The two communities have now forged a rare unity. Their joint leadership rejected the domicile laws extended to Jammu and Kashmir, seeking exclusive rights over land and jobs. Outsiders are free to buy land in Jammu and Kashmir while a section of them can also avail government jobs. Additionally, the Ladakh leadership has sought two Lok Sabha and two Rajya Sabha seats for the region. Ladakh, which was home to just two per cent population of the erstwhile state, currently has one Lok Sabha and no Rajya Sabha seat. Jammu and Kashmir has five Lok Sabha and four Rajya Sabha seats. The leaders demanded that 10,000-12,000 job vacancies should be filled within a month by only Ladakhi youths. Former Ladakh MP Thupstan Chhewang, who heads the Leh alliance, said statehood for Ladakh was a long-term goal, adding that that they would agitate if the process to recruit Ladakhis was not started within a month. Karbalai said all future negotiations with the Centre would revolve around these four issues. The joint demand for statehood has come two months after the Kargil leadership held maiden talks with the Centre and sought full statehood for Ladakh. They seem to have succeeded in getting Leh on board. Sources in the Kargil alliance said they had not given up on their demand for the reversal of the August 5 decisions. “We have filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the August 5 decisions. The erstwhile state will become a reality only when those decisions are reversed,” a leader said. In May, the Centre had reached out to the Jammu and Kashmir leadership where major parties, including the National Conference and People’s Democratic Party, told Prime Minister Narendra Modi to restore Articles 370 and 35A. There was no follow-up after that.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-363
03-08-2021||India||Tokyo Olympics: Indian hockey benefits from support of Odisha ||Indian hockey is reaping the benefits of the support that the Odisha government has provided after both the men’s and women’s national teams entered the semi-finals of the Tokyo Olympics. The Odisha government is the official sponsor of both the men’s and women’s hockey teams since 2018 and is contracted to sponsor it till 2023. The government is committed to spend Rs 100 crore for sponsoring Indian hockey, sources said. Considered to be one of the cradles of hockey in India, Odisha has been putting in all efforts to ensure that the country regains its rightful position in the game in the world, they said. The state had shot into international focus when it successfully organised the Men’s Hockey World Cup in Bhubaneswar in 2018 and is going to host the event again in 2023. Two players from Odisha — Birendra Lakra and Amit Rohidas — are part of the men’s hockey team in Tokyo. Amit’s mother Golapi Rohidas told The Telegraph: “My husband passed away last year due to kidney failure. He had a dream that our son should play in the Olympics and win a medal. I hope Amit fulfils his dream. I watched the match along with my elder son Niranjan.” Residents of Amit’s village Saunamara in Sundargarh district were also elated. “The transformer supplying power to our village got burnt. With the help of a battery, we watched the game on TV. With only four minutes left, the battery conked out but we managed to watch the rest of the game on our mobile phones. It’s a great moment for our village as our boy is a part of the Indian hockey team,” said former sarpanch Chulu Barla. Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik watched the match on Sunday as the Indian men’s team beat Great Britain 3-1 to enter the semi-finals. On Monday, the women’s team beat much-fancied Australia 1-0 to reach the semi-finals. Congratulating the men’s team, Naveen said: “The national team has come out with flying colours in the quarter-final.” He expressed hope that the team will keep up the momentum to win the semi-final and the Olympic final. Congratulating the women’s hockey team, Naveen said: “What a terrific game our women’s hockey team played against Australia. Keep it up.” Odisha finance secretary Vishal Kumar Dev, who was earlier the sports secretary, told this newspaper: “On the direction of the chief minister, we have been focusing on promoting hockey in our state as well as in the country. Odisha was successful in organising the Men’s Hockey World Cup in 2018. The next Men’s Hockey World Cup will be held in Odisha in 2023. We are putting all our efforts to ensure its success as well. We have got recognition from the FIH (International Hockey Federation) for our efforts to popularise the game and supporting the cause of Indian hockey.” The world cup will be held in two places — Bhubaneswar and Rourkela. Former Indian men’s hockey captain Dilip Tirkey told this newspaper: “With the Odisha government sponsoring hockey for the last three years, the fruits are now visible. We have built a world-class hockey facility at Kalinga Stadium and another stadium is coming up in Rourkela. Without official patronage, hockey could not have reached this stage.” The hockey stadium in Rourkela is being built with an investment of Rs 100 crore. Indian Olympic Association president N.D. Batra tweeted: “Hon’ble chief minister of Odisha Naveen Patnaik Ji sending his congratulatory message by video to Team India men’s hockey team for winning the quarter-finals and entering into semi-finals after a gap of 41 years and chief minister also wished good luck to the men’s hockey team for semi-finals on 3rd August. Thank You chief minister Sir on behalf of Indian men’s hockey team in Tokyo.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-363
03-08-2021||India||Flood situation grim in south Bihar||Several districts in south Bihar have been affected by floods as small and big rivers flowing in the state swelled following heavy rainfall in Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh. The deluge has affected parts of Patna, Jehanabad, Nalanda, Gaya, Aurangabad and Rohtas districts. Floodwaters are causing damage of crops and household belongings. Embankments and roads have also been damaged at several places. “What we are seeing is the outcome of very heavy rains in Jharkhand on July 30 and 31. It led to much water flowing into the rivers in the southern parts of Bihar. Around 74,000 cusecs were released from the Uderasthan barrage into the Falgu river on Saturday night, topping its highest flood level by around 70cm. The water has spilled over and spread to parts of Nalanda and Patna districts,” chief engineer (flood control and drainage), water resources, Shailendra, told The Telegraph. Similarly, the water of the Punpun and Morhar rivers spilled over their embankments around Masaurhi in Patna on Sunday night. “Water is still spreading in parts of Patna district. We are trying to contain the deluge. The destruction due to floods is widespread,” Shailendra added. Panic prevailed as floodwaters spread across four blocks of Patna district — Dhanarua, Fatuha, Daniyawan and Masaurhi — affecting agricultural fields and homes. Several smaller rivers are also in spate and have spilled their banks. The floodwaters damaged embankments at several places, and also cut off road links between dozens of panchayats. “Water entered our village suddenly and its level started increasing. We realised that floods have come. Everybody rushed to save their household goods and food grains. We are just hoping that the situation does not worsen,” said Sundari Devi, a resident of Berwa village in Patna district. High volume of water was being released into the Sone river from the Indrapuri barrage, though the flow has reduced from 3.35 lakh cusecs on Sunday to 2.26 lakh cusecs on Monday. The Ganga, which acts as the master basin for almost all the rivers in Bihar, was in spate, though flowing below the danger level. This has slowed down the flow of the Sone, Punpun and other rivers into the Ganga, worsening the situation.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-363

03-08-2021||India||Pegasus:  Nitish Kumar supports probe into snooping scandal||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday supported the Opposition’s demand for a probe into the Pegasus snooping scandal. “It (probe) should definitely be done. We have been hearing about this for so many days. We must discuss this. These days anybody can indulge in such activities. Its every aspect should be seen and steps should be taken,” Nitish told reporters on the sidelines of his Janata Darbar. Referring to reports on the alleged use of Israeli spyware Pegasus to snoop on people, Nitish said: “Whatever has happened should be investigated thoroughly to find out whether some people were listening to phones or controlling them. The truth should be brought out before the people. Such a thing should not be done to disturb others.” Over 150 Indians, including journalists, Opposition leaders, constitutional figures and activists, figure on the list of potential targets of snooping using the spyware. On a probe by a joint parliamentary committee, Nitish said Parliament would have to take a decision on it. Nitish’s JDU is an ally of the NDA government in Bihar and at the Centre. Nitish’s support for an in-depth probe into the Pegasus scandal comes at a time when there is a deadlock in Parliament with the Opposition demanding an investigation. The two Houses have been able to transact very little business during the ongoing monsoon session.Rahul Gandhi has also invited other Opposition leaders to chalk out a joint strategy on the scandal. The matter has reached the Supreme Court, which is slated to hear a bunch of petitions on Thursday. The Opposition parties have alleged that the BJP-led government at the Centre had used the spyware to target individuals who did not toe its line. However, the Centre has denied its involvement.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-363
