Baghel held a series of meetings at Rahul Gandhi's residence for over three hours, where party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, AICC general secretary KC Venugopal and party's Chhattisgarh in-charge PL Punia were also present, and he gave a detailed account of the development schemes being initiated by the state.  Asked about any change of guard, he said the party high command has made him the chief minister and he will continue to hold the position till the time they wanted.  Baghel also stated that the party's in-charge for the state had already mentioned earlier that there was no discussion on the leadership and nothing more was left to be said, indicating that he has got a breather.  After the meeting, Baghel told reporters, "I have said everything that I had to say to my leader. Discussed politics and briefed him on the state's policies and governance. I invited him to the state and he has accepted the invite and will be visiting Chhattisgarh next week."  Trouble has been brewing in the Chhattisgarh Congress ever since Health Minister T S Singh Deo sought a change in leadership citing a power-sharing agreement on rotating chief ministership after the party came to power in the 2018 assembly polls.  This is Baghel's second meeting with Rahul Gandhi this week, after he met him on Tuesday, amid talk of a possible leadership change in the state.  Baghel later held a meeting with over 40 MLAs and ministers of Chhattisgarh who had arrived here in solidarity with the chief minister.  These legislators put up a show of strength in Baghel's support and wanted him to continue as chief minister. They have been camping in the national capital since Thursday.  They met Punia in the morning at his residence and later again at the AICC headquarters, where the chief minister was also present.  After meeting the legislators at the AICC, Baghel said they had come to meet their leaders and have met some of them.  He said they wanted to meet Rahul Gandhi, but will now meet him in their own areas when the former Congress chief visits the state.  "Rahul Gandhi ji will make a few visits to the state and see for himself the schemes that have been initiated by the Congress government in Chhattisgarh at his instance. He will visit Bastar, Sarguja, Bilaspur, Raipur and will see for himself the schemes being implemented in the state," Baghel said.  "The Gujarat model has failed and now the Chhattisgarh model has to be presented to the country now," he said.  Rahul Gandhi had earlier separately met Deo on Tuesday.  Both Baghel and Deo had also met Venugopal on Wednesday.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-268
27-08-2021||India||Supreme Court raps Gujarat government over report on fire incident that killed 13 last year||The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Gujarat government to table on the first day of its next Assembly session a report of commission of inquiry headed by Justice (retd) DA Mehta which had probed two incidents of fire at hospitals in Rajkot and Ahmedabad that happened last year, in which 13 patients were killed. A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and M R Shah told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to inform the Gujarat government about the view of the court, so that the report can be tabled in the house. Mehta said that it will be appropriate that the report before being given to anyone is allowed to be tabled in the House or it will set a wrong precedent. "The next session is scheduled to be held in September. I will request the government to table the report in the house as early as possible, Mehta said," and sought a time of three weeks. The bench said that counsel for victims of the fire incident have been seeking the report of the commission, which will not be appropriate to give unless it is tabled in the house. Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for some victim families, said that they be given compensation and the report of the commission should also be shared with them, so that they can file their response. Dave said that the commission has prepared the report without even talking to the victims and they are not privy to the report. The top court direction came while hearing a suo motu matter on the proper treatment of COVID-19 patients and dignified handling of dead bodies in the hospitals in which it had taken cognizance last year about fire incidents in hospitals. During the hearing, the bench asked senior advocate Manisha Lavkumar, also appearing for Gujarat government, under what provisions this notification which extended the deadline by three months for hospitals to rectify the violations of building by-laws, was issued by the State and how can such notification be sustained. She replied that under section 122 of Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act, the notification was issued and added that the government has taken a pragmatic approach in view of likely third wave of the COVID-19. Under section 122, a power is vested with the state government to facilitate the efficient administration of town planning and urban development legislation, orders can be passed. The bench told Lavkumar that by the notification building which did not have valid permission or were violating the by-laws or development control regulations, have been condoned and municipal bodies have been restrained from taking any coercive action against them. I"t has come down to this that there are no building control regulations in operation during this period in the state of Gujarat. It is suspended. It is a Windfall to developers and developers, which has no nexus to the pandemic," the bench said. On July 19, the top court had said hospitals have become like huge real estate industries instead of serving humanity in the face of COVID-19 tragedy while directing that 'nursing homes' running from 2-3 room flats in residential colonies which pay little attention to fire and building safety norms should be closed. It had pulled up the state government for extending the deadline till July next year for hospitals to rectify the building by-laws violations, and said the "carte blanche" notification was in teeth of its order of December 18 last year and people will continue to die in fire incidents. The top court had indicated that the state government will have to withdraw the notification or it will examine the issue. On December 18 last year, the top court had directed all the states to constitute a committee in each district to conduct fire audit of COVID-19 hospitals at least once a month, inform the management of medical establishments about any deficiency and report to the government for taking follow up action. It had said that COVID-19 hospitals, which have not obtained any no objection certificate from the concerned fire department, should be asked to immediately apply for NOC and after carrying necessary inspection, a decision shall be taken in this regard. The top court had directed that all states and Union Territories should appoint one nodal officer for each COVID hospital, if not already appointed, who shall be made responsible for ensuring compliance of all fire safety measures. The apex court had last year taken cognisance of the fire incident at a COVID hospital in Gujarat's Rajkot in which five patients had died. It had also taken note of similar incidents which had happened earlier in other COVID hospitals. It had taken note that Gujarat government has appointed Justice D A Mehta led commission to undertake enquiry with regard to fire in Shrey Hospital, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad, in addition to enquiry into the incident of fire in Uday Shivanand Hospital, Rajkot. The top court noted that the Centre has also directed the states and UTs to update their respective local building bye laws/fire services, synchronising them in line with the Model Bill on maintenance of fire and emergency service, 2019', circulated by the Ministry of Home Affairs on September 16 last year. The issue of Rajkot fire incident had cropped up in the top court which was hearing a suo motu case on proper treatment of COVID-19 patients and dignified handling of bodies in hospitals.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-268
27-08-2021||India||EC writes to parties on fund creation after SC order on criminal candidates||Days after the Supreme Court directed that political parties have to publish information regarding criminal antecedents of candidates on the homepage of their websites, the Election Commission has written to heads of recognised political parties saying that it has created a fund in which fines for contempt of court can be deposited for failing to comply with the apex court's directions. It also reminded the political parties that the Commission was directed by the apex court to carry out an extensive campaign to make every voter aware about his or her right to know and the availability of information regarding criminal antecedents of all contesting candidates. For this purpose, a fund was to be created within four weeks. The EC was also directed to create a separate cell which will also monitor the required compliances so that the court can be apprised promptly of non-compliance by any political party of the directions contained in the court's orders. The court had said that if such a political party fails to submit such compliance report with the EC, the poll panel will bring such non compliance by the political party to the notice of the court "as being in contempt of this court's orders/directions, which shall in future be viewed very seriously". The letter sent out on August 26 said in compliance of the Supreme Court directions, the Election Commission has created the "fund" in which fines for contempt of court can be deposited. It also gave out details of the bank account where such fines can be deposited. On August 10, the Supreme Court had said that political parties have to publish information regarding criminal antecedents of candidates on the homepage of their websites. The apex court had directed the Election Commission to create a dedicated mobile application containing information published by the candidates regarding their criminal antecedents so that voter gets information on his or her mobile phone at one stroke. A bench of justices R F Nariman and B R Gavai passed these directions in its verdict on a plea seeking contempt action against several political parties including the BJP and the Indian National Congress for non-compliance of its February 13, 2020 directions during Bihar assembly polls last year. The bench modified one of its earlier directions given in its February last year order on furnishing of details about the criminal antecedents of candidates. "We clarify that the direction in paragraph 4.4 of our order dated February 13, 2020 be modified and it is clarified that the details which are required to be published, shall be published within 48 hours of the selection of the candidate and not prior to two weeks before the first date of filing of nominations," it said. It also directed the EC to carry out an extensive awareness campaign to make every voter aware about his right to know and the availability of information regarding criminal antecedents of all contesting candidates. The apex court held several political parties guilty of its contempt in 2020 Bihar assembly polls for disobeying an order requiring them to publish antecedents of candidates within 48 hours of selection or not less than two weeks before filing of nominations and imposed varying fines on them. It directed that fine imposed for contempt of court in the matter may be directed to be paid in the fund which must be created within four weeks. In its February last year verdict aimed at decriminalising Indian politics, the apex court had directed the political parties to upload on their websites and social media platforms the details of pending criminal cases against their candidates and the reasons for selecting them as also for not giving ticket to those without criminal antecedents.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-268
27-08-2021||Business||Ritwiz Tiwari, founder Bizgurukul is all set to turn the tide of the Indian EdTech industry  through 5000+ courses in the next 5 years.||The Indian education system today massively lacks the modern skillset and practical knowledge for modern businesses. Most of the things students learn today are outdated and do not match the requirements of employers. Bizgurukul was initiated to bridge that gap and offer an easier chance to people who wish to upskill themselves and be industry-ready. Although Bizgurukul initially started with just two courses- personality development and public speaking, they have added more technical courses such as Instagram Marketing, Digital marketing, video editing, and many more. It is founded by three young minds who aim to change the Indian education space by offering modern skill-based courses at a highly affordable rate. Ritwiz Tiwari, a young man who is currently CEO and founder of the Bizgurukul, laid the foundation with a dream to upskill Indian youth and make them market-ready. He had a thing for entrepreneurship since his childhood and wanted to build something of his own. He had always been a creative and opportunistic child who believed that if life has given you an opportunity, the first and the only step is to accept it and work for it. His inclination towards business brought him to Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, where he pursued his bachelor of business administration degree. He learned the academic and technical parts of business management. During his college life, he took upon various opportunities and got hands-on experience. Those opportunities helped him learn what the industries are looking for and how the Indian education system lacked. Ritwiz, after his graduation, joined a multinational company. He wasn’t delighted with his position there. However, he believed that he was built to do something big in his life and put in tremendous efforts to climb up the corporate ladder. Throughout the period, he felt that he wasn’t rewarded adequately for his actions and that no matter how hard he worked, there were still certain restrictions that hindered his growth in corporate culture. Despite these factors, he has always expressed his gratitude towards his corporate job, as it helped him learn a lot about the marketing field. After a few years, he then left his job to build something of his own and create an environment where everyone has a chance to grow without any set limit. Ritwiz, during his course of work, realized how massively India lacks in terms of modern skillsets and practical knowledge that today’s industry needs. He could envision the massive potential that EdTech holds for this country and desired to change the old model of “people reaching out to education” and “taking education to people.” He wanted to bridge the gap between what people are taught and what the industry needs. India is a young country and can cater to the world’s needs but what we are taught in our educational institutes is highly outdated, but very few people tend to observe it and work to change it; Ritwiz was one of them. So he reached out to his two like-minded friends- Rohit Sharma and Keshav Lal- and explained his vision to change India’s EdTech industry. They both jumped the bandwagon without any hesitation and joined Ritwiz hands; these three together laid the founding stone of Bizgurukul. Bizgurukul was established on 24th March 2020 and had been running for over a year. The company was founded during the uncertain times of COVID-19, where people were losing jobs, and almost every sector had no idea of their future. Sailing through these tough times, Bizgurukul passed with flying colors under the leadership of Ritwiz Tiwari. He has been spinal cord for his team and guided them during the tough times, which is the reason for the company’s immense success. Bizgurukul has touched a million-dollar mark in just one year, and they plan to reach out 1 lakh students mark before this year ends. Ritwiz recently announced that he plans to add on more than 5000 advanced courses that can help Indian youth to upskill themselves and work in the high-paying sector. Their education portal would also support live training and one-on-one mentorship programs so that if anyone has any doubts even after their courses, they could be addressed and solved. Ritwiz dream is to have a significant impact on India’s growth through education that matters the most. The way Bizgukul has performed till now under his leadership, the company will surely turn tides in the Indian education sector.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-269

27-08-2021||India||Why does Remote Work feel so laborious and inorganic? Jackstien Practices’ Nishant Shah explains||We go on speaking about the endless benefits of Remote Work till we reach the inevitable question… if it was just so good, why didn’t we do it earlier? Well, aside from the obvious fact that technology has caught up recently over the last decade, the key issue is, simply, that we just didn’t dare. We didn’t want to upset an apple cart of that size and probably wouldn’t have managed it even if we wanted to. That is a figurative kart that could have only bowed to something as big as a pandemic. Think of a child who gets into a pool only after much trepidation. Having experienced the joys of the pool, the child then refuses to get out. That’s remote work in a nutshell. It’s hard to imagine and even harder to look forward to going back to the old ways. That probably explains reports of the ‘great waves’ of resignation in western nations where companies are asking people to come back in. This is being reflected here as well. Other companies insisting on a return are losing their people to companies offering remote work as a competitive advantage. So, is it all so easy? Not quite. Nothing so revolutionary can be. Companies are often in a quandary. While employees are closer to the benefits of remote work, senior management is closer to the troubles and problems caused by remote work, so much so that there is temptation to disregard the massive cost benefits because of inability to predict and manage the problems. One explanation is that companies have basically continued to do remotely what they did in the office collectively. While that’s understandable in the hurried rush to somehow deal with COVID, it did continue to feel like a square peg in a round hole. Further, at the time of the hurried rush, no one bothered about cost effectiveness of what they are doing. After all, most people didn’t realize that this was how it was going to be long term. They struggled to get by, to adapt processes and make do with just enough – after all, who could ask for more in such circumstances? Moreover, everyone understood and accommodated – your customers, the tax authorities and even your creditors and billers. But no more. Expectations will swing back to the old ones. And then keep heading north. The impact of the problems with remote work will keep feeling bigger, stronger and ever more difficult to manage. Jackstien Practices and Consulting International have evolved from the traditional management consulting firm to having developed a unique, rarified and much needed skill set. Under the leadership of their Managing Partner, Nishant Shah, they have specialized in all things remote work. Nishant has spent twenty years across multinational banks, most recently as Executive Director in charge of three portfolios of JPMorgan Chase in India, including Operational Risk for India. Regarded as the foremost expert in his field, he has applied his breadth of skills to help businesses evolve into the future. And we don’t use the term ‘breadth’ lightly – multiple facets of remote work from every perspective and aspect have been researched, studied and solved for. Jackstien Practices advises clients on logistics (think space management to hot-desking), technology (think virtualization to automation), asset reallocations (think space redesign to collaborative workspaces), statutory management (from taxation to labor law), financials (from cost management to restructuring), people (from supervisory changes to employee morale), training (virtual participation to asynchronous communications), process re-engineering (botification to customer service) and legal aspects (data confidentiality to employee codes). The scope of services was comprehensive, a consolidated offering under one roof so that clients do not run pillar to post trying to cobble together different inefficient and often conflicting solutions. The new world needs new consultants, and as Nishant says, “What helped us survive the pandemic won’t be enough to thrive post-pandemic – it’s a much higher bar. More than simply realigning, it needs reimagining so we don’t waste the opportunity” The road to the vast benefits of remote work is mined with pitfalls. We reckon that specializations like Jackstien Practices’ will be critical but till then, many of us may need to struggle with the square pegs and round holes.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-269

27-08-2021||India||Narayan Rane warns Shiv Sena, says he will bring out cases 'one by one'||In a veiled warning to the ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, Union minister and BJP leader Narayan Rane, who is locked in a bitter fight with it, on Friday said he knew a lot of things about the party and its leaders and would bring out cases "step by step". Without taking anybody's name, he said he knew who had asked whom to throw acid on brother's wife. Rane was speaking at a rally in Ratnagiri district as a part of his 'Jan Ashirwad Yatra'. Earlier this week, he had made remarks against Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, which kicked up a row and led to his arrest on Tuesday before his release a few hours later. The episode had sparked off clashes between Shiv Sena and BJP supporters. "I have worked with them for 39 years, I know a lot of things. I know who asked whom to throw acid on his own brother's wife. What kind of 'sanskar' is it?" the BJP leader said on Friday. In a veiled attack on Uddhav Thackeray, who is also the president of Shiv Sena, Rane said, "What did one achieve by arresting a union minister? I will bring out cases step by step." "A Sena boy - Varun Sardesai - had come outside my home (in Mumbai) and threatened me. If he comes next time, he won't go back," the former Maharashtra chief minister added. Sardesai is a leader of the Yuva Sena, the youth wing of the Shiv Sena. The Yuva Sena workers had protested outside Rane's bungalow in Mumbai on Tuesday over his remarks. Rane, who started off his political career as a Shiv Sena worker, became the state CM in 1999. However, in 2005, he was expelled from the Sena for "anti-party activities". After that he joined the Congress and stayed there till 2017. After quitting the Congress, he launched the Maharashtra Swabhiman Paksha in October 2017. In 2018, he declared support for the BJP and was elected to the Rajya Sabha on that party's nomination. In October 2019, he merged his party with the BJP. He was made the Union Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) last month in the cabinet reshuffle.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-269

27-08-2021||India||Delhi schools to reopen in phased manner from September 1||Schools for classes 9-12, colleges and coaching institutions will reopen in the national capital from September 1 following prolonged closure in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Delhi government announced on Friday. A decision in this regard was taken at a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). A panel set up by the DDMA had earlier this week submitted its report recommending phase-wise reopening of schools in the national capital. The decision came following a marked improvement in the COVID-19 situation in Delhi, following a recent brutal second wave of the infection which claimed many lives, with the shortage of oxygen at hospitals across the city adding to the woes. "In view of decreasing COVID cases, schools are being slowly reopened in Delhi with complete precautions, so that the learning loss for students can be reduced. We have to bring back life on track and take care of studies as well as health of students," Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said teaching and learning activities will continue to be conducted in a blended mode. "No child will be forced to attend physical classes and there will be no compulsory attendance. Consent of the parents will be must for students to attend physical classes," he said during a press conference. While Sisodia said no final decision has been taken regarding junior classes and a call will be taken after analysing the effect of reopening schools for senior classes, sources indicated that schools for classes 6 to 8 may reopen from September 8. Schools in the national capital were ordered shut last year in March ahead of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus. While several states started partial reopening of schools from October last year, Delhi government allowed reopening in January only for classes 9 to 12. However, schools were again completely shut in April following an aggressive second wave of COVID-19. University Grants Commission (UGC) had also left the decision about reopening of colleges and varsities with respective state governments depending upon the COVID-19 situation. The Directorate of Education (DoE) will soon notify the detailed SOPs for reopening of schools. Separate entry and exit to avoid crowding, calling 50 per cent students of classroom seating capacity, increased facility for cleaning and sanitisation, availability of quarantine room and random collection of samples of students and staff on regular basis are among the SOPs recommended by the DDMA committee.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-269

Sources said that Baghel has been called to Delhi by Venugopal for further talks to resolve the crisis in the Chhattisgarh Congress. The state's Health Minister T S Singh Deo has been seeking the rotation on the chief minister's post, claiming there was an agreement made in this regard when the Congress assumed power in 2018. Deo has also said that every member in a team aspires to be the captain, making it clear that he is eyeing the top post in the state.

27-08-2021||India||Navjot Singh Sidhu asks Congress to give him the freedom to make decisions||Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu has urged the party leadership to allow him freedom to take decisions, else he will give a befitting reply. The Congress, however, said state chiefs are free to take their decisions within the party's norms and constitution. Harish Rawat, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of party affairs in Punjab, said if the state chiefs will not take decisions, who else will. Sidhu had said earlier that the party high command should give him the freedom to take decisions and he will ensure that the Congress remains in power in Punjab for the next 20 years. He said he has prepared a roadmap in this regard. "The party high command should allow me the freedom to take decisions, else I will give a befitting reply," he said addressing a meeting in Amritsar. Meanwhile, under fire for his controversial comments on Kashmir, Malvinder Singh Mali on Friday quit as adviser to Sidhu. However, Mali did not term it as a "resignation". In a statement posted on his Facebook page, Mali said, "I humbly submit that I withdraw my consent given for tendering suggestions to Navjot Singh Sidhu". Mali, in another Facebook post, claimed that the question of his resignation does not arise as he never accepted the post. Neither accepted any post, nor resigned from any post, Mali said in a post in Punjabi. Amid a power tussle in Punjab, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had asked Sidhu on Sunday to "rein in" his advisers after two of them made "atrocious" comments recently on sensitive issues like Kashmir and Pakistan. Rawat had also said that the two advisers need to go. Sidhu on August 11 had appointed Mali, a former government teacher and political analyst, and Pyare Lal Garg, a former registrar of Baba Farid University of Health and Sciences, as his advisers to seek their wise counsel. In a recent social media post, Mali had waded into the issue of revocation of Article 370 of the Constitution, which gave special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. He had reportedly said if Kashmir was a part of India, then what was the need to have Articles 370 and 35A. He had also said, Kashmir is a country of Kashmiri people. Garg, another adviser of Sidhu, had reportedly questioned the chief minister's criticism of Pakistan. The chief minister had warned against such "atrocious and ill-conceived comments that were potentially dangerous to the peace and stability of the state and the country".||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-269
27-08-2021||India||Harish Rawat seeks to be relieved as Congress' Punjab affairs in-charge||Citing next year's assembly polls in Uttarakhand where he is the Congress' campaign committee chairman, Harish Rawat has sought to be relieved as the in-charge of party affairs in Punjab. He said that to concentrate on the upcoming polls in Uttarakhand, it had been on his mind to seek to be relieved of the responsibility of the party's Punjab affairs in charge. "Yes, this is the reason," the former Uttarakhand chief minister told reporters in Dehradun on Thursday when asked if he has sought to be relieved of the charge as Punjab affairs in-charge so that he could concentrate on the upcoming polls in his state. He added that he would abide by whatever direction is given to him by the party. "If my party asks me to continue (as Punjab affairs in-charge), I will continue," said Rawat. Punjab and Uttarakhand will go to polls next year. While the Congress is seeking to retain power in Punjab, it aims to return to power by defeating the ruling BJP in the hill state. Punjab is witnessing an infight between the camps of Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. Rawat, who is currently in Delhi to meet the party's senior leadership, had recently said next year's Punjab Assembly polls will be fought under the leadership of Amarinder Singh, delivering a snub to the leaders wanting his removal. Rawat had also said that there was no threat to the Amarinder Singh-led government in Punjab. Reacting to Sidhu's statement urging the party high command to allow him the freedom to take decisions, Rawat said party chiefs are free to take their decisions within the party's norms and constitution. "I will see the context in which Navjot Singh Sidhu has made these remarks. Mr Sidhu is the respected chief of the Punjab unit. Who will have the power to take decisions if not the state presidents," he told reporters in Delhi on Friday. Rawat added state presidents are free to take decisions within the party's constitution and position. Sidhu had said earlier that the party high command should give him the freedom to take decisions and he will ensure that the Congress remains in power for the next 20 years. He said he has prepared a roadmap in this regard. "The party high command should allow me the freedom to take decisions, else I will give a befitting reply," he said addressing a meeting in Amritsar.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-270
27-08-2021||India||HC asks Centre to respond to pleas challenging IT Rules||The Delhi High Court Friday asked the Centre to reply to pleas by Facebook and WhatsApp challenging the new IT rules for social media intermediaries requiring the messaging app to trace chats and make provisions to identify the first originator of the information. The pleas have challenged the new rules on the grounds that they violate the right to privacy and are unconstitutional. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice and asked the Centre through the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to file reply to the petition as well as application to stay the implementation of the Rules. The court listed the matter for further hearing on October 22.

The Facebook-owned company, WhatsApp, in its plea said the requirement of intermediaries enabling the identification of the first originator of information in India upon government or court order puts end-to-end encryption and its benefits "at-risk".

27-08-2021||India||Bar Council to meet on curtailing lawyers' strikes, Supreme Court informed||The Bar Council of India on Friday informed the Supreme Court that it has convened a meeting of state bar councils and proposes to formulate rules for curtailing strikes by lawyers and initiating action against advocates who participate or instigate others for abstaining from work and strikes on social media. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah was informed by senior advocate Manan Kumar Mishra, who is the chairman of the Bar Council of India (BCI), that they have convened a meeting of all State Bar Associations on September 4. "We will be holding a meeting of all the state Bar Councils and Associations on September 4 and we propose to formulate rules to curtail strikes by lawyers and to initiate action against advocates who instigate strikes on social media, Mishra said. The bench recorded the submission of Mishra and said that it appreciates the action taken by BCI. On the request of Mishra, the top court posted the matter for further hearing in the third week of September. At the outset, Mishra apologised for not coming up with suggestions earlier in compliance with the court's order last year, due to the onset of pandemic. On July 26, the top court had said it had delivered its verdict on February 28 last year and the BCI and the state bar councils were directed to give concrete suggestions to deal with the problem of strikes and abstention from work by lawyers. It had noted that no response has been received from BCI and other state associations. The top court had asked Mishra to render assistance to the court in his capacity as the chairperson of the Bar Council of India. On February 28 last year, the top court was irked by lawyers holding strike every Saturday for 35 years in Uttarakhand district courts over reasons like 'bomb blast in Pakistan', 'earthquake in Nepal' or 'condolence references for family members' and had warned the advocates concerned of contempt action if they persisted with it. Holding the strike illegal, the top court had sought response from BCI and all the State Bar Councils within six weeks to suggest the further course of action to deal with the problem of strikes/abstaining from work by the lawyers. Taking suo motu cognisance of the issue, the top court had emphasised that at a time when the judiciary is facing serious problems of pendency and delay in disposal of cases, how can the institution as a whole can afford such four days strike in a month. The top court had said that every month on 3-4 Saturdays, the advocates are on strike on one pretext or the other and added that had the lawyers worked on those days, it would have achieved the ultimate goal of speedy justice, which is now a fundamental right. It had said that boycotting courts on every Saturday in the districts of Dehradun, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar in Uttarakhand is not justifiable at all and as such it tantamount to contempt of the courts. The top court had dismissed the appeal filed by the Dehradun Bar Association challenging the Uttarakhand High Court order of September 25, 2019 which had asked the lawyers' and their associations to withdraw the strike in district courts and warned them of contempt action. The top court had said that despite the law laid down in various verdicts of the apex court, the court had time and again deprecated the lawyers for going on strikes but it continued unabated. "Even in the present case, the advocates have been boycotting the courts on all Saturdays, in the entire district of Dehradun, in several parts of the district of Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar district of the State of Uttaranchal. Because of such strikes, the ultimate sufferers are the litigants," the top court had said. It had noted the information sent by the High Court to the Law Commission with respect to the state for the years 2012- 2016, which showed that in Dehradun district, the advocates were on strike for 455 days (on an average 91 days per year) and in Haridwar district it was 515 days (about 103 days per year). "To go on strike/boycott courts cannot be justified under the guise of the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. Nobody has the right to go on strike/boycott courts. Even, such a right, if any, cannot affect the rights of others and more particularly, the right of Speedy Justice guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution," it had said. Referring to the Law Commission's report, the high court had noted that strikes by advocates or their abstinence from courts varied from local, national to international issues, having no relevance to the working of the courts, and were seldom for justifiable reasons. "To mention a few, bomb blast in a Pakistan school, amendments to Sri Lanka's Constitution, inter-state river water disputes, attack on/murder of an advocate, earthquake in Nepal, condoling the death of near relatives of advocates, expressing solidarity to advocates of other state bar associations, moral support to movements by social activists, heavy rains....and even for kavi-sammelans," the high court had noted in its verdict. In its verdict, the high court had noted that "genesis of this peculiar form" of protest of boycotting work on Saturdays for over 35 years was traceable to western Uttar Pradesh, of which the aforesaid districts formed part of, before the state of Uttarakhand was created on November 9, 2000.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-270

27-08-2021||India||Two Uttarakhand officials suspended for involvement in Kumbh Mela fake testing scam||Two officials in Uttarakhand have been suspended for their alleged involvement in the fake COVID-19 testing scam during the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar. Then Mela officer (medical and health) Dr Arjun Singh Sengar and then officer-in-charge (medical and health) Dr N K Tyagi were suspended on Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami's orders Thursday night.

"Corruption and carelessness at any level will not be tolerated. Stern action will be taken against anyone who is found guilty in connection with the scam," Dhami said. The probe panel found the officials to have been hand in glove with the companies involved in carrying out the fake rapid antigen tests during the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar. It had recommended disciplinary action against them for being reckless and causing financial losses to the state. The probe committee headed by the Chief Development Officer of Haridwar had submitted its report to the government on August 16.

27-08-2021||India||Chugh hits out at Mehbooba over her Taliban remarks||Lambasting PDP president Mehbooba Mufti for her reference to the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan to call upon the government to restore Jammu and Kashmir's special status, BJP general secretary Tarun Chugh has said she is daydreaming and that her wishes will never come true. Calling Mehbooba's remarks as "anti-national", Chugh said on Thursday Jammu and Kashmir has outright rejected her Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and "the Gupkar Gang", referring to the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration -- an alliance of some mainstream Jammu and Kashmir parties. Referring to popular TV series 'Mungerilal ke Haseen Sapne', Chugh said, "Mungerilal was dreaming at night, but Mehbooba Mufti does it in the day. They will never come true." Addressing her party workers earlier this month, Mehbooba had asked the Centre to take a lesson out of Afghanistan where the Taliban seized power and made the US flee, and urged the government to hold dialogue in Jammu and Kashmir and return its special status which was revoked in 2019. Referring to the Taliban seizing power in Afghanistan, the former chief minister warned the Centre to not test us" and asked the government to mend its ways, understand the situation, and see what is happening in your neighbourhood." Reacting to her remarks, BJP leader Chugh said, "It was J&K's misfortune that these dynasties (PDP and National Conference) killed development here and whenever public solicited response they started speaking in the language of China and Pakistan. Now they are talking about Taliban. It is a nation run by (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi ji. Anyone who does any misadventure will be taught a lesson. Pakistan has been already taught a lesson." He said that nepotism of the PDP and the National Conference (NC) has murdered democracy in J&K. He said Jammu and Kashmir is fast transforming into a "tourism capital from terrorism capital". "Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president J P Nadda, J&K is fast transforming into 'tourism capital from terrorism capital'. Development and safety of J&K is the commitment of Modi ji and the BJP is working to reach the target," he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-270
27-08-2021||India||Afghanistan crisis: Opposition broadly backs govt’s efforts||India, like much of the rest of the world, has decided to adopt a wait-and-watch policy on Afghanistan to see whether the new government in Kabul is entirely Taliban-run or has a power-sharing component with other Afghan leaders. Sharing the government’s concern about the approaching August 31 deadline for the US pullout from Afghanistan, external affairs minister S. Jaishankar on Thursday said the situation was fluid and that India was consulting key stakeholders, partners and regional countries to assess the ground reality. Jaishankar was fielding the Opposition’s questions on how the Narendra Modi government planned to deal with the evolving situation in Afghanistan. The Opposition was broadly supportive of the government’s efforts, calling a ceasefire to the acrimony of the monsoon session of Parliament. There was general acknowledgement of the difficulties that all countries are facing in the evolving situation. Jaishankar himself in a tweet acknowledged the spirit in which the Opposition participated in the meeting. “Briefed the Floor Leaders of all political parties today on Afghanistan. 37 leaders from 31 parties attended. Thank them all. There is longstanding national sentiment on Afghanistan. Therefore, there is national concern now at developments. We are gathered with a national spirit,” he tweeted. The briefing — which was initiated by the government itself — was mainly on the evacuation exercise, the challenges faced in the process and the measures the government had taken over the past year to prepare for such an eventuality. The government, however, was unable to provide information on the number of Indians still remaining in Afghanistan. According to the minister, 565 people had been evacuated over the past week and a half. This includes 175 embassy personnel, 263 other Indians, 112 Afghan nationals (including Sikhs and Hindus), besides 15 people from other countries. These evacuations, the government said, were done under challenging circumstances such as frequent firing near the airport and in Kabul, multiple checkpoints manned by various groups, issues at the airport, landing permission delays and the need for overflight clearances from various countries as the effort was to avoid Afghan airspace as far as possible. On the pre-emptive measures, the government said it had temporarily withdrawn Indian personnel from the consulates in Herat and Jalalabad in April 2020, scaled down the embassy in Kabul in June this year and evacuated Indians from the consulates in Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif over the past month. With the Opposition leaders expressing concern about the remaining Indians in Afghanistan, Jaishankar assured them that bringing everyone out was the government’s first priority. The minister, however, had to face flak from the Left for the pro-US alignment of India’s foreign policy. CPI’s Binoy Viswam sought to remind everyone that the Taliban were the brainchild of the US and urged India not to put all its eggs in the American basket. Viswam was, however, appreciative of the democratic manner in which Jaishankar conducted the whole meeting. “Though parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi had said that the smaller parties would get time to speak after the larger parties only if there was time, Jaishankar heard everyone out patiently and answered all our questions. This was a departure from the meetings with this government where it is usually a monologue,” Viswam told The Telegraph. Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda stressed the need for India to handle the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast properly to be able to play a bigger role on the world stage and secure “our multiple interests in the region”. Trinamul Congress leaders extended support to the government for all the steps taken in the larger interest of the country.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-271

A university source conceded it was rare for the VC to use his emergency powers and bypass the executive council — which was to take the final decision on the controversial syllabus changes — but added that the authorities did not want any further “dissent”. A university media release that defended the changes at length, suggesting the widespread criticism had hit home, said the varsity believed its syllabuses should contain material “which do not hurt the sentiments of any individual”. It did not name any particular text. A member of the oversight committee that recommended the changes told The Telegraph on the condition of anonymity that Draupadi — which portrays a tribal woman’s struggle against oppression — had been dropped since it contains the description of a rape. A statement issued by three dissenting members of the 130-member academic council — which had on Tuesday cleared the changes — slammed the comment. “To use hurt sentiments as an excuse to delete texts is a blatant attempt to impose thought control of the dominant and privileged social groups,” said the joint statement from Rajesh Kumar, Mithuraaj Dhusiya and Biswajit Mohanty. Draupadi is about Dopdi Mehjen, a Santhal woman who, along with her husband, murders rich landlords and grabs their wells, the main sources of water in their village. She is captured by an officer who orders his men to rape her. Afterwards, asked to cover up, she refuses saying: “There isn’t a man here that I should be ashamed.” Draupadi has been part of the Delhi University syllabus since 1999 “owing to its seminal academic value”, said a dissent note by 15 academic council members protesting Tuesday’s green light to the syllabus changes. They underlined that the story also figured in the University Grants Commission’s “Model Syllabus 2019” for BA (Hons) English. What Delhi University has found liable to “hurt the sentiments” in print has stirred emotions on stage and motivated in real life. In her stage performance of Draupadi, celebrated Manipuri actor Sabitri Heisnam drops her clothes in a bold gesture of protest that paralyses the security forces and moves audiences. Her performance is known to have inspired 12 Manipuri mothers to strip naked in a public protest in 2004 against the army, which was accused of raping and killing a woman. Oversight committee chairman M.K. Pandit told The Telegraph: “We received complaints against the story Draupadi. I read the story myself.” Sultana’s Dreams by Begum Rokeya has replaced Draupadi in the Delhi University syllabus. The university has also dropped from the English course works by two Tamil Dalit writers — Bama and Sukritharani — triggering condemnation from Tamil Nadu chief minister M.K. Stalin and several MPs from the southern state. The dissent note by the 15 academic council members alleged that procedures were flouted while changing the undergraduate syllabuses for English, history, sociology and political science. It said the only competent authorities to frame or change any syllabus were the “committee of courses” of the departments concerned, and that varsity rules had no provision for any oversight committee in the matter. It added that the oversight committee had no members from any of the four departments whose syllabuses were changed. The dissent note criticised the replacement of the Chandrabati Ramayana — a feminist reading of the Ramayana — with Tulsidas’s version of the epic in an elective paper titled “Pre-colonial Indian Literatures” in the English syllabus. Sukritharani’s poems Debt and My Body and two chapters from Bama’s autobiography, Sangati, have been replaced with the works of Ramabai, a writer from the dominant castes. Chief minister Stalin said the university’s move was “blatantly partisan and completely unacceptable”. In a statement he tweeted along with the pictures of the two writers, Stalin said: “This practice of viewing such literary works either through the prism of party politics or communal agenda should be given up.” He urged Delhi University to restore the two Dalit feminist writers’ works to the syllabus. Madurai MP Su Venkatesan of the CPM and the Dalit MP from the VCK, Ravikumar, too criticised the varsity’s decision. The university release said: “Some issues highlighted by a section of media regarding the content of the syllabus are misplaced and unfounded as the syllabus of the course has been passed through a democratic process with the involvement of all the relevant stakeholders and necessary deliberations at appropriate forums.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-271
27-08-2021||India||Gujarat Covid death toll: A dubious ‘world record’||The excess mortality estimated for only 54 of Gujarat’s 162 municipalities exceeds the official Covid-19 death count for the entire state, researchers said in a study released on Thursday. The study has estimated 480 per cent (4.8-fold) more deaths than expected in Gujarat during April 2021, when the state’s daily new cases spiked nearly six-fold from 2,400 in early April to 14,000 by month-end. This is the highest percentage increase in deaths recorded in a single month anywhere in the world, a rise higher than Ecuador’s 411 per cent spike during April 2020 and Peru’s 345 per cent swell during April 2021. The researchers, who used data from civil death registers, have also estimated that around 16,000 excess deaths occurred in the 54 municipalities between March 2020 and April 2021. India’s health ministry, which relies on the states for Covid-19 mortality data, had until Thursday recorded 10,080 deaths in Gujarat among a nationwide count of over 436,000. “The vast majority of these excess deaths likely represent direct deaths from Covid-19 in the absence of any other known catastrophe,” the researchers at the Harvard TC Chan School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the University of California, Berkeley, said in their study. The new study represents the latest effort to estimate excess deaths during the Covid-19 epidemic in India amid contentions by some public health experts that the official death counts appear inconsistent with the body counts during April and May this year. The health ministry has challenged the claims of large undercounting of deaths, asserting that while some deaths could have been missed, it has repeatedly asked the states and district authorities to conduct audits to report any missed deaths. The Harvard-UCB researchers analysed civil register data from 54 Gujarat municipalities – across 24 of the state’s 33 districts --- taking the deaths between January 2019 and February 2020 as the baseline mortality data and comparing it to the deaths between March 2020 and April 2021. The registers record a total of 44,568 deaths in the 54 municipalities since March 2020, with the sharpest increase in deaths during the second wave. This represents around 16,000 excess deaths compared with the baseline count between January 2019 and February 2020. Between January and April 2021, the registers show 17,882 deaths, a 102 per cent increase over the average for the same months in 2019 and 2020. “The take-home here is that reliance on death certificates to count mortality from pandemics like this is not sufficient,” emergency medicine specialist Satchit Balsari, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and the study’s co-author, told The Telegraph. The other co-authors are demographer Ayesha Mahmud from the UCB, researchers Rolando Acosta and Caroline Buckee from the Harvard School of Public Health, and Biraj Patnaik from the New Delhi-based National Foundation of India. “Governments must look for alternative ways to better estimate mortality in the absence of a robust and nuanced death registration system,” Balsari said. “The high excess death estimate also warrants a closer look into who died, when and how, so we can mount appropriate and effective medical responses.” The health ministry has consistently denied large undercounting of Covid-19 deaths. It has said excess mortality covers deaths from all causes and that attributing them to Covid-19 is “totally misleading”. A senior infectious disease epidemiologist said civil registers represented a “standard source” worldwide for estimating excess mortality, whether from infectious diseases or heat waves. “We have to assume that the vast proportion of excess deaths were due to Covid-19 — there is no other explanation for such large increases as 4.8 times (compared with the same period in) the previous year,” the epidemiologist, who requested not to be named, told this newspaper. “Some excess deaths may be explained through deaths of patients of other critical conditions such as heart attacks who could not get treatment in time because the hospitals were overwhelmed by Covid-19,” the epidemiologist said. “But such deaths cannot explain the observed excess.” Last month, researchers at the Centre for Global Health Research, University of Toronto, Canada, had estimated on the basis of three data sources that India’s Covid-19 death counts might range between 2.7 million and 3.4 million, or at least six times the official count. The former chief economic adviser to the Indian government, Arvind Subramanian, currently at Brown University in the US, and his colleagues too had last month estimated India’s excess deaths at 3.4 million, 4 million or 4.9 million, using three different methodologies. The health ministry has, however, said India has “a robust system for recording Covid-19 deaths” and while some cases may remain undetected, “missing out on deaths is unlikely”. “Well-conducted research studies on mortality are usually done after the event when data on mortality are available from reliable sources,” the ministry had said last month. A public health specialist said it was puzzling that the excess death estimates for India were primarily emerging from academic institutions outside the country. “This is data entirely generated by our civil registration system,” the expert said. “Why aren’t Indian academic institutions analysing it?”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-271
27-08-2021||India||Centre asks higher educational institutions to fill up vacant faculty posts over the next one year||The Centre has asked higher educational institutions to fill up vacant faculty posts over the next one year, nearly two years after then education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal had assured the Lok Sabha that the recruitments would be done in six months. Higher education secretary Amit Khare wrote to the heads of the IITs, IIMs and central universities on Tuesday, asking them to fill up the vacant faculty posts in Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC) and economically weaker sections (EWS) categories. “In order to clear this backlog, it has been decided that all CHEIs (central higher educational institutions) should fill these vacancies in a mission mode within a period of one year starting from September 5, 2021, to September 4, 2022, and to report about action taken and progress made in this regard,” the letter from Khare stated. The institutions have to send monthly progress reports to the government and also mention the status of the appointments in their annual reports. Nearly 40 per cent teaching posts are vacant at central universities, while around 30 per cent are empty at the IITs and IIMs. During the debate on the Central Universities (Amendment) Bill, 2019, in the Lok Sabha on July 12, Pokhriyal had assured that the vacancies would be filled up in six months. “Niyuktia ke bare mein hum keh diye hai ki agle chhay mahine ke andar rikt padon ko bhara jayega. (About recruitments, I say that all the vacant posts will be filled up in the next six months),” Pokhriyal had said. The deadline ended on January 12, 2020. But the post continued to remain vacant, barring at some institutions such as Jawaharlal Nehru University that has appointed over 100 faculty members amid complaints of irregularities. Several universities are managing with guest and ad-hoc teachers. Delhi University has over 4,000 ad-hoc faculty members who are on contract and do not get promotions and leaves. Allahabad University has nearly 300 faculty members against the sanctioned strength of 850. An IIT Delhi faculty member said non-availability of qualified candidates was impeding appointments. “You need candidates ideally having proper, good quality PhD degrees. But there are not enough candidates. There has been no effort in the last several years to create a pool of qualified candidates. This needs long-term planning and academic vision, which is missing,” the faculty member said. He said many talented students were not taking interest in academics because of the “low dignity” associated with the profession. He said many talented candidates from reserved categories faced discrimination during interviews. “The ‘not found suitable’ tag is many times used arbitrarily. There is no mechanism to check it,” he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-271
27-08-2021||India||Ram Nath Kovind issues warrants appointing nine new judges to SC||President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday issued warrants appointing nine new judges to the Supreme Court, a day after the Prime Minister’s Office cleared the collegium’s recommendations. The apex court’s working strength has now risen to 33, one short of the sanctioned strength of 34 judges including the Chief Justice of India. Sources said the new judges could be sworn in on August 31, although the final decision has not been taken yet. The nine names approved by the President has three women judges, including Justice B.V. Nagarathna, a Karnataka High Court judge who is in line to become the country’s first woman chief justice in October 2027, although for a brief period of 40 days. The other names cleared are Karnataka High Court Chief Justice A.S. Oka, Gujarat High Court Chief Justice Vikram Nath, Sikkim High Court Chief Justice J.K. Maheshwarui, Telangana High Court Chief Justice Hima Kohli, Kerala High Court judge C.T. Ravi Kumar, Madras High Court judge M.M. Sundresh, Gujarat High Court judge Bela M. Trivedi and senior advocate P.S. Narasimha. This is the first time nine names have been cleared at one go for judge’s assignments at the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court collegium has Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana and four other senior-most judges — Justices U.U. Lalit, A.M. Khanwilkar, D.Y. Chandrachud and L. Nageswara Rao. The collegium proposed the names on August 18. The Centre, which had earlier been chided by the top court several times for sitting on collegium recommendations, cleared the names within a week. Sources said the government wanted some names to be reconsidered but CJI Ramana declined to concede the request. According to the sources, the Centre had till as late as Wednesday raised objections to the choice of Justice Kohli and Narasimha. The contention on Justice Kohli was said to be that Delhi already had three judges in the Supreme Court — Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Sanjiv Khanna and Ravindra Bhat. Justice Kohli’s first assignment as judge had been at Delhi High Court. In the case of Narasimha, the objection was claimed to have been raised on behalf of a senior law officer of the Centre. However, Justice Ramana, the sources said, made it clear that all the nine names must be cleared and that there would be no reconsideration. Under the memorandum of procedure that governs the appointment and transfer of judges, the Centre can raise objections over collegium recommendations but has to accept if the collegium reiterates the names.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-271
27-08-2021||India||Modi govt reaches out to OBCs to decisively win UP polls next year||The Narendra Modi government is assiduously reaching out to the OBCs, including planning to give consent for a caste census, as part of its strategy to decisively win the Uttar Pradesh polls next year, sources said. OBCs account for over 50 per cent of Uttar Pradesh’s population. The BJP is trying to secure a chunk of their votes, especially that of the non-Yadav OBCs. The outcome of the election in the country’s largest state is widely believed to be crucial in setting the tone for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, and the BJP seems to be going all out to prove that it stays unbeaten. There is pressure on the BJP to win Uttar Pradesh in a big way after the massive defeat in the Bengal Assembly polls. “The central government is considering more than one move to reaffirm its commitment towards the backward classes,” a Union minister said. “We are not averse to going for a caste census,” the minister added. The sources said the Centre was considering accepting the demand for a caste census, announcing sub-categorisation of OBCs and clearing the backlog in vacancies under the OBC quota. The BJP and the Modi government are in principle opposed to a caste census on the ground that it would defeat the goal of building a “casteless society”, but electoral compulsions could see the party agree to it. “Increasing support from the OBCs has played a big role in the BJP’s major poll victories in the Hindi heartland and so the government will do everything to keep the support base intact,” a BJP leader said. Led by Modi, the BJP recently went all out to shower praise on former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh, an OBC leader who passed away recently. Top party leaders gathered at Kalyan’s funeral and the state government announced that main roads in six districts would be named after the former chief minister. Apart from courting the OBCs, the BJP has also been addressing other issues to counter anti-incumbency. The Union cabinet on Wednesday approved an increased fair and remunerative price (FRP) of Rs 290 per quintal for sugarcane, a decision that was expected to mollify angry cane farmers in western Uttar Pradesh. Western Uttar Pradesh, a major sugar belt, has been the epicentre of protests against the three contentious farm laws. Apart from the farm laws, dues of sugarcane farmers and unremunerative prices have been the major complaints against the ruling BJP at the Centre and the state. The Centre’s decision will now push the Yogi Adityanath government to increase its state-advised price (SAP) for sugarcane, stuck at Rs 315 per quintal for three years. In addition to the FRP or minimum support price the sugarcane mills have to pay to the farmers, states announce their own SAP and it’s usually higher than the price fixed by the Centre. Congress-ruled Punjab recently announced a cane SAP of Rs 360 per quintal, up by Rs 50.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-271
27-08-2021||India||Kerala forest official conjures false case to discredit junior||A Kerala forest official conjured a false case of illegal felling to discredit a junior with jurisdiction over the area, and to kill a probe into a genuine timber scam the junior had unearthed elsewhere, an inquiry by a senior forest officer has found. The controversy has pushed the Pinarayi Vijayan government on the back foot over its failure to punish the official indicted — Wayanad conservator of forests N.T. Sajan — and over the chief minister inviting to his Onam lunch a journalist accused of colluding with Sajan. The June 29 probe report by the additional principal chief conservator of forests (forest, land and resources), Rajesh Ravindran, implies Sajan was trying to save those whom his junior, range forest officer Sameer M.K., had nailed for illegal felling in Muttil South village in Wayanad. Ravindran says the regional head of News24 Malayalam channel, Deepak Dharmadam, deliberately played up Sajan’s false case about felling in Manikunnumala, part of the same Meppadi forest range in Wayanad. “They (the Muttil accused) orchestrated the whole episode to perfection and through Shri Deepak Dharmadam got to Shri N.T. Sajan using his office to their benefit in threshing a story the way they wanted it scripted,” Ravindran’s 18-page report, leaked to the media on Wednesday, says. Three timber merchants — brothers Roji Augustine, Anto Augustine and Josekutty Augustine — were arrested in late July in connection with the Muttil felling. But the government ignored Ravindran’s recommendation of disciplinary action against Sajan and, instead, transferred him to Kollam on August 9, inviting criticism from the Opposition. Deepak posted a Facebook picture of himself with Vijayan at the recent Onam lunch at the chief minister’s home, fuelling further controversy. The channel suspended him after Ravindran’s report was leaked on Wednesday. It had all begun with a state government order in October 2020 allowing owners of land on forest fringes — mostly tribal people — to cut any tree barring sandalwood. The timber mafia saw their chance and allegedly felled hundreds of trees, estimated to be worth at least Rs 15 crore, in Muttil South between October 2020 and February 2021, when the government revoked the order. Villagers complained to Sameer the mafia had cut down more trees than agreed — while paying them much less per tree than promised — and even felled trees on public land deeper within the forest. In February, Sameer banned the transport of whatever felled logs remained in Muttil, and confiscated 54 rosewood logs that had been ferried to a sawmill in Ernakulam, 250km away, in violation of his order. According to Ravindran, Sajan ignored the matter and, instead, cited “secret” information to begin an inquiry into the fictitious logging of teakwood in Manikunnumala — apparently to discredit Sameer whose is assigned to protect the entire forest range. Just an hour after Sajan informed divisional forest officer P. Dhanesh Kumar about the Manikunnumala investigation on February 10, Deepak called Kumar and asked him “to immediately launch an inquiry” into the matter, Ravindran’s report says. It says there’s no substance to the Manikunnumala case. It adds that call data records show Deepak had called Roji and Anto Augustine 107 times while Sajan called them 86 times between February 1 and March 31. In a Facebook message, quoted by channels, Deepak has said: “I have not supported any corruption.” Sajan has not been available to the media for comments. When the media got wind of the Muttil South scam in June and began playing it up, the state government directed the inquiry by Ravindran and also started a police probe by a special investigative team. The SIT arrested the Augustine brothers in July. On Thursday, leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan accused the chief minister of intervening to save Sajan. “The forest minister (A.K. Saseendran) had told the Assembly and me personally that he would take action. But the chief minister rejected the order,” he told The Telegraph. “A senior forest officer committed a crime to frame his upright subordinate. Yet the chief minister is silent and continues to protect the corrupt.” Environmentalist C.R. Neelakandan said Deepak’s picture with Vijayan reflected how well connected he was. “One must realise that the chief minister invited him to the Onam lunch even after his name cropped up in Ravindran’s report,” he said. CPM state committee member A.K. Balan said the government would not protect anyone found guilty in the scandal.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-271
27-08-2021||India||Civil liberties defenders issue legal notices to CMs on migrants’ aid||Three civil liberties defenders have issued legal notices to all chief ministers, telling them contempt proceedings would be sought against them if they failed to comply in two weeks with a Supreme Court order to supply free rations and other basic amenities to migrant labourers hit by the pandemic. Anjali Bhardwaj, Harsh Mander and Jagdeep Chhokar have also addressed a separate letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, reminding him of the Centre’s duty to comply with the court’s directives and pointing to the immense suffering of the migrant and unorganised sector workers. The activists alleged that although the top court had on June 29 issued a slew of directives, including putting in place updated official websites mentioning the measures and facilities available to migrant labourers, neither the states nor the Centre had complied with the July 31 deadline. The top court had asked the Centre and the states to ensure food and social security for migrant workers and unorganised workers, the sections hit the hardest by the pandemic. The court had directed the state governments to implement a scheme by July 31 to provide dry rations to migrant workers as long as the Covid-19 pandemic continued, in addition to offering them cooked food through community kitchens. The notice sent to each individual chief minister by Bhardwaj, Mander and Chhokar stated: “We have perused the website of the food department of the state government and have been unable to locate any information with respect to the formulation and implementation of any such scheme for provision of dry rations to migrant workers pursuant to the Supreme Court’s judgment, even though the prescribed timeframe given by the Court has expired. “By this notice, I therefore call upon you to formulate and implement a scheme for distribution of dry ration to migrant labourers immediately and certainly within the next two weeks, failing which we will be constrained to approach the Court for contempt proceedings against the state government. In case the government has put in place such a scheme, kindly place the details of the same in the public domain and also share them with us via post and/or email.” The legal notices were sent on August 18 through advocate Prashant Bhushan. In the letter addressed to Prime Minister Modi, dated August 16, the activists pointed to Para 80(i) of the apex court directive of June 29: “It is directed that the Central Government develop the Portal in consultation with the National Informatics Centre (NIC) for registration of the unorganised labourers/ migrant workers. We also impress upon and direct that the Central Government as well as the respective States and the Union Territories complete the process of Portal for registration under National Database for Unorganised Workers (NDUW Project) as well as implement the same, which by all means may commence not later than 31.07.2021.” The court had also said, as quoted in the activists’ letter to the Prime Minister: “We also impress upon and direct that the process of registration of the unorganised labourers/migrant workers is completed at the earliest, but not later than 31.12.2021. All the concerned States/Union Territories and the Licence Holders/Contractors and others to cooperate with the Central Government to complete the process of registration of migrant workers and unorganised labourers so that the benefits of the welfare schemes declared by the Central Government/ State Governments/ Union Territories be available to migrant workers and unorganised labourers for whose benefits the welfare schemes are declared.” These measures are crucial to ensure the food and social security of migrants and informal sector workers, “who are the backbone of the economy”, the activists wrote. “They have suffered immensely during the first two waves of Covid-19 on account of loss of livelihoods, health crisis and exclusion from the social security net. Their meagre savings have been exhausted in coping with the crisis and many have gone into debt. It is imperative that the directions of the SC be operationalised on an urgent footing and details of the same be placed in the public domain. We hope that your government will immediately take concrete steps to ensure welfare of migrant and informal sector workers by implementing the directives of the apex court,” the letter to Modi stated.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-271
27-08-2021||India||Bihar police gets 596 women sub-inspectors||Bihar police on Thursday got 1,605 sub-inspectors, including 596 women sub-inspectors, after they passed out of the police training academy at Rajgir in the presence of chief minister Nitish Kumar. This is the largest ever induction of officers in the state. Congratulating the new officers and pointing out the high number of women sub-inspectors to pass out in this batch, Nitish asserted that it was not an ordinary achievement. “Having 596 women police officers passing out among the sub-inspectors today is not an ordinary thing. We started with reserving 50 per cent seats in panchayati raj institutions for women and worked further for their education, welfare and development. It has started paying now,” Nitish said at the passing out parade. The chief minister also said that Bihar has paid special attention to recruiting women in the police force, and no other state in the country has them in such large numbers. Asked about the number of women in Bihar police, DIG personnel Ranjeet Kumar Mishra told The Telegraph that it would not be possible to give their numbers offhand. “However, there are 18 to 20 per cent women in the 80,000 strong police force. The numbers have increased sharply over the last few years due to the state government police recruiting more women to the force and also reserve 35 per cent seats for them,” he said. Remembering the condition of law and order, and the police at the time when he came to power in 2005, Nitish said that the police stations had no vehicles and adequate weapons. “We provided two vehicles to each of the police stations and worked to improve the availability of weapons. We also started recruitment of policemen in the light of the high population of the state,” Nitish said. Bihar has at present over 80,000 policemen, while the state government is working on a plan to recruit 20,000 more. The target is to take their numbers to 1.40 lakh over the next couple of years. “Bihar’s population is high so the police force should also be more in numbers to ensure a better environment and the rule of law. We cannot say that crime will not happen, but swift action should be taken to deal with it,” Nitish said. He also wished that an atmosphere of peace, love and harmony prevailed in the state. He also asked the new officers to work for the successful implementation of prohibition. He dwelt for long on the necessity to enforce the ban on liquor properly. This is what senior serving and retired police officers in the state feared. They are of the opinion that the entire police force’s focus is on prohibition leading to the neglect of attention on controlling other types of more serious offences like murder, rape, robbery and kidnapping. A former director general of police (DGP), who retired during the Nitish regime, told this newspaper on the condition of anonymity, “The entire police force seems to have become directionless and the policing has gone awry. It is indulged in either conducting raids to seize liquor or to compromise prohibition. As a result we see that heinous crimes have risen sharply in the state. Murders are happening as frequently as people use expletives here.” “The chief minister’s emphasis on prohibition in his address at the passing out parade was uncalled for as it would leave an unwanted impression on the brains of these new officers that their foremost duty is to implement prohibition. Agreed that liquor is banned in the state, but there are more serious crimes that need to be curbed,” the former DGP said. The crime data maintained by the Bihar police reveals that the state witnessed 1,399 murders, 749 rapes, 1,369 incidents of robbery and dacoity, 1,078 road robbery, 5,089 kidnappings and 3,413 riots, 17,962 thefts, and 1,918 burglaries out of total 1.32 lakh cognizable offences (registered at the police stations) in the six months between January and June this year. The crime figures surprise all the more because the state also had lockdowns of various intensities between April and June this year. It is also a well-known fact that many crimes go unreported as people avoid approaching the police.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-271
27-08-2021||India||Servitors of Puri Shree Jagannath temple to get homestead land||Each of the servitors of Puri Shree Jagannath temple will be given 600sqft of homestead land in the holy town and monetary assistance of Rs 2 lakh to construct their houses on the assigned plots. The decision was taken at a meeting of the management committee of the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) on Thursday. The meeting was chaired by the scion of the Puri royal family, Gajapati Dibya Singha Deb. Briefing mediapersons about the decision, chief administrator of the 12th century temple Dr Krishan Kumar said: “In the first phase 400 servitor families will be accommodated in eight acres. Each family will be given Rs 2 lakh for constructing the house on a 600sqftplot. They can invest more for construction and expansion of their houses.” The temple administration will invite applications from the servitors who are innately associated with the daily rituals of the deities. It has planned to give land to all the servitors associated with the rituals of the deities. In order to give quality education to the children of the servitors, the SJTA has also decided to set up Shreemandir Gurukul. “A Shreemandira Adarsh Gurukul Society will be formed with the Gajapati Dibya Singha Deb as its chairman and eminent personalities as the members to run the gurukul,” Kumar said. Officials said 17 acres have been identified at Matitola for setting up the gurukul. The state government will provide Rs 20 crore for this purpose. “The gurukul will start functioning from the 2022-23 academic year,” Kumar said. The temple administration will also urge devotees to donate funds to Shreemandir Gurukul. Sources said the state government has also initiated the process of selling more than 60,000 acres belonging to the temple located in different parts of the country. “We plan to enhance the corpus fund from the existing Rs 650 crore to Rs 1,000 crore by 2023 by selling land of the Lord and generating revenues from different sources. The temple administration has so far identified 60,426.943 acres belonging to the temple. Of this, 395.252 acres is located outside Odisha in other states,” officials said. The wheels of the Rath Yatra chariots of the deities will be given free to devotees. “A sub-committee will decide to whom the wheels will be given,” officials said. In another important development, the temple administration has decided to ask the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to formulate an integrated five-year plan for the repair and reconstruction work of the temple. “Both the ASI and SJTA will work in this direction and if required the state will also bear the cost of the repair work in the temple,” Kumar said. The shrine is an ASI protected monument and the agency has been in charge of its conservation since 1975. Meanwhile, the state government has decided to resume work on the Shree Jagannath Heritage Corridor project from September. The project aims at beautification around the shrine and intends to provide an unobstructed path around the wall of the temple. A 75-metre corridor is being developed around the shrine.

District magistrate Ravindra Kumar on Thursday said he had forwarded the proposal to the additional chief secretary, panchayati raj, and a decision would be taken “at the government level”. Asked whether the block will also be renamed, the DM said currently only a proposal to rechristen the village panchayat had been sent to the government. “When the name of the panchayat is changed, the name of the block will also change,” he said. The DM has referred to a letter of BJP MLA Bamba Lal Diwakar demanding the renaming of the panchayat. The MLA had also claimed at a rally during the 2017 Assembly polls that Yogi Adityanath had promised to rename the panchayat. The name-change resolution was passed at an open meeting of the village panchayat on August 16 under the chairmanship of village head Nagma. The state government has already received proposals to rename Aligarh as Harigarh, Firozabad as Chandra Nagar and Mainpuri as Mayan Nagar. Deoband’s BJP MLA Brijesh Singh has demanded renaming of the place as Devvrand. Earlier, the Uttar Pradesh government had renamed Faizabad as Ayodhya, Allahabad as Prayagraj and Mugalsarai as Deen Dayal Upadhyay Nagar. It recently renamed the Jhansi railway station after Rani Laxmi Bai. The Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls are due next year.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-272
27-08-2021||India||Supreme Court ripples block UP bid to drop case against Umesh Malik||A special court here on Thursday rejected a plea by the Uttar Pradesh government to withdraw a case filed against BJP MLA Umesh Malik, citing the Supreme Court’s order that no prosecution against an MP or an MLA would be dropped without the permission of the high courts. Malik, the MLA of Budhana in Muzaffarnagar district, surrendered in the court on Thursday and sought recall of the non-bailable warrant issued against him. Police had registered a case against several people, including the MLA, under IPC Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) and 149 (unlawful assembly), among others, following a demonstration outside a meat factory off Jansath road in the district in 2006. The state had sought to withdraw the case on February 22. On the basis of the apex court’s order, Judge Gopal Upadhyay rejected the Uttar Pradesh government’s application to withdraw the case filed against Malik. As many as 77 cases related to the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots have been withdrawn by the Yogi Adityanath government, the Supreme Court had been informed on Wednesday. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court had held that state prosecutors cannot withdraw prosecution against lawmakers under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) without prior sanction from high courts. The apex court’s order assumed significance in view of the fact, highlighted by an amicus curiae on the basis of news reports, that states like Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra and Karnataka have sought to withdraw criminal cases against politicians by using Section 321 of the CrPC that empowers prosecutors to withdraw cases.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-272
27-08-2021||India||MP: Private schools to stage protests from Sept 2 to demand resumption of physical classes||At least 45,000 private schools affiliated to the Madhya Pradesh Board of Secondary Education will stage sit-ins across the state from September 2 to demand reopening of schools for all classes in compliance with Covid-19 safeguards. The Madhya Pradesh Private School Association wants schools to reopen for all classes with a standard operating procedure in place immediately, president of the association Ajeet Singh said on Thursday. “The association will not suspend online or physical classes for students of Classes IX to XII held on different days in a week,” Singh said. He further demanded that the state government pay the dues of private schools that have provided education to unprivileged children under Right to Education. “The state government has not paid dues accumulated under the RTE in the last three years.” Among other demands, private schools want the state government to immediately scrap the annual renewals of recognition of schools. “We are being asked to pay around Rs 20,000 annual school recognition renewal fees. We have already suffered huge losses because of the pandemic and are not in a position to pay school recognition renewal fees,” Singh said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-272
27-08-2021||India||Covid: Kerala’s low mortality rate has lessons for Modi government||Vilified by the BJP for its high Covid-19 cases, Kerala’s apparent poor record may actually hold crucial lessons for the country in containing the outbreak as authorities brace for a possible third wave of infections. The Left-ruled, densely populated southern state is currently reporting the most number of coronavirus cases in the country and accounts for the second-highest national tally — unflattering headline numbers that the BJP has seized upon as a reflection of bungled local leadership. However, a Reuters analysis of national and state data, and interviews with epidemiologists and Kerala health authorities paint a different picture. It shows the state’s containment measures have helped to catch infections early, allowing authorities to better manage the illness and dramatically lower the death rate — a stark contrast to people dying in carparks and outside hospitals for lack of oxygen and beds in big cities like Delhi at the height of the health crisis a few months earlier. “While the central government may have its views on rapid antigen tests, it is important to consider that the state’s strategies have by and large succeeded in not just keeping mortality low but also in being able to detect one in six cases compared to one in 33 nationally,” said Rajib Dasgupta, head of the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health at JNU. The efficient detection rate and its population density at more than twice the national average explain the high number of cases in Kerala. All the same, at 0.5 per cent, Kerala still has the lowest fatality rate among all but one thinly populated state. The national figure is 1.4 per cent and it is 1.3 per cent for the country’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. The difference comes down to Kerala’s reliance on rapid antigen tests to detect and strictly isolate infected people at home, an approach the Union health ministry has sharply criticised but which state officials argue has helped them to better allocate hospital beds and oxygen supplies for those who really need them. The government-recommended RT-PCR tests are more accurate but take longer to produce results, meaning by the time a positive Covid-19 case is confirmed the infected person is more likely to have developed severe symptoms and passed it on to others in a vicious cycle of more infections and deaths. Kerala’s rapid test results allow for early treatment in home isolation, which then narrows the virus’s path to infections, state officials say. These factors, along with the strained medical resources across much of India, largely explain why the overall national death rate is much higher than in Kerala. Kerala officials also say a state-run support service that includes phone consultation, provision of drugs and pulse oximeters that detect blood oxygen levels for people recovering at home provide a bulwark in the battle against the disease. Delhi had a similar support structure but it collapsed when cases surged. “We do have a different model and our fatality rate shows our model is on the right track,” Kerala health minister Veena George told Reuters. But Kerala officials acknowledge that the fast-evolving pandemic can undo even the best thought-out plans unless authorities remain nimble and flexible. When Reuters recently visited Kerala’s most populous Malappuram district, which is reporting the greatest number of infections in India, a quarter of the 344 Covid beds in its biggest hospital were vacant and oxygen supply was ample. The Indian Council of Medical Research has recommended lockdowns for districts where more than 10 per cent of the tests return positive results. The rate is over 19 per cent for Kerala and even higher in Malappuram, but shops and restaurants are open for business. Kerala officials argue that they are able to keep businesses open as the state has the best testing rate among Indian states — 86 tests per 100 people, compared with about 33 in Uttar Pradesh — meaning Kerala is able to catch infections early and ensure timely treatment. The model, epidemiologists say, can be replicated in a few other states with good health facilities, such as neighbouring Tamil Nadu. “Their surveillance is good, they detect cases early and their testing is very focused,” M.D. Gupte, a retired director of the National Institute of Epidemiology who advises the Centre on immunisations, said about Kerala. “Most people in Kerala are educated, so that helps.” India’s daily demand for medical oxygen jumped more than eight times in May from pre-pandemic levels, but Kerala avoided major shortages of hospital beds and oxygen that crippled many states when nationwide infections saw an explosive surge. The Union health ministry did not respond to emails requesting comment. Minister George said Kerala was on course to administer at least one vaccine dose to all adults by next month, the fastest pace among all states. Currently, the state has covered more than 55 per cent of adults with at least one vaccine dose, compared with 48 per cent for the whole of India, which wants to vaccinate all its adults by December. Kerala, with 35.5 million people, has so far reported 3.8 million infections, or 12 per cent of India’s total of 32.5 million. Its 19,757 deaths, however, account for only 4 per cent of the overall nationwide fatalities. The Indian government recommends 70 per cent of all Covid-19 tests be carried out by the RT-PCR method, while Kerala’s rate is less than 50 per cent. “This is not the Kerala model, this is a model of mismanagement,” BJP president J.P. Nadda, said last week. He said BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh had better managed the pandemic, though A government survey estimated in July that more than 70 per cent residents of BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh had been exposed to the virus. The figure was 44 per cent for Kerala. Kerala’s Covid-19 hospitalisation rate is only about 3 per cent, a state official said, compared with more than 5 per cent nationwide. T.S. Anish, a member of Kerala’s Covid Expert Committee, said the state was now focused on vaccination. “If you are able to vaccinate large numbers, you will get infections but your health system will not be overwhelmed.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-272
27-08-2021||India||Madras HC says no to EWS reservation for medical colleges||Madras High Court has put on hold the implementation of the 10 per cent reservation for economically weaker sections (EWS) in all-India pool seats in state medical colleges and asked the Centre to approach the Supreme Court. P. Wilson, the lawyer who fought the DMK’s contempt plea against the delay in the Centre’s implementation of the 2020 Madras High Court order against setting aside seats for the EWS category within the all-India poll, said the judgment would be applicable all over India. “The judgment is not limited to Tamil Nadu. In no state can the EWS quota be implemented in the all-India pool seats,” Wilson said. An official in the Union social justice ministry said the Centre was studying the judgment. The bench of Madras High Court Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu said in its order on Wednesday: “The inclusion of a further 10 per cent by way of vertical reservation for economically weaker sections would require the approval of the Supreme Court and, to such extent, the reservation for economically weaker sections as indicated in the (central) notification of July 29, 2021, has to be regarded as impermissible till such approval is obtained.” Quotas for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) is referred to as vertical reservation. The high court directed the Centre to go to the Supreme Court as the top court had set the quota formula related to the all-India pool seats. Under the all-India pool, 15 per cent seats are set aside in undergraduate courses and 50 per cent in postgraduate courses. The central government had on July 29 decided to implement 27 per cent reservation for OBCs within the all-India pool and 10 per cent for EWS students. However, Madras High Court had on July 27 last year allowed the Centre to implement the OBC quota in the all-India pool and made no such provision for the EWS category. Had the Centre’s move on the EWS been cleared, 550 students from the category would have benefitted in the MBBS course and 1,000 in the postgraduate courses. The all-India pool in state medical colleges was introduced in 1986, but did not have any reservation provision till 2007. In 2007, the Supreme Court introduced reservation of 15 per cent for Scheduled Castes and 7.5 per cent for Scheduled Tribes in this category. The court agreed in principle to set aside seats for the OBCs within this pool from 2021-22 on a plea by Tamil Nadu parties last year. “The notification of July 29, 2021, issued by the Union as a consequence of the (Madras High Court) order dated July 27, 2020, appears to be in order insofar as it provides for reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and OBCs. The horizontal reservation provided in such notification for persons with disabilities also appears to be in accordance with law,” Wednesday’s Madras High Court judgment said. Wilson, the advocate and DMK leader, said seats should have been reserved for OBCs too in the all-India pool in 2007 when the benefit was allowed to SCs and STs. “Such a quota would have benefited 56,000 OBC students (across India),” he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-272
