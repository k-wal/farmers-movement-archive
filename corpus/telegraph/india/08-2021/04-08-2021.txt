The BRO has constructed a 52-km long black-topped road through Umlingla Pass, bettering the previous record of a road in Bolivia connecting to its volcano Uturuncu at 18,953 ft, the ministry's statement noted.  The road at Umlingla Pass now connects the important towns in the Chumar sector of Eastern Ladakh, it said.  "It will prove to be a boon to the local population as it offers an alternate direct route connecting Chisumle and Demchok from Leh. It will enhance the socio-economic condition and promote tourism in Ladakh," it mentioned.  During the winter, the temperature dips to -40 degrees Celsius and the oxygen level at this altitude (19,300 feet) is almost 50 per cent less than at normal places, it stated.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-353

04-08-2021||India||Covid: Centre asks states to impose local restrictions during festivals||States should consider restrictions in view of the coming festive season, the Centre said today pointing to the upsurge in cases in parts of the country. Pointing to the festivities starting with Muharram on August 19 to Durga Puja on October 15, the Union health ministry said the states should "actively consider local restrictions" and "curb mass gatherings". "Indian Council of Medical Research and National Centre for Disease control have expressed concern regarding the mass gathering events during festivals turning into super spreader events," added the letter from the health ministry to Chief Ministers and administrators of all states. "I would like to reiterate that any laxity in ensuring strict adherance to the five-fold strategy of 'Test-Track-Treat-Vaccinate and Ensuring Covid-Appropriate Behaviour', may result in losing the impetus that our country has gained so far in managing the pandemic," read the letter signed by Rajesh Bhushan. The Centre has repeatedly warned that the second wave is still not over and the Delta variant of the virus is still a dominant problem. Till yesterday, 8 states reported an "R-factor"--- reproductive rate of a virus which indicates how infectious it is ---- of more than 1. An R factor above 1 indicates that the infection rate is increasing and needs to be controlled. The R-factor -- used worldwide to gauge the trajectory of the coronavirus -- is above 1 at Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Lakshadweep, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Karnataka, Puducherry and Kerala. In Bengal, Nagaland, Haryana, Goa, Delhi and Jharkhand the R-factor stands at 1. The growing trend is causing much concern in view of a possible third wave of the virus. Last year, a surge in the pandemic took place during the festive season, when the daily number of fresh cases had just stopped short of 3 lakh. During the second wave -- driven by the Delta variant -- in summer, the daily figure of fresh cases had gone above 4 lakh, bringing the country's healthcare system to its knees.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-354
04-08-2021||India||Arvind Kejriwal criticises Baijal's Covid meet directly with officials||The Delhi government has criticised the Lieutenant Governor for holding a meeting on Covid-19 directly with officials "behind the back of an elected government". A tweet by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to this effect is likely to aggravate rocky ties between the Aam Aadmi Party government and Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal over blurry lines on how best to run the national capital. "It is against the Constitution and Supreme Court judgement to hold such parallel meetings behind the back of an elected government. We are democracy. People have elected a Council of Ministers. If you have any questions, please ask your ministers. Avoid holding direct meetings with officers. Let's respect democracy, sir," Kejriwal replied to a tweet by the Lt Governor's office showing photos of him meeting Delhi officials over the Covid situation. The Kejriwal government has been particularly offended by an amended law on governing the national capital, which cleared parliament in March this year, as in its view the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) or GNCTD Act gave more powers to the Lt Governor - the centre's representative in Delhi - compared to the city's elected government. The centre maintained the amended law would further define the responsibilities of the elected government and the Lt Governor in line with the constitutional scheme of governance, as interpreted by the Supreme Court. A blurry line of responsibilities has been the biggest point of conflict between the Lt Governor's office and the Aam Aadmi Party government ever since it came to power in the national capital in 2013. Kejriwal had called the amendment to the GNCTD Act an "insult" to the people of Delhi. In today's tweet, the Lt Governor said, "Reviewed the COVID-19 situation in Delhi and future preparedness with Chief Secretary, ACS (Home and Health), Divisional Commissioner, Secretary (Health), MD-DMRC and other officials concerned." Among other measure, Baijal asked officers to ensure all liquid oxygen plants are made functional and media oxygen storage tanks are kept in top shape at least by the end of this month. Steps to ensure enough buffer stock of medicines for Covid and Black Fungus were discussed. "Concern was expressed regarding reported violation of Covid appropriate behaviour in Metro and other means of public transport," the Lt Governor tweeted.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-354

Rapid antigen tests at private facilities will cost Rs 300. In a tweet, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, "Delhi government drastically reduces corona test rates. This will help the common man." According to the order, home collection of samples and testing would cost Rs 700. Earlier, it was Rs 1,200. At government centres and hospitals, RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests are conducted for free. In November last year, the government had capped the rate of RT-PCR tests in private hospitals and labs at Rs 800. The health department has directed all private hospitals and laboratories to display the revised rates at a prominent place within 24 hours. It has also asked the private facilities to process samples, share reports with clients and update results on the ICMR portal within 24 hours. On Tuesday, Delhi reported 50 COVID-19 cases and four more fatalities due to the viral disease, while the positivity rate stood at 0.08 per cent. The national capital has reported 14,36,451 COVID-19 cases so far.

The man was also accused of posing as MLA Jayanta Malla Baruah and extorting money from people, a senior officer said. A complaint was lodged by Sandeep Jalan at the Bhangagarh Police Station, alleging that a person impersonating as the legislator had demanded Rs 30 lakh from him. The police initiated a probe into the allegation and registered a case against the accused, identified as Navadeep Sharma. A preliminary investigation suggested that Sharma had saved his phone number as that of the MLA in a caller identification application to dupe people and extort money on the pretext of providing them jobs in various departments, the officer said. During the interrogation, the arrested person admitted that he has so far cheated five persons by alluring them with government jobs.

Gandhi on Wednesday met the family of the nine-year-old girl and asserted that he is with them on the path to justice and "will not back down even an inch". Later, he posted a picture of his meeting with the girl's parents on Twitter and wrote in Hindi, "Parents' tears are saying only one thing -- their daughter, the daughter of this country, deserves justice. And I am with them on this path to justice." The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights sent a letter to the resident grievance officer of Twitter, saying it received a complaint that a photo of the victim's family has been posted on the Twitter handle @Rahul Gandhi with the caption stating that they are the father and the mother of the child. "In the said photo, the faces of the victim's father and mother can be seen which thereby reveals the identity of the girl," the apex child rights body said. "Therefore, posting of the photo of the minor victim's family on the said Twitter handle has been observed by the commission to be a violation of Section 74 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, Section 23 of the POCSO Act, 2012, Section 228A of the IPC and the guidelines of the Hon'ble court as well," it said. Accordingly, the complaint is being forwarded for appropriate action against the Twitter handle... and removal of the tweet from the platform, it said. The NCPCR requested that an action-taken report in the matter may be sent to the Commission within three days. The move comes shortly after BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra accused Gandhi of violating the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and another law dealing with juveniles by tweeting a picture of the girl's parents as disclosing any aspect of a rape victim's identity is an offence. Patra urged the NCPCR to take cognisance of the matter and issue notice to the Congress leader. Section 74 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, prohibits disclosure of the identity of children while Section 23 of the POCSO Act, 2012, lays out the procedure for media coverage of such cases and Section 228 of the IPC prohibits publishing the identity of sexual assault and rape victim. The girl died under mysterious circumstances when she went to get water from a cooler at a crematorium Old Nangal area in southwest Delhi. The girl's parents alleged that she was raped and her body was forcibly cremated by a crematorium priest who had falsely claimed that she was electrocuted. Hundreds of locals, including the victim's parents, have been staging a protest near the site of the incident, demanding capital punishment for the convicts. Police had on Monday said that based on the statement of the victim's mother, rape charges have been added in the FIR. Four people, including the priest, have been arrested. The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) has launched an inquiry into the incident.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-354

The Indian military has been traditionally wary of antagonising China but the mood has hardened following clashes between troops on the disputed land border last year. The government has since drawn closer to the United States in efforts to push back against China. Four ships including a guided missile destroyer and a missile frigate will be deployed for a two-month period to southeast Asia, the South China Sea and the western Pacific, the navy said in a statement. "The deployment of the Indian Navy ships seeks to underscore the operational reach, peaceful presence and solidarity with friendly countries towards ensuring good order in the maritime domain..." the navy said. The South China Sea has become one of many flashpoints in the testy relationship between China and the United States, with Washington rejecting what it calls unlawful territorial claims by Beijing in the resource-rich waters. In June, a U.S. aircraft carrier group led by the USS Ronald Reagan entered the South China Sea as part of a routine mission and a British carrier group is due to undertake exercises in the Philippine Sea this month. As part of their deployment, the Indian ships will take part in annual joint war drills involving the United States, Japan and Australia off the coast of Guam, the navy said. The four countries make up the Quad, an informal group, that U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is promoting as a way to counter an assertive China. "These maritime initiatives enhance synergy and coordination between the Indian Navy and friendly countries, based on common maritime interests and commitment towards Freedom of Navigation at sea," the Indian navy said in its statement. China has in the past criticised multilateral military manoeuvres as destabilising to the region.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-354

Rawat was talking to reporters here on the sidelines of the party's three-day 'chintan shivir' to evolve a strategy for the state assembly polls due early next year. "Winnability of candidates and their unflinching loyalty to the party will be the two deciding factors for distributing tickets," Rawat said in reply to a question. The former chief minister was recently made the president of the party's campaign committee in a major organisational rejig ahead of the next year's elections. It also saw Ganesh Godiyal taking over from Pritam Singh as the new PCC president. Making a reference to the Hindu mythology in which churning of the ocean had led to the discovery of 'amrit', Rawat said the deliberations at the party's 'chintan shivir' will definitely lead to something significant. "The party will become more vocal in the coming days on issues like unprecedented rise in prices of essential commodities, growing unemployment, plight of farmers and the wrong policies of the Centre which have made the life of the common man miserable," he said. In-charge of the party's manifesto committee Nav Prabhat and spokesman Surya Kant Dhasmana presented and debated points to be included in the party's manifesto for the coming polls during Wednesday's session. The 'chintan shivir' is being attended by all party leaders, including Rawat, newly appointed state Congress president Godiyal and state party in-charge Devendra Yadav.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-355

Wilson has moved the high court seeking quashing of the charges against him. His petition has cited, among other grounds, a report of the US-based digital forensic firm Arsenal Consulting that incriminating evidence was planted on his computer through a malware before he was arrested. On Wednesday, his lawyer, senior counsel Indira Jaising told a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar that to tamper with a person's electronic device was an offense under the Information Technology (IT) Act. "It is my case that crimes under the IT Act have been committed against me....I have come with a positive case that my device was tampered with and an expert should be appointed to ascertain if my computer had malware when it was seized (by the National Investigation Agency)," she said. "The expert can tell how the malware was planted," she added. As per Arsenal Consulting, a hacker had had the control of Wilson's computer, and a malware (software used for malicious purposes such as spying) was used to plant documents in it, including a letter that was cited by the NIA as evidence against Wilson and other accused in the case. Arsenal came out with more reports later, claiming that electronic devices of other accused, including Jesuit priest Stan Swamy who died in hospital last month, too had been tampered with. Shoma Sen, another accused in the case, too has filed a petition seeking quashing of charges on the same ground. Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, who appeared for the NIA, argued on Wednesday that the reports on which the petitioners were relying came from an organization called `American Bar Association'. This association had no standing in India and it was not a statutory body, he said. "We are at the stage of framing of charges. All their contentions can be looked into at the stage of trial," Singh said. Jaising had earlier told the HC that besides deciding on the issue of quashing the charges against Wilson and Sen, the court will also have to examine what could be considered a "legal method of search and seizure of electronic evidence". The hearing will continue later this month.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-355

Replying to a question in the Lok Sabha, Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan also said the India-based personnel from the Indian consulate in Kandahar were temporarily withdrawn last month as part of the security measures. "The security situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated in the recent past. In view of this, the government remains vigilant and is taking all necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of Indian nationals and ongoing projects," he said. Muraleedharan said the Indian embassy in Kabul continues to function normally and is providing regular consular and visa services. "As a security measure in July, India-based personnel from the consulate of India in Kandahar were temporarily withdrawn. However, the consulate continues to operate visa and consular services through its local staff," he said. "Our mission in Kabul also continues to extend necessary assistance to Indian nationals in Afghanistan," the minister said. The Taliban has been making rapid advances across Afghanistan by resorting to widespread violence since the US began withdrawing its troops on May 1. The US has already pulled back the majority of its forces and is looking to complete the drawdown by August 31. To a separate question, he said the government had decided to offer Covid-19 vaccine to foreign personnel working at embassies, consulates and the United Nations offices and other international organisations located in India. "A total of 3,751 such foreign personnel registered with the Ministry of External Affairs for Covid-19 vaccination... They were offered vaccination facilities at any of the vaccination centres in their respective cities," Muraleedharan said. To another question, he said a number of countries, including some neighbouring ones, had signed contracts with Indian manufacturers for procurement of Covid-19 vaccines.

"The data shows an increasing trend in carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions (by the Indian carriers) over the years," Singh stated in his written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha. He gave the details of CO2 emissions by the Indian carriers between 2012 and 2019. Singh stated the Indian carriers had 18,900 thousand tons of CO2 emissions in 2019, which was 11,560 thousand tons in 2012. "The DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation) compiles CO2 emissions data based on the information received from the Indian scheduled carriers," he said. In 2019, domestic flights by the Indian airlines led to 11,843 thousand tons of CO2 emissions, while their international flights led to 7,057 thousand tons of CO2 emissions, he mentioned. In 2012, the Indian carriers' domestic flights had 6,135 thousand tons of CO2 emissions and their international flights had 5,425 thousand tons of CO2 emissions, the minister noted.

04-08-2021||India||Delhi HC: No clarity in buffer stock of oxygen in Centre's report||The Delhi High Court Wednesday said there is no clarity on the steps taken by the Centre for setting up buffer stock of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) in the national capital to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic even as the third wave is anticipated. A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said the status report filed by the Centre does not indicate that buffer stock of LMO is actually created for the use of Delhi and it only talks of enhancement of oxygen storage capacity here. "Today the situation may look fine but then everyone saw what happened in April-May. There is no escape from this (buffer stock of LMO). This is like insurance," the bench said, adding that it has been flagging this issue ever since the Supreme Court passed an order in April. The Supreme Court had passed an order on April 30 directing the Centre and Delhi government to create appropriate buffer stock of LMO in the national capital and the direction is an obligation cast on both the governments, the bench said. "Creation of buffer stock cannot happen in a week or two. You will need to first install the necessary infrastructure for that," it added. The high court was hearing various issues related to the Covid-19 crisis and the next hearing is scheduled for August 23. The bench said if the central government is of the view that it is not required to take any steps on LMO or that sufficient buffer stocks are available in Delhi or if the responsibility shall fall on the Delhi government, it shall approach the Supreme Court whose order is enforceable and the government is bound to comply with it. During the hearing, central government standing counsel Kirtiman Singh said the Delhi government has done enough for creating a buffer stock and the state counsel could elaborate it. Amicus Curaie and senior advocate Raj Shekhar Rao submitted that it was not clear whether buffer stock of LMO exist in Delhi and to what extent. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, said they have a buffer stock of around 420 metric tonnes of LMO kept at different places with the suppliers outside Delhi and by August 31, they will transfer this stock to Delhi. The court was also informed by the Centre that manufacturing capacity of Liposomal Amphotericin B, used for treating patients of black fungus which primarily affects those who have recovered from Covid-19 and was in shortage earlier, has been augmented. The Centre's counsel said the centralised allocation of the medicine to the states has been discontinued and now they will have to procure the drug directly from the manufacturers. The Centre, in a status report, told the court that there has been a fall in the cases of mucormycosis (Black Fungus) which were 28,475 on June 27 to 18,833 on July 30. The issue of shortage of the medicine for treating black fungus was raised by advocate Rakesh Malhotra. According to the Union Health Ministry, mucormycosis or black fungus is a complication caused by a fungal infection. People catch mucormycosis by coming in contact with the fungal spores in the environment. It can also develop on the skin after the fungus enters the skin through a cut, scrape, burn, or other type of skin trauma. The disease is being detected among patients who are recovering or have recovered from Covid-19. Moreover, anyone who is diabetic and whose immune system is not functioning well needs to be on the guard against this, the ministry has said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-355
04-08-2021||India||Senior IPS officer Param Bir Singh moves HC to challenge panel’s summons||Senior IPS officer Param Bir Singh filed a petition in the Bombay High Court on Wednesday challenging an order issued by an inquiry commission, set up by the Maharashtra government to probe into allegations of corruption against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh, directing the former Mumbai police commissioner to appear before it for deposition. Singh in his petition also challenged the legality of the commission's inquiry on the ground that the scope entrusted to the commission has already been adjudicated by the high court and the Supreme Court. In the petition, Singh demanded the HC to declare that the scope entrusted upon the inquiry commission stands adjudicated and therefore, nothing survives to be inquired into by the commission. He also sought for interim reliefs by way of staying the proceedings before the commission and the summons issued to him to appear before it on August 6. The Maharashtra government on March 30 this year constituted a one-member high level inquiry commission headed by former Justice K U Chandiwal to probe into allegations of corruption and misconduct levelled against the then state former home minister and NCP leader Anil Deshmukh. Singh in his petition stated that the commission had to inquire and submit its findings on whether any offence was made out against Deshmukh, as alleged by Singh in his letter to the Maharashtra chief minister on March 20, 2021. He claimed that the high court, in its judgement dismissing a petition filed by Deshmukh seeking to quash the CBI FIR lodged against him, noted that a prima facie cognisable offence was made out against the NCP leader. The petition further said even the order passed on April 5, 2021 by the HC, directing the CBI to carry out a preliminary enquiry against Deshmukh, noted that serious allegations were levelled against him. The April 5 order of the HC was challenged in the Supreme Court by the state government and Anil Deshmukh. The Supreme Court while refusing to intervene was pleased to observe that the nature of allegations, the personas involved and the seriousness of the allegations do require an independent agency to enquire into the matter and that it was a matter of public confidence, Singh said in the petition. It is thus clear the scope entrusted upon the Inquiry Commission has already been adjudicated upon by the Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court. It has been clearly found that the allegations made in the letter of March 20, 2021 reveal the commission of a cognisable offence and are required to be inquired into by an independent investigating agency, it said. The petitioner seeks to raise important legal issues on whether the Inquiry Commission can continue with the inquiry once the scope entrusted to it has already been adjudicated upon by the Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court, the petition said. The petitioner cannot be compelled to depose before the commission and face cross-examination, it added. The petition stated that in May this year, the commission issued summons to Singh and when he failed to appear, a cost was imposed on him on June 22. On July 5, the petitioner paid the costs and also submitted a letter to the registrar of the Inquiry Commission informing that the commission's scope has been adjudicated upon and thus, nothing survives to be inquired into, the plea said. The commission directed Singh to file an affidavit raising these contentions. Singh complied and the commission later sought replies from all other parties on this issue. The Inquiry Commission by its order dated July 30, 2021 rejected the contention of the petitioner and directed for the inquiry to continue. The commission has fixed the next date of hearing on August 6 and directed the petitioner to appear before it for deposition and cross-examination, the plea said. The petition has challenged the July 30 order passed by the commission terming it as illegal and bad in law . Deshmukh had resigned from the post of state home minister in April this year after the HC directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary enquiry into the allegations of corruption levelled against him by Singh. The NCP leader has denied any wrongdoing.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-355
04-08-2021||India||Mask up and get vaccinated, say experts||The rise in fresh Covid cases and the effective reproduction number indication of how fast an infection spreads -- in many states is worrying but don't panic. Instead, mask up and get vaccinated, say experts, stressing that it is too early to declare the beginning of a new wave. In fact, it could be that the second wave is not over, said several scientists who have been closely monitoring India's Covid graph and have noted the surge in a few pockets. In the northeast, for instance, cases have certainly not gone down to the low levels that are being seen in Delhi and other northern states, observed Gautam Menon, professor, Departments of Physics and Biology at Ashoka University in Haryana. "In that sense, we are likely seeing a continuation of the second wave rather than the initiation of a new Covid wave distinct from the previous one," he explained. On Wednesday, India recorded 42,625 fresh Covid cases with a daily positivity rate of 2.31 per cent and a weekly one of 2.36 per cent. India's Covid situation is seemingly under control. However, 13 states/union territories recorded a surge in coronavirus infections last week with Kerala reporting half of India's daily new cases. Last week, Kerala reported 1.4 lakh new Covid-19 cases, around 20,000 more than the previous week. In the week ended August 1, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Mizoram, J&K, Sikkim, and Karnataka also witnessed a rise in cases. With the government warning that the pandemic is still raging, there is also an increase in India's effective reproduction number (R) which represents the number of susceptible people one Covid positive person may infect. A recent analysis by researchers at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, found that the effective R number in India has crossed 1 for the first time since May 7. The government on Tuesday also said the R-value is more than one in eight states and UTs, which is a cause of concern. Researcher Sitabhra Sinha, who has been tracking the value of R since the beginning of the pandemic, is alarmed that this rise is not driven by the increase in cases in any particular region but seems to be resulting from several states having R values greater than 1 roughly around the same time. Apart from Kerala which has had R above 1 for more than a month and the northeastern states where the second wave has not yet subsided after beginning in July, we saw in the past week R increase above 1 in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, and Haryana, and possibly in Uttarakhand, Sinha, from the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, told PTI. The cities of Chennai, Calcutta, Bengaluru, and Delhi also are showing R above 1. This suggests a rise in the active cases that is coordinated across widely scattered regions which would be hard to contain, he added. The need of the hour is to press the accelerator on Covid protocols. We need to be prepared but not overtly panic. It is time people mask up and get vaccinated, Delhi-based physician-epidemiologist and health systems expert Chandrakant Lahariya told PTI, adding that the numbers clearly indicated the need to be cautious. He noted that Covid-19 cases are mostly being reported from states that had succeeded or avoided transmission earlier. Some of this, he said, is attributable to the high transmissibility of the Delta variant. We should not be looking at the proportion contributed by a state of the total new cases reported in India. That is not very helpful as we end up comparing the states with better reporting systems with states with weak disease surveillance systems, the public health expert said. The wave or cycle is of academic significance only. If cases are rising, it does not matter whether that is a continuation of the second wave or the start of the next wave, he said. The interventions have to be very similar. Scientist Gautam Menon agreed that while it is too early to declare the third wave, the surge in cases is certainly worrying. The next few weeks will be critical to see whether the rise in case numbers, currently confined to the south and northeast of India, will spread across other parts of the country where cases have been declining for the past month, Menon told Explaining the rise in cases, Menon said the spike in Kerala can be traced to the relatively low levels of seropositivity there, indicating that much of the state has not undergone a prior infection and should therefore be susceptible.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-355
04-08-2021||India||U'khand CM launches India's first earthquake early warning mobile app ||Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Wednesday launched the country's first earthquake early warning mobile application 'Uttarakhand Bhookamp Alert' developed by IIT Roorkee. Launching the lifeguarding mobile app at the secretariat here, Dhami said considering Uttarakhand's vulnerability to earthquakes, people should be informed about the availability of a mobile application like this. The application is available in two versions, compatible with both Android and iOS platforms. The project was sponsored by the Uttarakhand State Disaster Management Authority (USDMA). It is a path-breaking achievement for the institute as it is the country's first application for notifying people about earthquake alerts. It can also help tell the location of people trapped inside a structure following an earthquake. Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) is a real-time earthquake information system that can detect the onset of the earthquake and issue warnings before the significant tremors take hold of an area, according to a press release by IIT Roorkee. The physical basis for an earthquake early warning system is the speed of the seismic waves, which propagate after the release of stress from faults movement. The strong ground shaking is caused by shear waves which travel at about half the speed of the primary waves and much slower than electromagnetic signals. The EEW system exploits this advantage, it said. The programme was initially launched as a pilot project by the Ministry of Earth Sciences for the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand. Given its success and the need of the region, the IIT Roorkee's EEW project proposal was extended further by the Uttarakhand government. "I take immense pride in sharing that IIT-R has designed an Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) mobile app, for timely dissemination of information regarding an earthquake occurrence in the neighbourhood and the expected time of arrival and intensity at the location to prevent any loss of life," IIT Roorkee director Ajit K Chaturvedi said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-355

However, the Upper House passed the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which seeks to encourage smaller airports to expand air connectivity to relatively remote and far-flung areas. The House passed the bill after a brief discussion amid protest and sloganeering by the opposition over various issues, including the Pegasus snooping controversy and farm laws. The Lok Sabha had passed the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Bill, 2021 on July 29. When the Upper House assembled after a 15-minute adjournment at 2:56 pm, the opposition continued to protest. Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh, who was in the chair, called members for debate on the bill. After a short debate and a brief reply from the Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Bill, 2021 was passed with a voice vote. Immediately after that the deputy chairman adjourned the House till Thursday 11 am. Earlier, the House passed two bills -- the Limited Liability Partnership (Amendment) Bill, 2021 and the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2021 -- after short debates amid the din. As opposition members continued raising slogans, the deputy chairman adjourned the proceedings of the House for 15 minutes till 2.56 pm. He also warned members not to record proceedings on mobile phones as it was against the rules of the Rajya Sabha. Earlier, the proceedings of the House were adjourned till 2 pm as slogan-shouting MLAs of the TMC and other opposition parties trooped into the Well, some holding placards, to demand a discussion on the issue of Pegasus spyware being used to snoop on opposition leaders, government critics and journalists.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-355

04-08-2021||India||Over 1200 Madhya Pradesh villages affected by deluge||The flood situation was "grim" in north Madhya Pradesh where over 1,200 villages were affected by the deluge following heavy rains and 5,950 people were shifted to safer places with the help of the Army, NDRF, BSF and state agencies, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Wednesday. He said 1,950 people were still stranded in the flood-hit areas and efforts were on to rescue them. Rail services between Shivpuri and Gwalior and telecom services in Morena district were badly affected due to the monsoon fury, the CM told reporters. The rescue operations using helicopters resumed again on Wednesday, after being affected due to the bad weather on Tuesday. The CM undertook an aerial survey of the flood-hit areas on Wednesday afternoon. The flood situation in north Madhya Pradesh is grim...1,225 villages in Shivpuri, Sheopur, Datia, Gwalior, Guna, Bhind and Morena districts are affected," Chouhan said. The State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the Indian Army and the BSF together have succeeded in evacuating 5,950 people from 240 villages, he said. "Four columns of the Army, BSF, NDRF teams and 70 teams of the SDRF have been deployed for the rescue work. More teams of the NDRF are coming...five helicopters of the Air Force, including four in Gwalior and one in Shivpuri, have also been pressed into the rescue operations, the CM said. But, it is a matter of relief that the water level is coming down in some places, he said. Some villages in Sheopur district were completely submerged, but the people stranded there were safe. The Army was reaching those villages for the rescue operations, he said. The Army also reached Datia, where 1,100 people were rescued from 36 villages, he informed. Some people were airlifted from a place in Datia districts where all the main roads are shut due to inundation, he said. Two bridges in Datia district collapsed due to flooding. A crack emerged on a bridge over the National Highway no. 3, hence it has been closed as a precaution, he said. Nearly 3,000 people were shifted to relief camps in Gwalior, where 46 villages were affected. In Shivpuri, 800 people were rescued from 22 villages, the CM said. Chouhan further said there was a danger of flooding in Bhind and Morena districts as the water level of the Chambal river was rising due to heavy showers. The level will further go up in these districts as water was released from a barrage over the Chambal river, he said. People from low-lying villages in these districts were being evacuated, he added. Chouhan also said that the infrastructure was completely damaged at several places in these districts. The telecommunication infrastructure in Morena and other places was completely destroyed due to the floods. I have spoken to officials of the Union telecom ministry in this regard, he said. Train services between Shivpuri and Gwalior were halted as the rail infrastructure was badly damaged on the section, he said. Chouhan said he spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday and informed them about the flood situation in the state. Earlier in the day, after holding a meeting with officials in the state capital Bhopal, Chouhan left for Gwalior to undertake an aerial survey of the flood-hit districts.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-356
04-08-2021||India||Citizenship under CAA only after issuance of rules, says Centre||The Centre said on Wednesday that Indian citizenship to the eligible beneficiaries under the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will be given only after rules under the legislation are notified. Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai also said there is no proposal under consideration of the government for any further amendment of the Citizenship Act. Eligible persons covered by the Citizenship Amendment Act may submit applications for grant of citizenship after appropriate rules are notified by the central government, he said in a written reply to a query in Rajya Sabha. He was asked whether the government has received new applications for citizenship after the CAA 2019 was enacted. The CAA was notified on December 12, 2019 and came into force with effect from January 10, 2020, the minister said. "The Committees on Subordinate Legislation, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have been requested to grant further extension of time up to January 9, 2022 to frame the rules under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019," Rai said. The objective of the CAA is to grant Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities like Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis and Christians from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The government got an extension for the fifth time for framing these rules. According to the Manual on Parliamentary Work, the rules for any legislation should be framed within six months of presidential assent or an extension of the time must be sought. Those from the mentioned communities who had come to India till December 31, 2014, facing religious persecution there, will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship. After the CAA was passed by Parliament, widespread protests were witnessed in different parts of the country leading to the death of nearly 100 people in police firing and related violence.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-356
04-08-2021||India||Some Covid deaths may go undetected, but missing out unlikely, says government||The Union Health Ministry on Wednesday clarified that while some Covid-19 cases could go undetected as per the principles of infectious disease and its management, missing out on deaths was completely unlikely given the robust and statute-based death registration system in India. During the peak of the second wave, the health system across the country was focused on effective clinical management of cases requiring medical help due to which correct reporting and recording of Covid deaths could have been delayed but it was later reconciled by states and UTs, the ministry said in a statement. The reconciling of deaths is still being carried out allaying all speculations of under-reporting and under-counting of deaths due to Covid-19, it said. Noting that there have been some speculative media reports inferring under-counting of deaths from eight states, the ministry said the deaths can only be estimated and the exact data may never be known. The reports highlight data from the Civil Registration System (CRS) and Health Management Information System (HMIS), including all-cause death numbers, leading to erroneous inferences terming it as 'counting the uncounted', it said. "It is clarified that given the robust and statute-based death registration system in India, while some cases could go undetected as per the principles of infectious disease and its management, missing out on deaths is completely unlikely. "This could also be seen in the case fatality rate, which as on 31st December 2020 stood at 1.45 per cent, and even after an unexpected surge observed in the second wave in April-May 2021, the case fatality rate today stands at 1.34 per cent," the ministry said. Moreover, the reporting of daily new cases and deaths in India follows a bottom-up approach, where districts report the number of cases and deaths to state governments and to the Union ministry on a continuous basis. As early as May 2020, to avoid inconsistency or confusion in the number of deaths being reported, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had issued 'Guidance for appropriate recording of COVID-19 related deaths in India' for correct recording of all deaths by states and UTs as per ICD-10 codes recommended by the WHO for mortality coding, the ministry said in the statement. The Union Health Ministry has repeatedly been advising states and UTs through formal communications, multiple video conferences and through deployment of central teams for recording of deaths in accordance with laid down guidelines. States have been advised to conduct thorough audits in their hospitals and report any cases or deaths that could have been missed with district and date-wise details so as to guide a data-driven decision-making, it said. The ministry has regularly emphasized the need for a robust reporting mechanism for monitoring district-wise cases and deaths on a daily basis. States consistently reporting lower number of daily deaths have been advised to re-check their data, the statement said. A case in point is the Union Health Ministry writing to the state of Bihar to provide detailed date and district wise break-up of the reconciled number of deaths. "In addition to reporting by states and UTs, the robustness of statute based Civil Registration System (CRS) ensures all births and deaths in the country get registered. The CRS follows process of data collection, cleaning, collating and publishing the numbers, which although is a long-drawn process, but ensures no deaths are missed out. Because of the expanse and the amplitude of the activity, the numbers are usually published the next year, which has also been acknowledged in the referred to media report," the statement said. "It is a well-known fact that there shall always be some differences in mortality recorded during a profound and prolonged public health crisis such as Covid pandemic. Well conducted research studies on mortalities are usually done after the event when data on mortalities are available from reliable sources. The methodologies for such studies are well established, the data sources are defined as also the valid assumptions for computing mortality," it added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-356

In a joint statement here, 18 leaders from 14 parties said it is unfortunate that the government has "unleashed a misleading campaign to malign the combined opposition" and blaming it for the continued disruption of Parliament proceedings. "The responsibility for the deadlock lies squarely at the doorsteps of the government, which remains arrogant and obdurate and refuses to accept the opposition's demand for an informed debate in both the houses," according to the statement. "The opposition once again urges the government to respect parliamentary democracy and accept the discussions. "The opposition parties stand firm and united on their demand for a discussion on Pegasus issue in both the Houses, replied to by the Home Minister, as this has national security dimensions," it said. The Opposition has also unequivocally conveyed that discussion on farmers' issues and on agitations due to the contentious agriculture laws should follow the debate on the Pegasus row. The statement was issued jointly by Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, DMK's T R Balu and Tiruchi Siva, Congress' Anand Sharma, Samajwadi Party's Ramgopal Yadav, Derek O' Brien and Kalyan Banerjee of the Trinamul Congress, and Sanjay Raut and Vinayak Raut of the Shiv Sena. The other signatories included Manoj Jha of the RJD, CPI(M)'s Elamaram Kareem, CPI's Binoy Viswam, AAP's Sushil Gupta, IUML's Mohd. Basheer, NC's Hasnain Masoodi, RSP's NK Premachandran and MV Shreyams Kumar of the LJD. The statement comes after a stalemate in Monsson Session of Parliament with both the Houses paralysed by the Opposition's uproar over their demand for a discussion on the Pegasus snooping issue and farmers' protests. Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday suspended six TMC MPs for the day for carrying placards while protesting along with other Opposition MPs over the Pegasus spying issue. Slogan-shouting TMC and other opposition MPs trooped into the well of the House, some holding placards, to demand a discussion on the issue. Naidu ordered that those "disobeying the chair and raising placards shall leave the House under rule 255." He, however, did not name anyone and said Rajya Sabha Secretariat will give the list. Later a Parliamentary Bulletin identified the six MPs suspended for the day as Dola Sen, Md. Nadimul Haque, Abir Ranjan Biswas, Shanta Chhetri, Arpita Ghosh and Mausam Noor. These "members of the Rajya Sabha who entered the well of the Hosue displayed placards, disobeyed the Chair and whose conduct was grossly disorderly in the House this morning (August 4, 2021) have been directed to withdraw immediately from the Council under rule 255 by the Chairman," it said. The six MPs, it said, "shall absent themselves during the remainder of the day's meeting."||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-356
04-08-2021||India||Bombay High Court reserves verdict on default bail of Elgaar accused||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday reserved its verdict on a default bail plea filed by lawyer-activist Sudha Bharadwaj, an accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case. Opposing her plea, the Maharashtra government told the HC on Wednesday that a sessions court had the power to take cognisance of the charge sheet filed in the case in 2019, since the National Investigation Agency (NIA) was then yet to take over the investigation into the case. The NIA took over the case in January 2020. Appearing for the Maharashtra government, Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni told a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar that as long as the investigation in a case was not assigned to the NIA, the proceedings pertaining to the same could continue before a regular court. Bharadwaj had approached the HC earlier this year, seeking default bail on the ground that Pune additional sessions judge KD Vadane, who had taken cognisance of the police chargesheet in the case filed in 2019, was not authorised to do so. Bharadwaj had annexed RTI (Right to Information) replies from the HC to demonstrate that judge Vadane was not a designated special judge, as was necessary to adjudicate offences under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). Senior counsel Yug Chaudhry, who appeared for Bharadwaj, had earlier told the HC that Vadane pretended to be a special judge and had signed orders as the special judge. On Wednesday, Chaudhry referred to portions of a recent Supreme Court judgement to show that a special court alone has exclusive jurisdiction to try UAPA offences. Kumbhakoni, however, opposed the submission and said Chaudhry was only citing such portions of the judgement that suited his case and not the judgement in its entirety. He said in the case cited above, the circumstances were different from those in Bharadwaj's case. "There are elementary principles of reading a judgement. You cannot read a few paras and say I have succeeded in freeing (someone accused of being involved in) Naxalite activities," Kumbhakoni said. "The facts of every case are different, you can't use one to colour the other," he said. Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, who appeared for the NIA, reiterated that the sessions court had been within its powers in taking cognisance of the case. The HC closed all arguments and reserved its verdict on Bharadwaj's plea. The Elgar Parishad case is related to inflammatory speeches made at a conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which, the police claimed, triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the outskirts of the western Maharashtra city. The police had claimed the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-356
04-08-2021||India||BJP attacks Rahul Gandhi for not speaking on rape cases in Congress-ruled states||The BJP on Wednesday accused Rahul Gandhi of using the case of alleged rape and murder of a Dalit girl in southwest Delhi for "furthering" his political agenda, and asserted that the law and order machinery has moved swiftly to deliver justice to the victim's family. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra told a press conference that his party had no issue with Gandhi, who visited the girl's family earlier, calling for justice but what was condemnable was the Gandhi family's "selectivism" as they never tweeted or spoke a word in the cases of atrocities against Dalit girls in the Congress-ruled states like Rajasthan, Punjab and Chhattisgarh. He also accused Gandhi of violating the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and another law dealing with juveniles by tweeting a picture of the girl's parents as disclosing any aspect of a rape victim's identity is an offence. Patra urged the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights to take cognisance of the matter and issue notice to the Congress leader. "This is using Dalits and the poor for furthering your own political agenda," he said, attacking him. Gandhi had earlier met the family of the nine-year-old Dalit girl who died here following an alleged sexual assault and asserted that he is with them on the path to justice and "will not back down even an inch". After meeting the victim's family, the former Congress chief said the family is demanding nothing but justice and is saying that they are not getting it and need all the assistance in this. Patra cited a number of heinous cases of rapes and other atrocities on Dalit girls and women in Rajasthan, Punjab and Chhattisgarh to hit out at the Congress leader over his "silence". "You close your eyes and open only when you think you will have some political benefit out of it. This is appalling," he said, adding that the Delhi Police has arrested four accused in the case. A Dalit's daughter is certainly India's daughter, the BJP spokesperson said quoting a tweet of Gandhi and shot back to ask if Dalit daughters in these Congress-ruled states are not India's daughters. Rajasthan has topped the country in the cases of rapes, Patra said, citing official figures. The Rajasthan government had blamed registration of false FIRs allegedly by Dalits for the high numbers, he claimed.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-356

The chief minister also announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the family of the girl. "Our girl cannot come back. The injustice done to the family is unfortunate and cannot be compensated, but the government will give Rs 10 lakh to them and order a magisterial inquiry into the matter," he told reporters after meeting the family. "There is a need to strengthen law and order in Delhi. I appeal to the central government to take firm steps in this direction," he said. In a tweet, the chief minister said that the government will appoint top lawyers to ensure the guilty is punished. The parents of the girl accompanied by hundreds of locals were staging a protest near the site of the incident in Old Nangal area in southwest Delhi, demanding capital punishment for the accused. The girl lived with her parents in a rented house in front of a crematorium. On Sunday at around 5.30 PM, she went to get cold water from a cooler at the crematorium after informing her mother, her parents said. Around 6 PM, the crematorium's priest, Radhey Shyam, and two-three other people, known to the girl's mother, called her there and showed her daughter's body claiming that she got electrocuted while getting water from the cooler. There were burn marks between her left wrist and elbow, and her lips were also blue, according to police. It was alleged the priest and the others dissuaded her mother from making a PCR call, saying police will make a case out of it and during the post-mortem, doctors will steal the girl's organs, so it was better to cremate her.

04-08-2021||India||Home ministry recommends action against former CBI chief||The Union home ministry has recommended disciplinary action against former CBI director Alok Verma for allegedly misusing his official position and violating the relevant service rules, officials said on Wednesday. They said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has written to the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), the nodal ministry for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), to take necessary disciplinary action against Verma. The action, if approved, may include temporary or permanent forfeiture of Verma's pension and retirement benefits, the officials said. During his stint in the CBI, Verma, a 1979-batch (retired) Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, was engaged in a bitter fight with Gujarat-cadre IPS officer and his deputy Rakesh Asthana over corruption charges. Both Verma and Asthana had accused each other of corruption. Asthana is the Delhi Police Commissioner now. "Verma has been accused of misusing his official position and violating service rules. Necessary action has been recommended against him by the home ministry," a senior official said, requesting anonymity. The home ministry is the cadre controlling authority for IPS officers. The DoPT has forwarded the MHA's recommendation to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), the recruitment body for IPS officers, the officials said. The UPSC needs to be consulted before imposing penalty on IPS officers, they said. Verma took over as the CBI chief on February 1, 2017 for a fixed two-year tenure. However, he was removed from the post on January 10, 2019 and posted as the director general of Fire Services, Civil Defence and Home Guards -- a less significant portfolio. Verma did not accept the offer and wrote to the government, saying he should be considered as deemed superannuated as he has completed 60 years age of superannuation on July 31, 2017.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-356
04-08-2021||India||ED arrests Avantha Group promoter Gautam Thapar in money laundering case||The Enforcement Directorate has arrested businessman and Avantha Group of companies promoter Gautam Thapar in connection with a money laundering case, officials said on Wednesday. Thapar, 60, was arrested under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on Tuesday night here after the agency carried out raids against him and his linked businesses in Delhi and Mumbai, they said. He is expected to be produced before a court on Wednesday where the ED will seek his custody, they added. The ED has been probing an alleged transaction between his company Avantha Realty, Yes Bank co-founder Rana Kapoor and his wife, who are already being investigated under the PMLA by the agency. The case of money laundering was filed by the ED after taking cognisance of an FIR lodged by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). "The (CBI) FIR alleges that Rana Kapoor, then MD and CEO of Yes Bank Limited, obtained illegal gratification in the form of a property in a prime location in Delhi at much less than the realisable market value belonging to Avantha Reality Ltd for sanction of a loan to ARL and for extending concessions, relaxations and waivers in the already existing credit facilities provided to Avantha Group companies and for advancing new and additional loans to them by Yes Bank Ltd," the ED had said earlier. The CBI had last year booked Kapoor and his wife Bindu for allegedly obtaining a bribe of Rs 307 crore through the purchase of a bungalow in a tony Delhi area from a realty firm at half the market price and facilitating around Rs 1,900 crore bank loans to it in return. The CBI suspected that the discounted transaction for the 1.2 acre-bungalow on Amrita Shergill Marg in Delhi was a gratification to Kapoor through the company Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd in return for non-realisation of over Rs 1,900 crore in loans from Yes Bank to Avantha Realty and group companies. In June, the CBI had booked Thapar and others in a fresh case of fraud of Rs 2,435 crore in the State Bank of India (SBI) and other banks to probe an alleged fraud case at the CG Power and Industrial Solutions.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-356

Noting that the list was prepared after rounds of discussion between him and the national president, and among the national leadership, the Chief Minister said, "there is no question of any one's pressure. It is after comprehensive thinking." On Vijayendra's induction, he said, the national President has spoken to Yediyurappa and the national General Secretary in-charge of Karnataka Arun Singh spoke to Vijayendra personally. "I can only say, Vijayendra's name is not there in the list today." Aimed at giving pro people administration and to face the upcoming elections, this cabinet is being formed under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP National President J P Nadda. The new cabinet will respond to the needs of the people, earn their trust and give a good governance, he said. Noting that there were no confusions regarding the cabinet formation, the Chief Minister said, BJP is a national party with a strong leadership.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-357
04-08-2021||India||Parliament: Chairman Naidu suspends six TMC MPs for the day||Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday suspended six TMC MPs for the day for carrying placards while protesting along with other Opposition MPs over the Pegasus spying issue. Just as witnessed since the start of monsoon session, slogan-shouting TMC and other opposition MPs trooped into the well of the House, some holding placards, to demand a discussion on the issue of Israeli-made, military-grade Pegasus spyware allegedly being used to snoop on Opposition leaders, government critics and journalists. Naidu took exception to the placards, which had anti-government slogans, before adjourning the proceedings of the House till 2 pm. He first asked members to go back to their seats and then threatened to invoke rule 255 against those holding placards. As the members refused to budge, he ordered that those "disobeying the chair and raising placards shall leave the House under rule 255." He, however, did not name anyone and said Rajya Sabha Secretariat will give the list. Later a Parliamentary Bulletin identified the six MPs suspended for the day as Dola Sen, Md. Nadimul Haque, Abir Ranjan Biswas, Shanta Chhetri, Arpita Ghosh and Mausam Noor. These "members of the Rajya Sabha who entered the well of the Hosue displayed placards, disobeyed the Chair and whose conduct was grossly disorderly in the House this morning (August 4, 2021) have been directed to withdraw immediately from the Council under rule 255 by the Chairman," it said. The six MPs, it said, "shall absent themselves during the remainder of the day's meeting." Earlier soon after taking of oath by new member Jawhar Sircar and laying of official documents on the table of the House, Naidu said though he has not admitted notices given under rule 267 by Ramgopal Yadav and Vishambhar Prasad Nishad of the Samajwadi Party and V Sivadasan of the CPI(M) over farmers agitation over three farm laws, a discussion on the issue under a different rule has been admitted. "I have gone through it. It is an ongoing issue but important. So it is admitted for discussion under other provision," he said. A notice under rule 267 calls for setting aside of the business of the day to take up discussion on the issue being raised. Naidu, however, rejected 267 notices by Sukhendu Sekhar Roy (TMC), Mallikarjun Kharge and K C Venugopal (both Congress), CPI(M)'s Elamaram Kareem and V Sivadasan and Binoy Viswam of the CPI over the Peagus issue. "Now there is agreement about farmers' agitation. And also about price rise, economic situation. The government has also expressed willingness to discuss. Let us discuss the farmers' issues. Let us discuss the economic situation, price rise and other issues," he said. Just then TMC and other MPs holding placards rushed into the well. Naidu said this is not the way. "Please go back to your seats." "All these members who are in the well of the House with placards... all of them are named under rule 255. I direct these members who are in the well of the House to go back to their seats, otherwise, you are named and you are suspended for the day," he said. But the MPs refused to budge. "Please obey the chair (and) go back to your seats," he said as opposition MPs shouted, "We want discussion on Pegasus." Naidu then asked for the names of the MPs holding placards. As Rajya Sabha Secretariat started collecting names, Naidu said, "Whoever is in the well, disobeying the chair and then raising these placards, they are all asked to leave the House under rule 255." MPs named under rule 255 have to withdraw from the House proceedings for the rest of the day. "You know what will happen... Secretariat will give the list," he said before adjourning the proceedings till 2 pm. Even after the House proceedings were adjourned, the TMC and other opposition MPs did not leave the House.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-357

04-08-2021||India||Rahul visits family of girl allegedly raped, killed||Congress MP Rahul Gandhi today met the family of the nine-year-old Dalit girl allegedly raped and murdered in Delhi's Cantonment area on Sunday, and whose body was forcibly cremated by her attackers. "I spoke with the family... they want justice and nothing else. They're saying justice is not being given to them and that they should be helped. We will do that. I said 'I am standing with you. Rahul Gandhi is standing with them until they get justice'," Rahul was quoted by news agency ANI. Shortly afterwards he tweeted: "Her parents' tears are saying only one thing - their daughter, the daughter of this country, deserves justice. And I am with them on this path of justice." Rahul tweeted yesterday too, calling her "the nation's daughter" - a pointed reference to accolades for India's women Olympians, who have been widely referred to as "the country's daughters" after their medal-winning exploits. Public fury has exploded over the horrific incident - the latest to spotlight frighteningly high levels of sexual violence in the country - triggering protests by civil society groups and activists, as well as Opposition leaders who have targeted Home Minister Amit Shah (to whom Delhi Police reports). Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Trinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee are among those to have slammed Mr Shah and demand he be held to account for this and other gruesome crimes. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who has called for improvements to the city's law and order situation, is also expected to meet the young girl's family, and has pledged to help seek justice. "The murder of a nine-year-old innocent in Delhi, after subjecting her to brutality, is very shameful. There is a need to improve the law and order situation... the culprits should be given capital punishment at the earliest," Kejriwal tweeted.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-357

In a statement issued on Tuesday, the BMC said the inoculation drive will resume once it receives a fresh stock of vaccines. "Citizens of Mumbai are constantly informed about the vaccination, depending upon the stock of vaccines received, and an appropriate decision is taken," it said. This is the first time that the city civic authority has suspended the inoculation drive this month due to shortage of vaccines. Last month, it had suspended the vaccination drive in the city at least thrice because of the same reason. According to the BMC, so far 73,36,171 citizens have been inoculated in the metropolis. Out of them, 18,09,075 beneficiaries have received both the doses. Currently, there are 428 active COVID-19 vaccination centres in Mumbai - 294 operated by the BMC, 20 government-run and 114 private centres. On Tuesday, Mumbai reported 288 new cases of COVID-19, taking the tally to 7,35,659, while three more patients succumbed to the infection, pushing the fatality count to 15,911, as per the civic body. There are two containment zones in the city, where 48 buildings are currently sealed as a preventive measure to curb the spread of coronavirus, it said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-357
04-08-2021||India||Prediction of light rain in Delhi||The capital is likely to witness partly cloudy sky and light rain on Wednesday, the India Meteorological Department said. The Safdarjung Observatory, considered the official marker for the city, recorded a minimum of 25.4 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal. The maximum temperature is predicted to settle around 34 degrees Celsius. Light to moderate rain is expected for the next three to four days, according to the IMD forecast. The weather department had earlier said that Delhi is likely to receive normal rainfall -- 95 to 106 percent of the long-period average -- in August. The capital had witnessed uncharacteristically heavy rainfall and an irregular weather pattern in July. After a delayed monsoon, which arrived over two weeks after the usual date of June 27, the capital gauged an unusual 507.1 mm rainfall this July, which was nearly 141 per cent above normal. It was also the maximum rainfall in the month since July 2003, and the second highest ever. Delhi gets maximum rainfall in July and August. Normally, the city receives 210.6 mm and 247.7 mm rainfall in July and August, respectively.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-357
04-08-2021||India||Covid: Central team to guide Kerala pandemic response||A central health team will arrive in Kerala on Friday to guide public health responses to Covid-19 in the state that is reporting a steady rise in daily new infections and accounts for a third of India’s current active cases. The Union health ministry said on Thursday that the six-member team led by Sujeet Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control, New Delhi, will recommend interventions to contain the large number of new infections in the state. Kerala on Thursday had over 154,000 Covid-19 patients, about 37 per cent of India’s 397,000 active cases. Its average daily new cases have increased to about 17,000 on July 28 from 11,000 four weeks ago. The health ministry has underlined that Kerala also has a high positivity rate — the fraction found positive among those tested — of about 12 per cent, more than double the ideal of less than 5 per cent. A high positivity rate is viewed as an indicator of widespread infections. Several districts in Kerala — Palakkad, Thrissur, Wayanad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kasargod, Kannur, Kollam, Ernakulam, and Kottayam — are among the 47 in 10 states across the country where test positivity rates are higher than 10 per cent. But sections of health experts have argued that Kerala’s high test positivity rate could also be an outcome of smart testing which is specifically directed at all close contacts and other individuals likely to test positive. Kerala’s relatively low Covid-19 seropositivity — the proportion of people with antibodies against Covid-19 — of 44 per cent, compared with over 70 per cent in states such as Bihar, Rajasthan or Uttar Pradesh, also implies a large proportion of susceptible people. Many public health experts believe the relatively low seropositivity and Kerala’s lower Covid-19 case fatality rate of 1.1 per cent, compared with the national average of 1.3 per cent, reflects an epidemic better managed than in other states. “However, the current exponential growth is a source of concern,” said a senior researcher. “Whenever and wherever the virus spreads and replicates, there is a chance of fresh mutations emerging.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-357
04-08-2021||India||Opposition leaders pledge to unite and fight Modi regime||Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday led a group of MPs in cycling to Parliament to draw the nation’s attention to the scourge of price rise after a meeting at which Opposition leaders pledged to unite and fight the Narendra Modi regime. While Rahul’s tractor ride to Parliament last week symbolised the farmers’ struggle against the government’s obduracy on the three controversial farm laws, the bicycle was used to amplify the agony of the common man burdened by abnormally high prices of essential commodities, including petroleum products. Placards asking if one LPG cylinder costing Rs 834 meant “achchhe din” were fixed to the bicycles. Rahul himself proposed at the breakfast meeting that members could cycle to Parliament to highlight the people’s sufferings. Around 40 bicycles were arranged by the Youth Congress and all of them were used as the younger MPs followed the Congress leader through the jam caused by jostling mediapersons, party workers and policemen. Parliament is less than a kilometre from the Constitution Club, where Rahul hosted the meeting of Opposition MPs. The meeting saw every leader stress the need for unity, with Rahul pointing out that the government was able to bulldoze the Opposition that represents 60 per cent of the population only because “we are not united”. Conceding there were differences among parties, he said there was complete agreement on three issues — farmers, Pegasus snooping and price rise — and this should be enough of a cementing factor to ensure a united approach. The parties present at the meeting represented the true federal spirit of India and smaller issues should not disturb the unity of purpose, which is to save the country, Rahul added. All other parties endorsed this view, committing themselves to fight the Modi regime together. The most emphatic message came from the Trinamul Congress whose absence from the last Opposition meeting had triggered speculation about disunity. Trinamul MP Kalyan Banerjee said Bengal had shown that Modi-Amit Shah could be fought and defeated despite the coercive pressure of the Enforcement Directorate, the CBI and other central agencies. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut also insisted there was no need to fear and that a unified fight would easily unsettle the Modi regime. A senior leader present at the meeting told The Telegraph: “For the first time after the devastating defeat in the 2019 parliamentary election, the determination to fight this regime was on display.” The senior leader said: “It was indeed a significant occasion marked by disappearance of pessimism. We cannot say at this stage that an alternative is ready to dislodge the government but we could feel the emergence of a new hope today. Some of us had reservations about Rahul Gandhi but he showed leadership mettle.” A Congress leader echoed this sentiment, saying: “There indeed were doubts about his capabilities, deepened by his decision to resign as party chief and leave the boat rudderless at this critical juncture. But he has now more than convinced everybody that he can do it. Nobody else can generate so much energy and hope within minutes. He barely spoke for four minutes but his humility, elegance and precision impressed everybody. I talked to several leaders of other parties and they were very impressed and hopeful.” Asked what the takeaway from the meeting was, a Rajya Sabha MP said: “What was unstated was of the greatest significance. There was no discussion on leadership, no resolutions passed but the implicit message was the complete absence of disagreement on Rahul’s leadership. If this has happened when he is not holding any post and there are murmurs of dissent within his party, one can imagine he won’t have any hurdles in his way once the Congress makes up its mind and he starts his national campaign. We assume the leadership issue is more or less settled.” Rahul himself showed maturity by stressing on collective effort and unity of purpose. He posted a photograph of the meeting with Opposition leaders with this crisp message: “One priority — our country, our people.” After the meeting, his tweet said: “Neither our faces are essential, nor our names. What is important is that we are representatives of people: in every face, there are faces of crores of Indians who are tormented by price rise. Is this achchhe din?” This narrative is antithetical to the politics of domination and supremacy. The subtext is clear: that issues are supreme and the country has to be saved. The contentious question — who will be the Prime Minister — will become relevant only after the mission of evicting the current government is accomplished. Till then, every leader will work with the larger cause in mind. This was the message of the meeting. The Bahujan Samaj Party, whose hidden axis with the BJP has been a subject of speculation over the past few years, was absent. So was the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Most leaders, however, said AAP was with the Opposition and their absence was more because of a communication gap. Those present included the Congress, Shiv Sena, Trinamul, NCP, DMK, RJD, Samajwadi Party, CPM, CPI, IUML, National Conference, JMM, RSP, KCM and the LJD.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-357
04-08-2021||India||Modi's pep talk to BJP contradicts his sermon as an Opposition||If forgetfulness was Rishi Durvasa’s curse for King Dushyant, it has turned out to be a blessing for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Little else explains a purported sermon by Modi on Tuesday in which he described the Opposition’s protests in Parliament as an “insult to the Constitution, democracy and the people”. The content of Modi’s pep talk to BJP parliamentarians stood in sharp contrast with what his own party had done when it was in Opposition. The BJP, as the principal Opposition party during the UPA’s 2004-2014 decade, had stymied Parliament like never before and justified the actions as a “form of democracy, like any other form”. If the Prime Minister needs the equivalent of a royal ring, which was retrieved from the belly of a fish so that Dushyant could remember Shakuntala, he needs to look up research by PRS Legislative Research.  The non-profit found that the productivity of the 15th Lok Sabha from 2009-14 was the worst in the past 50 years. Session after session had been completely or partially washed out as the BJP, especially during the UPA II innings, held uproarious protests over corruption allegations against the government. Appearing oblivious to or unmindful of such behaviour, Modi on Tuesday lashed out at the Opposition for protesting and trying to stall Parliament. The Opposition has been demanding discussions on the Pegasus snooping allegations, the farm protests and other pressing issues but the government has so far not displayed any appetite for such debates. “The conduct of the Opposition in both Houses is an insult to the Constitution, democracy and the people,” the Prime Minister was quoted as telling BJP parliamentarians at a closed-door meeting. Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said Modi expressed anger at the instances of snatching and tearing papers in Parliament. In 2012, the BJP had forced the washout of the monsoon session of Parliament over charges of corruption in allocation of coal blocks. Then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had termed BJP’s actions as a “negation of democracy”. Responding to this, the then leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, had justified the protests by saying: “Not allowing Parliament to function is also a form of democracy, like any other form.” The then leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley, had described the stalling of Parliament as a legitimate act to “hold the government accountable”. Many now feel the BJP is getting a taste of its own medicine. The BJP’s focus then had been demanding investigations into allegations of corruption and calling for the resignation of ministers, including the Prime Minister. In contrast, the present Opposition has been protesting only to demand a discussion in both Houses of Parliament on the Pegasus snooping, exposed by a global investigation, and the government has been firmly denying it. At a time several countries have ordered inquiries into the alleged surveillance using the Israeli spyware Pegasus, the Indian government has dismissed it as a “non-issue”. The Opposition has been demanding an immediate discussion since the spyware is sold only to governments. The Modi government so far has neither accepted nor denied having bought the spyware. On Tuesday, the Opposition protested for the 11th straight day in both Houses of Parliament, demanding an immediate discussion to seek answers from the government over the snooping charges. The Prime Minister has so far not spoken a word on Pegasus but has been repeatedly slamming the Opposition for obstructing Parliament.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-357
04-08-2021||India||Pegasus: Editors Guild of India moves SC against sypware scandal||The Editors Guild of India and a senior journalist on Tuesday jointly moved the Supreme Court seeking a directive to the Centre to disclose information on the electronic surveillance of Indian citizens using spyware. They have also demanded a court-monitored probe into allegations swirling around the Pegasus controversy, adding to the list of people approaching the Supreme Court on the issue. “The indiscriminate use of these capabilities against journalists and other democratic actors destroys freedom of speech and poisons the heart of democratic accountability,” the petition said. The Guild and veteran journalist Mrinal Pande have challenged the constitutional validity of Section 5 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, Rule 419A of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951, Section 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009. These provisions permit the government to intercept the electronic devices of citizens subject to various safeguards. The Narendra Modi government has so far resisted the Opposition’s demand to discuss the issue in Parliament and refused to acknowledge or deny whether it had bought the Pegasus software which can only be accessed by governments or government-run agencies. The petition, filed through advocate Lzafeer Ahmad, has asked if the Centre or any of its agencies had procured, licensed or obtained Pegasus from the Israeli NSO Group or its group companies or affiliates and used it to spy on Indian citizens, including journalists. The petitioners sought the following directives from the Supreme Court: ⚫ Direct the Centre to produce any contracts, agreements or memoranda of understanding with foreign companies for supplying spyware, hacking or electronic surveillance tools for use on Indian citizens. ⚫ Order the government to disclose the details of how such spyware, hacking or electronic surveillance tools were paid for. ⚫ Direct the Union of India to disclose the details of the list of people who have been under electronic surveillance or have been subjected to hacking or spying. The government should also be asked to furnish the details of who prepared the list. ⚫ Direct the Centre to reveal how many of the Indian citizens who have been under electronic surveillance or have been subjected to hacking have been charged with involvement in serious crimes. ⚫ An independent special investigation team (SIT) should be set up to probe the alleged procurement and use of Pegasus. The petitioners argued that the alleged snooping was a serious assault on the freedom of the media, free speech and citizens’ right to life and liberty, besides being a criminal offence. Earlier, advocate M.L. Sharma, CPM Rajya Sabha MP John Brittas and journalists N. Ram, Sashi Kumar, Paranjoy Guha Thakurta and Rupesh Kumar Singh had moved the top court. The petitions are expected to come up for hearing on Thursday before a bench of Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana and Justice Surya Kant. “Pegasus is capable of astronomical surveillance which includes accessing every bit of stored data on one’s phone; real time access to emails, texts, phone calls; controlling all cameras on the device; activating the sound recording function; transmitting all sounds in the vicinity of the device; detecting whether two phones have come in physical proximity; activating features even when the phone is switched off, and more,” the Guild’s petition said. “In the face of the NSO Group’s stated position that it only sells to ‘vetted governments’, these allegations of spying raise grave concerns of abuse of office; dismantling of separation of power; infringement of fundamental rights to privacy, freedom of speech and expression, and freedom of the press; subversion of the democratic process; and commission of serious criminal offences,” the petition added. “The Pegasus cyber attacks, prima facie, disclose the commission of several serious offences under the Information Technology Act, 2000; the Indian Penal Code, 1860; the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885; and the Official Secrets Act, 1923. Journalists are tasked with enforcing the public’s right to be informed, to accountability, and to open and transparent government. “The petitioner’s members and all journalists have the duty in our democracy of holding all branches of government accountable by seeking information, explanations and constitutionally valid justifications for state action and inaction,” the petition said. According to the petitioners, freedom of the press relies on non-interference by the government and its agencies in reporting by journalists, including their ability to securely and confidentially speak with sources, investigate abuse of power and corruption, expose government incompetence, and communicate with those opposed to the dispensation. “The citizens of India have a right to know if the executive government is infringing the limits of their authority under the Constitution and what steps have been taken to safeguard their fundamental rights,” the petition said. “The petitioners are before this Hon’ble Court to seek the enforcement of this right, in performance of their obligations as trustees of the public, and on behalf of all citizens of India. “It is regretfully submitted that all attempts to seek accountability and enforce constitutional limits through parliamentary processes have been stonewalled. Through their intransigence, the respondents (the Union government and its instrumentalities) have deliberately avoided public debate on this issue and have provided obfuscated answers, forcing the petitioner to approach this Hon’ble Court,” it added. The petition continued: “The petitioners also seek a court-appointed special investigation team monitored by this Hon’ble Court to investigate every aspect of the use of Pegasus by the Government of India and against Indian citizens, especially journalists. Finally, the petitioners have challenged the constitutional vires of electronic surveillance, hacking and use of spyware, and the existing legal architecture for surveillance, in light of the gigantic leaps in technology and surveillance capabilities.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-358

04-08-2021||India||SC to examine urgent plea  seeking contempt proceedings against Modi||The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to examine a plea for early listing of a PIL seeking contempt proceedings against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and the Union home ministry over the appointment of IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as the police commissioner of Delhi. The petition, filed by advocate Manohar Lal Sharma, has contended that the appointment of Asthana four days before his retirement was in gross violation of Supreme Court directives. A bench of Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana and Justice V. Surya Kant asked Sharma to furnish the number of the petition so that it can be considered for “urgent listing”. “We will see… let it be numbered first,” CJI Ramana said. The petition, besides seeking contempt action against the Prime Minister and the home minister, has claimed that they had lost the moral and constitutional right to continue in office, having violated the Supreme Court’s directions. Sharma pleaded that the appointment should be examined by a constitution bench of the Supreme Court having a minimum of five judges to settle the law on the matter, arguing that otherwise there would be a constitutional breakdown and people would lose faith in the country. Sharma, who had earlier filed a plea seeking a probe by a special investigation team into the Pegasus snooping controversy, alleged that Asthana’s appointment had been a breach of Supreme Court rulings that all vacancies must first be notified to the Union Public Service Commission six months in advance and that no officer who has less than six months’ service left will be appointed as a director-general of police (DGP). Asthana was appointed as the commissioner of Delhi police, which reports to the Union home ministry, four days before his scheduled retirement on July 31, and was granted a year’s extension of service. The Delhi police commissioner’s rank is equivalent to that of a DGP. Sharma has named the Prime Minister as respondent No. 1, the home minister as respondent No. 2, and the Union home ministry as respondent No. 3 for what he called “wilful denial” to comply with the Supreme Court’s rulings. “Respondent No. 1, the head of the ACC (appointments committee of the cabinet), and respondent No. 2… jointly decided and did the impugned appointment against the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Hence they are party to this for contempt of court,” the petition stated. The PIL recalled that on July 3, 2018, the Supreme Court had in the Prakash Singh vs Union of India case prohibited the appointment of an officer with less than six months of service left as DGP. Sharma said that on July 27 this year, the appointments committee of the cabinet headed by the Prime Minister appointed Asthana as the Delhi police commissioner for one year. The petitioner contended that the action of the Union government amounted to contempt of court and cited the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, and a number of earlier Supreme Court judgments wherein it had been stated that “civil contempt refers to wilful disobedience to any judgment of the court, while criminal contempt can be invoked if an act tends to scandalise or lower the authority of the court or tends to interfere with or obstruct the administration of justice”. Sharma claimed that the appointment was a case of both civil and criminal contempt.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-358
04-08-2021||India||Covid: Epidemic shows exponential growth in eight states across India||The Covid-19 epidemic is showing exponential growth rates in eight states across India, health officials said on Tuesday, flagging worrisome signals amid a nationwide decline in daily new cases and high uncertainty over the pandemic’s future course. The eight states — Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Lakshadweep, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Karnataka, Kerala and Puducherry — currently have high and increasing R values, or reproduction numbers, ranging from 1.1 to 1.4, reflecting sharply growing epidemics. The R value, a measure of how fast an infection spreads, represents new infections generated by one infected person. An R value of 1.4 implies 10 cases will generate 14 new infections. Any R value greater than 1 implies exponential growth and it needs to be below 1 for an epidemic to shrink. Nine states — Andhra Pradesh, Bengal, Delhi, Goa, Haryana, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, and Nagaland — have R values of 1 with either stable or declining epidemics, the health officials said. “Some states have R (value) going in the wrong direction — above one and rising. The virus wishes to expand. We must curb it,” said Vinod Paul, a senior paediatrician and member of Niti Aayog, the Centre’s top think tank, who is among experts guiding the government on its Covid-19 responses. India’s daily new infections declined from a peak of over 400,000 in early May to around 46,000 cases in early July but have remained near-stable at around 40,000 since then. The counts of active patients have declined from over 3.7 million in mid-May to around 400,000. Kerala and Maharashtra account for over 60 per cent of the country’s active cases. Kerala on Tuesday had over 165,000 patients, followed by Maharashtra with 78,700 and Karnataka with 24,000. Ten districts in Kerala, nine in Manipur, six in Mizoram, four each in Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Nagaland, two in Sikkim, and one each in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry and Rajasthan show large epidemics. The health officials underlined the need for highly affected districts and all states with exponential growth rates to intensify public health measures such as containment, contact tracing and house-to-house surveillance within perimeter-controlled zones to prevent the infection’s spread. A central public health team that visited Kerala has identified the need for enhanced containment measures. In Kerala’s Mallapuram district, the team observed a contact tracing ratio of about 1:1.5, meaning for every two positive cases, health authorities were testing three contacts. “Our guidelines recommend a contact tracing ratio of about 1:20,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the Union health ministry. With over 90 per cent of positive cases in Kerala under home isolation, Agarwal said it is critical to test all close contacts and not just those with symptoms. Public health experts have predicted that India is unlikely to experience a fresh nationwide Covid-19 surge as high as the second wave because over 67 per cent of the country’s population show protective antibodies but have cautioned that localised surges will occur. The other 33 per cent, or 400 million people, remain susceptible to the infection and will provide opportunities for the virus to infect and spread, experts have said. “Cases are likely to rise wherever there is laxity on personal precautions or public health measures,” a health official said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-358
04-08-2021||India|| Record 99.04% students pass CBSE Class X exams||A record 99.04 per cent students have passed the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class X exams, whose results were announced on Tuesday, and over 2.58 lakh pupils have scored over 90 per cent marks. The pass rates in 2020 and 2019 had been 91.46 per cent and 91.1 per cent, respectively. Last year, 1.84 lakh students had secured over 90 per cent marks, while in 2019 around 2.25 lakh had done so. Nearly 21.13 lakh candidates had registered for the Class X exams this time, of whom the results of 20.97 lakh students have been declared. The results of the remaining students are under process. Around 2.01 lakh students have scored between 90 and 95 per cent, while 57,824 students have got over 95 per cent marks. Among the 16 regions, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala recorded the highest pass rate, at 99.99 per cent, while Guwahati in Assam clocked the lowest, at 90.54 per cent. The Class X board exams, like the Class XII tests whose results were announced last month, had not been held owing to the pandemic. The CBSE marked the Class X students on the basis of performance in school-based exams (80 per cent weightage) and internal assessment (20 per cent). Internal assessment included performance in projects, notebook writing, homework and classroom (mostly online) activities. Each school formed a panel of teachers to award the remaining 80 marks in each subject based on the following break-up — 40 marks for the pre-board exam, 30 marks for the half-yearly exam and 10 marks for periodic tests. Several academics were of the opinion that learning levels had declined this time. Ameeta Mulla Wattal, the chairperson of the DLF Schools, said: “The major concern is that learning has taken a big hit. Online learning is not effective. There is boredom and exertion. Now we need to reopen schools. Schools have reopened the world over except in India.” Sangeeta Bhatia, the principal of KIIT World School in New Delhi, said this year’s results were aimed more at ensuring that students did not come under more stress during all-encompassing adversities due to the pandemic. “I see certain provisions have been made for de-stressing the students in this difficult period when schools have remained closed for almost the entire academic session. But the results do not matter much. What matters are the skills acquired and the depth of learning that will help them move forward in life,” she said. Students usually continue in the same school where they have studied till Class X, so there won’t be too many problems over admission to Class XI, Bhatia said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-358
04-08-2021||India||Meenakshi Lekhi's Kashmiri pandit comment stirs up a storm||Union minister Meenakshi Lekhi has kicked up a storm by suggesting that Kashmiri Pandits were to blame for their failure to return to the Valley, comparing their situation to migrant labourers who have returned to their places of work after having gone home during the first wave of pandemic. The return and rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits has always been high on the ruling BJP’s agenda and the party has often forcefully censured its rival Congress for failing to ensure their return. Most Kashmiri Pandits are said to be supporters of the BJP. Lekhi, who recently took charge as minister of state for external affairs and culture, however, has ruffled feathers by comparing the issue of Pandits to that of migrant labourers and saying the community has to share the blame for their failure to return. The minister, during an online interaction with Kashmiri Pandits, was asked by a speaker when they would be rehabilitated in Kashmir to “save their culture”. “I am really surprised at the question because as a person who is part of this country, you are free to move wherever you want to move. Nobody is stopping people from going back to their homes, and whatever else is needed will be provided,” the minister replied. Lekhi then compared their plight with migrant labourers who had to return to their home states after the coronavirus pandemic broke out in 2020 but were back at their workplaces when the situation improved. “When corona happened in Delhi, a lot of migrant workers had come from Bihar, Jharkhand and wherever. They were here and whatever was the treatment meted out to them by Delhi government, they all went back and they have all come back. Where is the problem? I think people also take a call where they wish to be,” she said, suggesting Pandits were not taking the initiative. Interrupting her, a Pandit participant asked whether it was possible for them to return to the Valley. “That is why I am surprised at the question because so far as the government is concerned, it continues to be with the people of India whether in Kashmir, Bihar or Delhi or wherever. Some initiative needs to come from people themselves also,” the minister said. Lekhi then said many Pandits were not interested at all in returning to the Valley. “I know there are lots of people who are settled across (the country) and they are settled well. So on one side, their heart may be pining for their original place of habitation but they are very happy with wherever they are living also. They do not want to be disturbed… People need to take some private initiative as well,” she said. The remarks left the Pandit participants fuming, with one asking her to clarify whether the migrant labourers’ issue was comparable to their migration. “Sorry Madam, you have no concept what Kashmiri Pandits have suffered. It is a (forced) migration. People have been kicked out of Kashmir. You have no concept and are comparing Covid (migration) with Pandit migration,” he said. BJP sources said Lekhi’s remarks betrays frustration within a section of its leadership that Pandits were not showing a “spine” to return while the situation was “conducive” for their return. It would appear as a blow to the BJP if it fails to facilitate the return of Pandits after two consecutive terms in power. The remarks triggered outrage among a section of Pandits. “This is a tight slap from the core member of @BJP4India @M_Lekhi on the face of Modi Bhakts from Kashmiri Pandit community. Hope now the KP’s who called this politician their God hang their heads in shame & apologise to everyone. Thanks a lot for being blunt about your policy,” tweeted Mohit Bhan, a Kashmiri Pandit and a spokesman of the People’s Democratic Party. Senior BJP leader Ashwani Chrungoo, also a Pandit, hit out at Lekhi’s remarks and said he would call her and ask her to withdraw the comments. “It is an unbecoming statement in the sense that Government of India is already conscious of its responsibilities and a lot of things are being done and are under process,” Chrungoo told The Telegraph. “It is a statement that cannot be taken so seriously. It has come from a person of a junior rank. It cannot be called a statement from the government.” The BJP leader said the situation in the Valley is not conducive for the return of Pandits as “there is neither peace nor normalcy in Kashmir”. The BJP central leadership had claimed that Article 370 was a hurdle in restoring peace.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-358
04-08-2021||India||Five Africans arrested after custody death protest||Police have arrested five African nationals and slapped them with charges ranging from rioting to outraging the modesty of a woman officer a day after a protest over the alleged custodial death of a Congolese national in the city. While the police said Joel Malu, 27, died after a cardiac arrest at a private hospital early on Monday, hours after he was taken into custody for possessing drugs, the African community was outraged. Bangalore North deputy commission of police Dharmender Kumar Meena told The Telegraph on Tuesday that the five men were booked several sections including IPC Sections 146 (rioting), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duty), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant) and 354 (outraging the modesty of a woman). The arrested men were among the 20-odd African nationals who protested against the alleged custodial death of Malu outside JC Nagar police station where he was taken. The Bangalore unit of the Pan-African Federation and Students’ Union India, a body of African nationals, on Tuesday decided to extend all cooperation to the police in the investigation but resolved to fight for their rights to live peacefully in the city. On the allegation of custodial death, Kumar said: “The inquest conducted by a judicial magistrate  has established there was not a single mark on his body.” A resident of east Bangalore, Malu was taken to the police station around 2.15am on Monday. He was shifted to a hospital around 5.30am. “We found 5 grams of MDMA (popularly called ecstasy) on him and that was why he was arrested,” said Kumar.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-358

The farmers said the chariot is a symbol of their commitment to continue the agitation till they “dislodge the BJP from power”. “The Narendra Modi government believes that one day we would become tired and return home without winning. This rath tells the Prime Minister that we are not returning before our victory or before throwing him out of power,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Guddu Pradhan, who led the procession that reached the Ghazipur border after a journey of six hours. “About 50 farmers can take rest in this air-conditioned rath. It was originally a bus which was redesigned and turned into a rath — which is itself a symbol of victory. The farmers contributed for the rath,” he said. Pradhan claimed that 30,000 farmers followed in cars and motorcycles behind the chariot. “From today, at least 2,000 more farmers from western Uttar Pradesh will come to the Ghazipur border every day. We will encourage those who have been at the border for a long time to return home for a few days and then rejoin the dharna. The world is watching everything and wants to know from India’s Prime Minister why he is so insensitive towards the demand of the farmers,” he said. Om Pal Malik, divisional in-charge of the BKU, told reporters in Meerut that the mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar on August 5 would be attended by farmers from across the country. “We are going to launch a campaign against the BJP government to defeat it in the 2022 UP Assembly elections,” said Malik.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-358

The incident occurred at Mahchhi village under Gopalpur police station in the district on Monday night after the victim identified as one Chanchal Mahto, 62, died. Five persons had allegedly assaulted Mahto on July 19 while working in his agriculture farm on a disputed land. He was admitted to government medical college and hospital in Bettiah for treatment, where he succumbed to his injuries on August 2. The police got a post-mortem conducted and handed over the body to his family members on the same evening. However, the enraged family members of Mahto carried his body to the place where the accused lived. They built a funeral pyre and cremated him on it, while demanding the arrest of the people involved in killing him. The police were present on the occasion. They tried to stop Mahto’s family members and acquaintances from cremating his body there, but their entreaties fell on deaf ears. Meanwhile, Gopalpur station house officer Rajrup Rai said that prima facie it seemed that Mahto had died of heart attack while undergoing treatment at the government medical college and hospital. “We are yet to receive the post-mortem report of Mahto. Only then will we be able to say anything with certainty,” Rai said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-358
04-08-2021||India||Flood threat looms large over Patna  ||Flood situation worsened in southern parts of Bihar with the Ganga and Punpun rivers crossing the danger level and threatening the state capital with a deluge on Tuesday. It is expected to cross the red mark at other places too. The Ganga was flowing 23cm above the danger level of 48.60 metres, and was showing a rising trend. It was slightly below the danger level at places outside Patna, but was expected to cross it due to the increasing flow in the river. On the other hand, Punpun river was flowing 1.75m above the danger level of 50.60 metres, with water spilling over embankments and spreading in the vast agricultural fields lying to the south and east of Patna. Other smaller rivers were also in spate. Floodwaters from smaller rivers swirled around Patna, inundating villages and forcing thousands of people to leave their homes in search of dry and safer places. Road communication was disrupted in the affected areas. The current situation is a result of heavy rains in Jharkhand leading to a sharp increase in the volume of water in the rivers flowing towards the Ganga and its tributaries coming from the southern parts of the state and neighbouring Jharkhand. The deluge has affected parts of Patna, Nalanda, Gaya, Jehanabad, Aurangabad, Rohtas and Kaimur districts. Floodwater was flowing over the National Highway 30A between Daniyawan and Biharsharif in Nalanda, the home district of chief minister Nitish Kumar. Bihar water resources department chief engineer (flood control and drainage) for Patna region, Shailendra said that embankments have either been breached at several places or water was flowing above them into the countryside flooding vast stretches of land. “The floodwaters are flowing above the embankments in such a big area that it is very difficult for us to control the situation. Our teams are working round-the-clock for the purpose,” Shailendra told The Telegraph. Chief minister Nitish Kumar reviewed the flood situation and directed senior officials to keep taking updates about the water level in rivers, continue the vigil at the embankments and complete the repair works at the places they are being eroded by the rivers. “Immediate steps should be taken for rescue and relief at wherever floods have caused destruction. The engineers should understand why erosion occurred at the embankments and work to ensure that it does not happen in future,” Nitish told the senior officials. Water resources department officials said that the situation would improve slowly because the Ganga was also flooded and was not accepting water from its tributaries.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-359
