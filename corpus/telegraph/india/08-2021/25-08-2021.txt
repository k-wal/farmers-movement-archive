25-08-2021||India||411,810 tonnes of grains lost in transit in four years: Report||Around 411,810 tonnes of wheat and rice were wasted as transit and pilferage losses in the past four years, a Standing Committee report on food, consumer affairs and public distribution, tabled in Parliament earlier this month, revealed. The report also highlighted that the loss of foodgrains led to an estimated Rs1,109.82 crore in the past four years, till October 2020, and subsidised commodities were enough to feed 82.3 million people if distributed properly. The Centre provides around 5kg of wheat of rice at subsidised rates under its Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana. “The government should take significant steps to mitigate transit and storage losses and save taxpayers’ money,” the committee stated in its report. The report also showcased the condition of the country’s food storage and transit infrastructure, as well as the decentralised procurement scheme (DCP). Under the DCP, the states procure, store and distribute foodgrains themselves under the Centre’s targeted public distribution system (TPDS) and other welfare schemes. The decentralised system of procurement has the objectives to ensure that Minimum Support Price (MSP) is passed on to the farmers, to enhance the efficiency of procurement and to encourage procurement in non-traditional states, thereby extending the benefits of MSP to local farmers as well as to save on transit losses and costs. The Standing Committee report shows that so far only 23 states have implemented it – 15 to procure rice and eight to procure wheat – despite the scheme being in place for the past 23 years. The Parliament panel raised questions on the actions taken against the officials responsible for the transit losses. It found out that around 153 cases were filed in 2018-19 while 144 were lodged in 2019-20 and 44 in 2020-21 (till September 2020). Of these, 18 cases of unjustifiable losses are still pending while a total of 89 cases of storage losses registered till September 2020 are pending. Reacting to the findings, the Standing Committee suggested the Food Security of India (FSI) come up with new standards, guidelines and checklists to mitigate the transit and pilferage losses of foodgrains and make officials and workers more aware. Moreover, it asked for a framework to deal with pending cases of corruption, excise duty and related matters against the officials. Meanwhile, the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution responded to the report in Parliament to say that it has taken several steps to check corruption in FCI godowns. “Farmers are now provided with the MSP online while the agencies are paid through an online system. The quality-related parameters of cereals are put up on public domain,” Union minister Piyush Goyal said, adding, “Procurement process is being inspected regularly and action taken against those who are found guilty of adulteration. The produce is tagged at every step of the process – from the mills to depot.” Several steps have also been taken to monitor the distribution including regulating selling in the open market by limiting it through a modulated e-auction, Down To Earth reported quoting the ministry. “CCTV cameras are also installed in all the godowns. In addition, committees have been formed to redress the grievances of the contractors.” However, despite measures taken by the Centre, losses to the tune of Rs 280.94 crore was incurred due to transit wastage in 2020-21 (till October 2020), the committee said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-276
25-08-2021||India||US INDOPACOM commander holds talks with India's top military brass||China's military build-up has been the largest since World War II and the real question is the intent behind the expansion as words of the Chinese PLA do not always match its deeds, Commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command Admiral John Aquilino said on Wednesday. Admiral Aquilino, on a visit to India, held extensive talks with Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, Chief of Army Staff Gen MM Naravane, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria, Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh, and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar with a focus on further strengthening the bilateral defence partnership. The Commander said the US's relationship with India is based on "aligned values" and presents an important model for building enduring partnerships. "As we increase interoperability, information-sharing, and access with allies and partners across the globe, this partnership enhances our capabilities, improves our coordination, and shows that we are stronger when we stand together," he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM). In an interactive session at the Observer Research Foundation (ORF), Admiral Aquilino spoke about key challenges facing the Indo-Pacific and delved into China's rapid military build-up including in the maritime domain. He also hinted at the possibility of increasing the number of participants at the Malabar naval exercise if leaders of the four countries that are part of it at present concur with it. "I do not really look specifically at the nuclear threat. What I would look at is the entire Chinese way forward with regard to military expansion, the largest military build-up in the history since World War II (in) both conventional and nuclear, in all domains," he said in presence of Gen Rawat. "I do not think I will try to explain what their intent is but trying to understand their intent is a little concerning. The articulation of defensive capabilities is what we continue to hear," he said. Admiral Aquilino was asked about reports of China's rapid expansion of its nuclear stockpile. "We also continue to see that the words from the PLA (People's Liberation Army) do not always match the deeds. So it is one of the reasons that we are concerned. That expansion, the real question is not why but what they intend to do with it and that remains to be seen," the Commander added. He described the "attack" on the rules-based international order in the maritime domain as one of the "most critical challenges", in a clear reference to China's military aggressiveness in the Indo-Pacific. To a question, he said coordination among Quad countries from a military perspective happens every day.  Admiral Aquilino's visit to India came nearly four months after he took charge of the oldest and largest combatant command of the US that is responsible for American military activities in the Indo-Pacific. Without naming China, the Commander also talked about "economic coercion", corruption, actions against Taiwan, new rules that were foisted upon people of Hong Kong and the challenges that the Indians saw with regard to "sovereignty on the Line of Actual Control". "The attack on the rules-based international order that allows freedom of navigation for all is certainly one of the most critical challenges. That freedom of navigation allows two-thirds of the world's economy to flow through the South China Sea," he said. "One-quarter of the world's liquid natural gas flows through the area. It is critical for the prosperity of all the nations and when it is challenged and potentially confronted, that will negatively impact all the nations in the region. Those are the foundational security concerns that I see. There are many more," he added. Describing the Indo-Pacific as the most consequential region for the future, Admiral Aquilino said there was a need for like-minded countries to work together to confront various challenges facing the region. Asked about China's increasing its nuclear arsenal, Gen Rawat said these strategic weapons are weapons of deterrence, "We are concerned about whatever is happening anywhere in the region because it is not only our northern neighbour, but our western neighbour too has these nuclear systems," he said in a reference to Pakistan. "We are evolving our strategies accordingly. We are studying these carefully and we are quite capable of dealing with both adversaries with conventional forces," he said. On Chinese Navy, Gen Rawat said China is expanding its naval forces "exponentially" "Today, possibly it is the largest expanding Navy in the world. We see the threat emerging in the Indian Ocean Region," he said adding India has to counter the threat by developing our naval prowess accordingly. Gen Rawat also talked about the need for having some commonality of communication equipment among the navies of the Quad countries for greater interoperability.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-276
25-08-2021||India||Government panel to meet soon on roadmap for Zydus jab introduction in vaccine drive||The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) will soon hold a meeting to devise a roadmap for introducing Zydus Cadila's Covid vaccine in the inoculation drive and prioritising beneficiaries focusing on those aged 12-18 years with comorbidities. The indigenously developed world's first DNA-based needle-free COVID-19 vaccine ZyCoV-D received emergency use authorisation from the drug regulator on August 20 making it the first vaccine to be administered in the age group of 12-18 years in the country. NTAGI Chairman Dr N K Arora said it is estimated that there are around 12 crore adolescents in the age group of 12-18 years in India and less than 1 per cent of them may have comorbidities. The three-dose vaccine available for those in the age group of 12-18 years besides adults, will be rolled out in October. "The NTAGI's meeting will be held soon to chalk out a roadmap for introducing the three-dose ZyCoV-D vaccine in the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination drive. The meeting will also focus on prioritisation of beneficiaries as this vaccine is approved for both adolescents and adults," he said. "The aim is to develop a priority list with the focus being on adolescents aged 12-18 years with comorbidities," Dr Arora said. The NTAGI will provide the protocol and framework for the introduction of this vaccine in the COVID-19 immunisation drive. On the issue of reopening of schools, Dr Arora said it should be done in a phased manner. "Besides parents and other members of the family, it has to be ensured that all the support staff whether it be school bus drivers, teachers or other staff in the schools are vaccinated against coronavirus to create a protective ring around children," he said, adding children mostly contract mild infections. Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V vaccines are being given to only those above 18 years and unlike ZyCoV-D, which is three-dose, these are administered in two doses. The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) has said that ZyCoV-D is the world's first DNA-based vaccine against coronavirus and when injected produces the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and elicits an immune response, which plays a vital role in protection from the disease as well as viral clearance. It said interim results from phase 3 clinical trials in over 28,000 volunteers showed primary efficacy of 66.6 per cent for symptomatic RT-PCR positive cases. This has been the largest vaccine trial so far in India for COVID-19, the DBT said. The vaccine had already exhibited robust immunogenicity and tolerability and safety profile in the adaptive phase one and two clinical trials. Both phase one/two and phase three clinical trials have been monitored by an independent data safety monitoring board, it added. (PTI)||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-276
25-08-2021||India||Kerala logs over 30,000 Covid cases,  positivity rate 19 per cent||Kerala on Wednesday reported over 30,000 daily virus cases, after a gap of three months, while its Test Positivity Rate (TRP) rose to 19 per cent. The southern state on Wednesday logged 31,445 fresh coronavirus infections and the toll mounted to 19,972 with 215 new deaths. The last time Kerala crossed the 30,000 mark was on May 20 when it reported 30,491 cases. The TPR on Wednesday crossed the 19 per cent mark, according to a state government release. While the latest surge pushed the the total infection count to 38,83,429, the government announced an intensive screening programme to reduce further spread of the contagion. After the Onam festivities, medical experts had predicted that the TPR would go beyond 20 per cent and the number of infections would rise further. Since July 27, after the Bakrid celebrations when restrictions were relaxed for a few days, Kerala has been logging more than or close to 20,000 cases almost every day. The release further said that as many as 20,271 people have been cured of the infection since Tuesday, taking the total recoveries to 36,92,628 and the number of active cases to 1,70,292. In the last 24 hours, 1,65,273 samples were tested and the TPR was found to be 19.03 per cent. So far, 3,06,19,046 samples have been tested, it said. Among districts, Ernakulam recorded the highest number with 4,048 cases, followed by Thrissur (3,865), Kozhikode (3,680), Malappuram (3,502), Palakkad (2,562), Kollam (2,479), Kottayam (2,050), Kannur (1,930) Alappuzha (1,874), Thiruvananthapuram (1,700), Idukki (1,166) Pathanamthitta (1,008) and Wayanad (962). Of the new cases, 123 were health workers, 138 from outside the state and 29,608 infected through contact, with the source of the contact not being clear in 1,576 cases, the release said. There are currently 4,70,860 people under surveillance in various districts. Of these, 4,44,278 are in home or institutional quarantine and 26,582 in hospitals. With the rise in Covid-19 cases in the state, state Health Minister Veena George said an intensive screening/testing program has been launched to detect as soon as possible who all are infected with coronavirus and to reduce further spread of the pandemic. In a Facebook post, she said testing will be maximised in low vaccination districts and people should voluntarily get tested. She said that sample collection will be done directly in the cluster areas and through camps and steps have also been taken to provide the test results without delay. Kerala has adopted the scientific method of test per million by case per million and therefore, as the number of cases increased, so did the number of inspections, she said. All those who are suffering from fever, cold, and sore throat or are susceptible to these diseases and those who have been in contact with Covid positive persons should be screened for the virus, the minister said. She further said that people with respiratory problems and serious illnesses should be examined to make sure they are not infected by Covid-19, even if they have only minor symptoms, as such people can be severely affected if they are infected with coronavirus. If anyone who has attended a public ceremony or event, like a wedding or funeral, tests Covid positive, everyone who was there at such events should get tested, she said. Meanwhile, the Opposition Congress picked holes in the virus management system in the state and urged the LDF government to immediately release the health data in this regard. Leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly, V D Satheesan alleged that the Covid control system in the state has failed and wanted the government to revive its existing strategies and methodology for the disease management. "Though the total number of Covid patients had crossed 38 lakh mark in the state, the government is still hiding the health data related to it. This will prevent evolving strategies to fight the third wave of the disease," he told a press meet here. The lack of data analysis has seriously affected even the research activities in the southern state, the leader added. Alleging that the contact tracing system in the state is a failure in finding out the infected, he said its ratio in Kerala is just 1:1.5, though at least 20 people have to be tested if a person is found to have been affected with the disease.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-276

Taslim Ali was thrashed in Govind Nagar here on Sunday for using a `fake' name while selling bangles to women in the locality. Four persons were arrested in connection with the assault. Ali, a native of Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh, himself has now been arrested under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act for allegedly touching a 13-year-old girl inappropriately, Indore Superintendent of police Ashutosh Bagri said. A police team has been sent to Hardoi to verify the two Aadhaar cards with different names recovered from Ali's bag, he said, adding that a burnt voter's identity card was also found in which the name of his father was mentioned as "Mohan Singh". Ali was produced through video link before special judge for POCSO cases Suman Shrivastav who remanded him in judicial custody till September 3, sources in the public prosecution department said. According to the police, a Class 6 student had lodged a complaint at Banganga police station here alleging that Ali had introduced himself as Golu, son of Mohan Singh when he arrived at her house to sell bangles on Sunday, and after describing her as very beautiful, he tried to touch her inappropriately.

It is the fourth MiG-21 crash this year. The plane crashed in a largely uninhabited area in village Matsar at about 5.30 PM, they said, adding the IAF has ordered a Court of Inquiry. Defence spokesperson Lt. Colonel Amitabh Sharma said that the plane was on a routine training sortie. The pilot sustained minor injuries and was assisted by the local villagers. He was later taken to a hospital. "No loss of life has been reported. The debris of the plane, some of it on fire, was scattered in a large area," said a district official. The IAF tweeted, "At around 1730 hrs today, an IAF MiG-21 Bison aircraft airborne for a training sortie in the western sector, experienced a technical malfunction after take off. The pilot ejected safely." "A Court of Inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the cause," it said. Sub-inspector Narpat Dan, who reached the spot, said that a thatched house in Dhani caught fire in the incident. Senior officials of the district administration and police also rushed to the crash site. Two pilots were killed in separate MiG-21 crashes in March and May in Gwalior (MP) and Moga (Punjab), respectively. Another MiG-21 Bison fighter plane had crashed at Suratgarh airbase of Sri Ganganagar district in Rajasthan in January, but the pilot survived. The Soviet-origin Mi-21 Bison is an upgraded version of the MiG-21 aircraft that the IAF began inducting in the 1960s. The IAF has lost many MiG-21s and other aircraft in accidents in the last few years. In June 2019, the Ministry of Defence informed Parliament that 27 IAF aircraft have crashed since 2016. At present, the IAF has around six squadrons of Mig-21 Bisons. A squadron comprises around 18 aircraft.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-277

Speaking to reporters after securing bail from a Mahad court on Tuesday and further relief from the Bombay High Court on Wednesday, Rane also asserted that he is not afraid of the ruling Shiv Sena in the state. "I am not afraid of anyone and I am not backing out. My words were an expression of anger against the chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray) who forgot the year of India's Independence. I only told reporters what he had already said, so how can it be a crime," Rane said. Rane made the controversial remarks on Monday after which Shiv Sena workers lodged police complaints against him in several districts. Acting on these complaints, police arrested Rane and produced him before the Mahad court where he was granted bail late Tuesday night. Asked how he will criticise Maharashtra's Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance government, he said, "I will criticise using good words." Rane said Thackeray had ordered his party workers to break the jaws of people attacking the Sena Bhavan (party headquarters in Mumbai). "Thackeray had also said that Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath should be beaten up with sandals," Rane claimed. "Uddhav Thackeray also called Union Home Minister Amit Shah shameless. He even said he was using unparliamentary words deliberately to describe Shah. What a civilised language," Rane said. Referring to Shiv Sena leaders referring to his alleged crimes, Rane said, "If I was a gangster according to the Sena, that party made me the chief minister. Was it ok with the party? I will not sit quietly. We will use all parliamentary tools and legal powers and corner the MVA government in coming days." Asked about some Shiv Sena MLAs issuing verbal threats, Rane said, "I wonder whether they had ever killed a mouse."||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-277

Sisodia said he had written to the Union Health Minister regarding the formation of the panel. Delhi LG Anil Baijal has twice rejected the city government's demand to form the panel, he said. "The Health Minister has written to us saying that there is a Supreme Court-appointed task force to probe the matter and has said there is no need for a probe panel. But the task force has the mandate to probe the demand and supply issues for the pandemic," he said in an online briefing. Mandaviya has said that out of the 12 points for reference for the SC panel, five are related to oxygen, the deputy chief minister noted and pointed out that none of these five points pertain to oxygen shortage-related deaths. "Such a big fraud has never happened in the country. If the SC-appointed panel is probing the deaths, why did the Centre ask states to give data on oxygen-related fatalities," Sisodia said. Centre does not want a probe into the deaths due to oxygen shortage because truth of their negligence will come out, he alleged.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-277
25-08-2021||India||Centre asks states to vaccinate school teachers ahead of Teachers' Day||Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Wednesday said more than two crore additional Covid-19 vaccine doses are being made available to states this month and they have been asked to vaccinate all school teachers on priority before Teachers' Day on September 5. Schools across the country were closed in March last year ahead of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of novel coronavirus infection. The Centre had allowed the reopening of schools as per the Covid-19 situation in October last year. While several states began partial reopening of schools, there was a complete closure again in April when an aggressive second wave of Covid-19 hit the country. With an improvement in the Covid-19 situation again, several states have begun reopening schools now even as concerns have been expressed over the staff and teachers not being completely vaccinated. “In addition to the plan to provide vaccines to every state this month, more than 2 crore vaccine doses are being made available. We have requested all states to try to vaccinate all school teachers on priority before Teachers' Day, which is celebrated on September 5,” Mandaviya said in a tweet in Hindi. Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan chaired a high-level meeting on Wednesday with all states and Union Territories to review the progress of the Covid-19 vaccination drive. At the meeting, the states were advised to focus on enhancing second dose coverage as well as immunization of school teachers and staff, both government and private. States were apprised on prompt utilisation of Emergency Covid Response Package (ECRP) funds and also advised to ensure compliance of Covid-appropriate behaviour and other precautionary measures ahead of the upcoming festival season. Bhushan stressed on having a definite district-level plan to increase the coverage of the second dose. In line with the announcement made by the Union health minister, more than 2 crore additional vaccine doses will be dispatched to the states from August 27 to 31 to vaccinate school teachers and non-teaching staff on a priority basis, an official release said. States and Union Territories may use Unified District Information System of Education data and co-ordinate with the state education departments, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, Navodaya Vidyalaya Sangathan and others providing a necessary fillip to this vaccination programme, it said. With the 50 per cent fund of ECRP-II package already disbursed to the states and UTs, they were advised to process procurement and supply orders immediately to procure equipment, machinery, beds and drugs in a time-bound manner. At the meeting, the states were also requested to make a month-wise expenditure plan and oversee corresponding physical progress on the ground.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-277

"Under PM @NarendraModi ji's #SabkoVaccineMuftVaccine initiative, India crossed the 60 crore vaccination mark. Congratulations everyone!" he said in a tweet. India took 85 days to touch the figure of 10 crore. It then took 45 days to cross the 20-crore mark and 29 more days to reach 30 crore, the minister informed. The country took 24 days to reach 40 crore from 30 crore and then 20 more days to cross 50 crore vaccinations on August 6. It took 19 more days to go past the 60-crore mark, Mandaviya said. The countrywide vaccination drive was rolled out on January 16 with healthcare workers (HCWs) getting inoculated in the first phase. The vaccination of frontline workers (FLWs) started from February 2. The next phase of COVID-19 vaccination commenced from March 1 for people over 60 years of age and those aged 45 and above with specified co-morbid conditions. The country launched vaccination for all people aged more than 45 years from April 1. The government then decided to expand its vaccination drive by allowing everyone above 18 to be vaccinated from May 1.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-277
25-08-2021||India||Maha govt won’t take coercive action against Narayan Rane on Nashik FIR||The Maharashtra government told the Bombay High Court on Wednesday that it would not take any coercive action against Union Minister Narayan Rane in the FIR lodged in Nashik over his controversial remarks against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar was hearing a petition filed by Rane, seeking to quash the FIR registered in Nashik and all other cases that may be lodged in future. Rane in his plea, submitted before the HC on Tuesday through his advocate Aniket Nikam, also sought interim protection from arrest. The Union minister was arrested on Tuesday afternoon from Maharashtra's Ratnagiri district following his remarks made during his 'Jan Ashirwad Yatra' in Raigad on Monday that he would have slapped Chief Minister Thackeray for what he claimed as the latter's ignorance of the year of India's independence. He was granted bail by a court at Mahad in Raigad late Tuesday night and directed to appear before the office of Alibaug Superintendent of Police on August 30 and September 13. Following his remarks, four FIRs were registered against Rane - in Mahad, Pune, Thane and Nashik. Senior counsel Amit Desai, appearing for the state government, said no coercive action will be taken against Rane in the in the Nashik FIR till September 17, when the plea would be heard. Rane's advocate Satish Maneshinde sought protection in all cases that may arise out of the alleged statement. "We are yet to receive copies of the FIRs lodged in Pune and Thane. We are seeking protection in all cases that may emanate from the alleged press conference," Maneshinde said. Desai, however, said a blanket statement of protection cannot be made as the petition only mentions the Nashik FIR. The high court agreed and posted the matter for further hearing on September 17. The court said the petitioner (Rane) can amend the plea and bring on record all the FIRs. "You (Rane) amend the plea and bring all the FIRs. Then we will consider the issue of protection," Justice Shinde said. Desai told the court that the petitioner (Rane) should also desist from making such statements in future which may have some repercussions in the society. "The government's statement of no coercive action should not be misused and the petitioner should not make more such remarks," Desai said. Maneshinde, however, said he cannot give any such undertaking as the question is about his client's freedom of speech and liberty. Rane in his plea said he was falsely implicated in the case and that he was innocent. He also claimed that by registering multiple FIRs, the state government was causing harassment. "There is a possibility of many more such FIRs to be registered against the petitioner in different parts of the state out of political vengeance and grudge," the plea said. It further said the alleged statement made by him does not attract provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 153-B (1)(c) (remarks likely to cause disharmony, or feeling of enmity or hatred or ill-will). Rane's remarks against CM Thackeay triggered a political row and protests in parts of the state on Tuesday. The FIR in Mahad was registered under IPC sections 189 (threat of injury to public servant), 504 (intentional insult to provoke break of public peace) and 505 (statements conducive to public mischief). The Nashik police have issued a notice to Rane, asking him to appear before them for questioning on September 2 in connection with the FIR registered against him there over his remarks against the CM. The FIR against Rane in Nashik was registered under IPC Sections 500 (defamation), 505(2), (public mischief) and 153(B) (1) (c) (remarks likely to cause disharmony, or feeling of enmity or hatred or ill-will), a police official earlier said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-277
25-08-2021||India||Chidambaram arrives in Goa, to discuss strategy for 2022 polls||Former Union minister and newly-appointed AICC election observer for Goa, P Chidambaram, on Wednesday arrived in the coastal state for a two-day visit during which he is likely to discuss the party's strategy with local leaders for the Assembly polls, due in February next year. A senior Congress leader didn't rule out the possibility of Chidambaram holding pre-poll alliance talks during his visit. This is Chidambaram's maiden visit to Goa after he was appointed the AICC election observer for the coastal state. Earlier in the day, Chidambaram was received at the Goa airport by state Congress chief Girish Chodankar, Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat and other leaders. Chidambaram, however, refused to answer the questions of reporters. Later later I am here, he told media persons. Chidambaram also didn't reply when asked if Congress will retain Girish Chodankar as the Goa unit president or replace him with an eye on polls. Meanwhile, Chodankar didn't rule out the holding of pre-poll alliance talks during Chidambaram's visit. "Everything related to upcoming elections would be discussed," he told PTI when asked about the possibility of Chidambaram holding pre-poll discussions. The Congress won the highest 17 seats in the 40-member House in the 2017 Goa Assembly elections, restricting the main opponent BJP to 13. But the saffron party moved swiftly to ally with regional parties and came to power under the leadership of senior leader Manohar Parrikar, now deceased. Over years, Congress's strength in the Legislative Assembly dwindled to five after many of its MLAs switched sides and joined the ruling BJP. Chodankar had resigned last year after Congress fared poorly in Zilla Panchayat elections in Goa, but the party is yet to accept his resignation. As per speculation, Chodankar is likely to be replaced with another senior leader in the run-up to the Assembly polls. A Goa Congress functionary had said Chidambaram will meet leaders and discuss a party strategy for the polls during his visit. Chidambaram will interact with PCC office-bearers, frontal bodies of Congress, district and block presidents and receive inputs, Goa Pradesh Congress Committee vice president (Organisation) M K Sheikh had said. He will visit the Congress House in Panaji on August 25 and travel to the South Goa District Office of the party for a meeting on August 26, according to Sheikh. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has already thrown its hat in the ring ahead of the polls, with the party's national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announcing free power up to 300 units per month if his party is voted to power during his visit to Panaji in July.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-278
25-08-2021||India||Majority of Indians experienced no or mild side effects after vaccination, says survey||Majority of Indians experienced no or only mild side effects after taking two doses of COVID-19 vaccines Covishield and Covaxin, a survey conducted across the country said. A massive COVID-19 vaccination drive was launched in India on January 16, with two vaccines -- Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, and Covaxin, manufactured by Bharat Biotech. Community social media platform LocalCircles said that according to its nationwide survey, "70 per cent of Indians after taking the first dose of Covishield and 64 per cent with Covaxin experienced no or mild side effects." Similarly, 75 per cent inoculated with the second dose of Covishield and 78 per cent with the second dose of Covaxin experienced no or mild side effects, it added. However, 30 per cent of those who were given the first dose of Covishield experienced side effects. Out of this, 29 per cent experienced fever and 1 per cent reported getting COVID infection, the survey said. Thirty per cent of those who took the first dose of Covaxin experienced fever while 1 per cent reported having a more serious condition than fever, and no one reported having a post vaccine COVID infection, it added. After having the second dose of Covishield, 20 per cent experienced fever, 4 per cent reported getting post vaccine 'COVID infection' and 1 per cent reported having a more serious condition than fever, the survey said. After getting inoculated with the second dose of Covaxin, 17 per cent experienced fever, 2 per cent reported getting post vaccine 'COVID infection' while 3 per cent reported having a more serious condition than fever, it added. "The survey received more than 40,000 responses from citizens residing in 381 districts of India. 62 per cent respondents were men while 38 per cent respondents were women," LocalCircles said. Forty-four per cent respondents were from tier 1, 31 per cent were from tier 2, and 25 per cent respondents were from tier 3, 4 and rural districts, it added. According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, India's COVID-19 vaccination coverage has surpassed the cumulative figure of 59.55 crore as per provisional reports till 7 am on Wednesday.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-278
25-08-2021||India||Afghan nationals must travel to India only on e-Visa henceforth, says Centre||The Union home ministry on Wednesday announced that all Afghan nationals henceforth must travel to India only on e-Visa in view of the prevailing situation in Afghanistan. The decision comes days after the government introduced a new category of visa called "e-Emergency X-Misc visa" for the Afghan nationals after the Taliban captured power in that country. "Owing to the prevailing security situation in Afghanistan and streamlining of the visa process by introduction of the 'e-Emergency X-Misc visa', it has been decided that all Afghan nationals henceforth must travel to India only on e-Visa," a home ministry statement said. The home ministry also announced that keeping in view some reports that certain passports of Afghan nationals have been misplaced, previously issued visas to all Afghan nationals, who are presently not in India, stand invalidated with immediate effect. "Afghan nationals wishing to travel to India may apply for e-Visa," it said. Officials said since Indian missions in Afghanistan are shut, the applications will be examined and processed in New Delhi. The "e-Emergency X-Misc visa" will initially be valid for six months, they said. All Afghans, irrespective of their religion, can apply for the travel document. Thousands of Afghans rushed into Kabul's main airport after the fall of the city to the Taliban, some so desperate to escape the insurgents that they held onto a US military plane as it took off and plunged to their deaths. India has evacuated all its embassy staff and several hundred Indians staying in Afghanistan. New Delhi has also evacuated many Afghans, including two MPs, Hindus and Sikhs who faced threats from the Taliban. The Taliban have already enforced their rule over the capital of five million people after a lightning advance across the country that took just over a week to dethrone the country's Western-backed government in mid-August.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-278
25-08-2021||India||Delta Third Wave unlikely In India with sero-positivity at 86 per cent, say experts ||“I am predicting that, as of now, a Third Wave caused by the highly transmissible Delta variant is most unlikely,” says leading virologist Dr T. Jacob John, former head of ICMR’s Centre for Advanced Research in Virology. John’s firm belief that a Third Wave caused by the Delta variant is unlikely to happen is backed by a CSIR study of its employees which is about to be released. In Delhi, the study found, 86 per cent of its unvaccinated employees and their families who were tested had Covid-19 antibodies. Similarly, Lucknow had high numbers and also Ghaziabad, on Delhi’s outskirts. Says Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, who headed the survey: “It wasn’t unique to Delhi. There were many other places with high numbers.” In Delhi, 850 unvaccinated CSIR employees took part in the survey. Most virologists say that 86 per cent positivity should be enough to create “herd immunity” even for a highly infectious virus like the Delta variant. But there is still the worry of variants that are more dangerous than the Delta emerging over time and experts say the war against Covid-19 is far from won. Virologist Shahid Jameel explains why the earlier herd immunity calculations were thrown out of the window because of the fast-spreading Delta variant. “The better the transmission of any pathogen, the higher is the threshold of herd immunity. The simple fact is that the faster something transmits the more immunity in a population will be required to prevent its spread,” he says. Dr Jameel is director, Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University. Calculations out of gear When the Covid-19 pandemic erupted in 2020, most virologists and epidemiologists predicted that herd immunity would be attained when around 65 per cent to 70 per cent of the population had Covid-19 antibodies. But such calculations were thrown out of gear by the devastating Delta variant. ICMR’s fourth serosurvey conducted between May and early July, showed that 67 per cent of Indians were seropositive or had Covid-19 antibodies. But there were sharp regional variations with 79 per cent of people in Bihar having Covid-19 antibodies and only 44 per cent in Kerala. Since then, there have been further cases and this is certain to have pushed up the percentage of people with Covid-19 antibodies considerably. Hence another serosurvey is being done to gather the latest numbers. Demise of Delta Says John: “Now the question is supposing that serosurvey comes out to be 75 per cent? Will that preclude a third wave?” He continues: “It will preclude a third wave by the Delta variant. That’s because the Delta variant has died or dried out. Because the numbers are not sufficient.” On a similar note, World Health Organization’s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan also in a TV interview said: “India could have reached some sort of endemicity.” She added: “It is feasible we may continue like this with a few local ups and downs.” Still, there remains the worry that more dangerous variants might emerge over the coming months and years. One possibility is the Delta variant antibodies could be ineffective against an even faster-spreading and nasty variant that challenges the effectiveness of existing vaccines. “The virus could mutate and become more lethal,” says Dr Partha Majumder, National Science Chair and distinguished professor, National Institute of Biomedical Genomics. Adds Dr Sandeep Juneja, dean, TIFR School of Technology and Computer Science: “Nobody envisaged the (Delta) variant that was so much more infectious.  That was very unexpected. For a couple of months, we were struggling to understand what was going on.” TIFR collaborated with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to conduct serosurveys in three city wards last year. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said Tuesday it reckoned that the Delta transmission is 1.6 times more than that of the Alpha variant and about twice as much as the original version of the virus. Second wave What’s called the Covid-19 ‘second wave’ began in late March and peaked on May 8 when a staggering 403,405 cases were reported. The number of daily cases fell below 1 lakh on June 7. Different government agencies have, however, forecast that a third wave could be round the corner. A Home Ministry panel warned on Monday that a Covid-19 pandemic could peak in October and might impact children more than in previous waves. Children are considered a “vulnerable population” as vaccinations for kids has not yet begun. The ministry recommended that paediatric wards get ready for such a contingency. More cautiously, Samiran Panda, chief of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research last month told The Hindu that a third wave, “is a distinct possibility although not inevitable as it is dependent on the scale and quality of appropriate public health measures.” He predicted this could possibly begin anywhere between August and October. No permanent herd immunity The CSIR study also points out that, “despite high seropositivity, Delhi was amongst the most affected cities during the second wave.” Adds Agrawal: “To create an outbreak in a city with such high antibodies you need something that will break through immunity.” However, he warns: “As we know by now there is nothing called permanent herd immunity. Our paper speaks of reinfections.” The study showed that 27 per cent of the cases were reinfections. At the other end of the spectrum, the CSIR survey reckons that seropositivity is still low in Kerala because the state was able to control infections there. Jameel points out crucially that a serosurvey only measures the presence of antibodies and that can be different from having immunity. “Just having antibodies doesn’t mean that you are protected. It depends on the quality of the antibody. It depends on whether you have good neutralising antibodies and good titres,” he said. “None of that information comes from a serosurvey. A serosurvey only tells you that 67 per cent of India on average has been exposed to the virus. It doesn’t mean 67 per cent is protected from the virus.” John, however, is confident that the Delta variant has done its worst in India. “I am predicting that as of now the third wave by the Delta variant is most unlikely.” He said there will be no further wave “unless a new variant appears on the scene.” Pace of vaccination In addition to the people infected by the Delta variant, in the last few months, the pace of vaccinations has also been picking up. John is highly critical of the vaccine programme, pointing out that only 13 per cent of the total population has received two doses. “Seven months after the approval of the vaccine, this is most disappointing,” he says. Nobody believes Covid-19 is about to do a disappearing act. One expert predicts: “It will slowly turn into influenza. It is here to stay and not about to vanish.” There could also be a dire scenario that could put us back at square one and undercut all the country’s Covid-control efforts. Says Juneja: “There is also a bad scenario: a variant that doesn’t respect any immunity we currently have.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-278
25-08-2021||India||Supreme Court asks Delhi HC to decide on Rakesh Asthana's appointment as top cop within 2 weeks||The Supreme Court Wednesday asked the Delhi High Court to decide within two weeks the plea pending before it challenging the appointment of senior IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as the Delhi Police Commissioner. The 1984-batch IPS officer, who had shifted to Union cadre from Gujarat and was earlier serving as the director general of Border Security Force, was appointed Delhi Police Commissioner on July 27, four days before his superannuation on July 31. He will have a tenure of one year as the police chief of the national capital. A bench comprising Chief Justice N V Ramana and justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant permitted NGO 'Centre for Public Interest Litigation' (CPIL) to move to the Delhi High Court to intervene in the pending plea against the appointment of Asthana. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said that some more time be given to the high court as the government will have to file its response to the pending plea there. The petition, moved by advocate Prashant Bhushan, urged the court to set aside the Centre's order to appoint Asthana after extending his service period.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-278
25-08-2021||India||Modi says India firmly committed to move forward with goal of clean, modern mobility||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said holistic steps are being taken for the value chain associated with automobile manufacturing so that the industry becomes more productive and sustainable. In a message to the auto industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) on its 61st Annual Convention, the Prime Minister also stated that India remained firmly committed to moving forward with the goal of clean and modern mobility while lauding the role of the industry in the country's progress. "The role of the automobile industry in India's economy and progress has been remarkable. From contributing significantly towards manufacturing to furthering exports, from creating numerous employment opportunities to adding to the ease of living for people, the sector has been a partner in India's growth story," Modi wrote in his message which was read out by SIAM President Kenichi Ayukawa. He further said, "Even during the nation's fight against COVID-19, the sensitive and active effort of the sector is deeply valued." Stating that modernity in mobility brings about a positive impact in almost every industry and every sector of the country, Modi said, "The 21st century India remains firmly committed to move forward with the goal of clean and modern mobility. Holistic steps are being taken for the value chain associated with auto manufacturing so that the industry becomes more productive and sustainable." He also reassured the auto industry that "all the stakeholders have an important role in our government's steadfast efforts to transform India into a global manufacturing hub". The presence of manufacturing units of global automobile manufacturers in India is reflective of a thriving ecosystem, Modi added. Reiterating that there are rapid changes taking place in technology, lifestyle and economy and old approaches and old practices have to be changed, he said "It is also crucial to protect our environment, resources and raw materials." For this reason, Modi said, "India is not only emphasizing on exploring new possibilities but also encouraging a circular economy. Recently launched National Automobile Scrappage Policy exemplifies this vision." The Prime Minister said as India celebrates the 75 years of Independence, the next 25 years are very important for the country. "We have to work together for the next generation infrastructure, world class manufacturing and new age technology. India is committed to providing its citizens with global standards in terms of quality and safety," he asserted.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-278
25-08-2021||India||Maharashtra court grants bail to Narayan Rane||A court at Mahad in Maharashtra while granting bail to Union Minister Narayan Rane said his arrest over his controversial remarks against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was justified, but his custodial interrogation was not necessary. The order was passed by the court late Tuesday night and a detailed copy of it was made available on Wednesday. "Considering the reason for the arrest and other reasons, I found that the arrest is justified," magistrate S S Patil said in the order. The court noted that while a few sections under which Rane was booked were non-bailable, they were not punishable with life or death. Considering these factors, no prejudice would be caused to the prosecution if the accused is released on bail, the court said, adding that "the accused shall not commit a similar type of offence". Rane was arrested on Tuesday afternoon from Ratnagiri district in Maharashtra following his remarks that he would have slapped Chief Minister Thackeray for what he claimed as the latter's ignorance of the year of India's independence. The Union minister was produced before magistrate Patil at Mahad in Raigad on Tuesday night. The police sought his custody for seven days, which the court refused and remanded him to judicial custody till September 4. Rane's advocates then moved a bail application. The plea was heard and Rane was granted bail on a surety of Rs 15,000. He was directed to appear at the office of the Superintendent of Police in Alibaug (Raigad) on August 30 and September 13. Rane's advocate Rajendra Shirodkar argued that the police had not followed the mandate of law laid down under Section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which says in cases where the arrest is not warranted, the police ought to first issue a notice/summons to the accused for questioning. However, the court in its order noted that in this particular section there are grounds given when the police officer can arrest a person without notice/summons. The magistrate, while refusing to grant Rane's custody to the police, noted that the alleged statement of the accused (Rane) was made before the media. "The informant (complainant in the case) himself alleged in the FIR that the accused made the statement before the media and it was viral on social media. Considering the nature of the offence, I do not find it necessary to hand over the accused in police custody," the magistrate said in the order. While arguing on Rane's bail plea, Shirodkar told the court that the accused was a senior citizen with roots in the society and hence, would not abscond. He further told the court that he had advised his client (Rane) not to make such statements in public in future, but Rane did not concede to such an undertaking quoting his liberty. The police opposed the bail plea, arguing that the accused was a Union cabinet minister and was making such irresponsible statements which would create disharmony in the society. The court in its order directed Rane to cooperate with the probe into the case and if police want a voice sample of the minister, then he (Rane) shall assist. The only rider is that the police shall give seven-day prior notice to the accused, it said. The court also noted that the police had not followed directions given by the Bombay High Court with regard to maintaining a proper case diary. Admittedly, the case diary produced before me are two papers which are not paginated, the magistrate said. Rane faces four FIRs in Maharashtra over his remarks, which triggered a political row and protests across the state on Tuesday. The FIR at Mahad was registered under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 189 (threat of injury to public servant), 504 (intentional insult to provoke break of public peace) and 505 (statements conducive to public mischief).||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-278

25-08-2021||India||Woman who had set herself ablaze outside Supreme Court dies||A 24-year-old woman who had set herself on fire along with a man outside the Supreme Court here died on Tuesday, police said. The body was handed over to her family after post-mortem following which they cremated her at the Nigambodh Ghat here, they said. The woman had suffered 85 per cent burns in the incident on August 16. The man, 27, had suffered 65 per cent burns and succumbed to injuries on Saturday. Both were admitted to the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, police said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav said, "The woman succumbed to injuries during the course of treatment on Tuesday." Following the incident, police had registered a case under Section 309 (attempt to commit suicide) of the Indian Penal Code. They suspected that the man had convinced the woman to take the extreme step. Police said she was from Uttar Pradesh''s Ghazipur and was allegedly raped by Bahujan Samaj Party MP Atul Rai in 2019. The MP has been in judicial custody in the case for the last two years, police said. According to police, before attempting suicide, the woman, together with her associate, had recorded a Facebook Live video in which she disclosed her identity and claimed that she had filed the rape case against Rai in 2019. She had alleged that some senior Uttar Pradesh police officers were supporting the accused. Earlier, a senior police officer had said that the man and the woman took the extreme step as a court had issued a non-bailable warrant against them in a case of forgery for allegedly submitting wrong proof of age in the rape case. In her Facebook video, the woman had mentioned the warrant and that she had been summoned by the judge, police said. According to police, in March, the woman had filed a plea in the Supreme Court, seeking transfer of her rape case from Allahabad to Delhi for a fair trial and claimed that she faced a threat to her life. Later in August, a local court in Varanasi issued a non-bailable warrant against her in the forgery case based on a complaint filed by Rai's brother, they said. Following the suicide attempt, two Varanasi policemen including Varanasi Cantt SHO Rakesh Singh and investigation officer Girija Shankar, probing the case of forgery against the rape victim were suspended and an inquiry was initiated into the matter, police had said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-278

25-08-2021||India||Rahul alerts India’s youth to 'sale of national assets'||Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday asked every patriotic Indian to oppose the “sale of national assets” and accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of “attacking the future” of India’s youth to help a handful of industrialists. “Modi is not a Prime Minister. He is an instrument for doing a particular job for a few industrialists. He is attacking the future of our youth to serve the interests of three-four industrialists,” the Congress leader told a news conference. “Narendra Modiji ka ek aur BJP ka ek naara tha, ‘Sattar saal mein kuchh nahin hua’. Aur kal finance minister ne jo bhi sattar saal mein iss desh ki poonji bani thi usko bechne ka decision le liya. Matlab Pradhan Mantri ne sab kuchh bech diya (Narendra Modiji and the BJP had a slogan, that nothing was done in 70 years. And yesterday the finance minister took the decision to sell whatever wealth the country had created in 70 years. Meaning, the Prime Minister has sold everything),” he added. Rahul was referring to the government’s plans to farm out a vast trove of infrastructure assets to the private sector, announced on Monday. The Congress MP described the move as a direct fallout of the mishandling of the economy by the Modi government and a clear sign that it did not know what to do. “As a last resort, they are selling everything that we had helped create,” he added. Rahul contended that the youth would not get jobs after Modi succeeded in creating huge monopolies. “The whole idea behind this is to create monopolies... for three or four people. And my young friends who are today searching for a job cannot find a job… The reason you cannot find a job is that the entire small and medium industries are destroyed because the Prime Minister insists on building two or three monopolies that own everything in this country,” he said. “This is not just a gifting of India’s assets. This is going to ensure that the young people of India will not be able to find employment in the future.” Underlining that when he had warned about the coronavirus, he was ridiculed, Rahul added: “This thing (the farming out of assets) is going to ensure our young people do not get jobs. This is going to ensure that our entire industrial structure is controlled by two or three people. “So as a youngster, it is your duty, and my duty, to fight this and to make people understand what the Prime Minister is doing. The Prime Minister is not working for the people of India. The Prime Minister is working for two or three monopolists.” The Congress leader warned of profound social consequences. “When you cannot give jobs to people, it leads to social tension, social anger and then social explosion. So you will see dramatic increase in violence, a dramatic increase in anger, millions of youngsters who simply cannot have a future, who will look at the houses of these monopolists and wonder what went wrong with India. That is what is happening.” Rahul equated the Prime Minister’s perceived belief that a few large monopolists can transform India with the situation that led to the enslavement of India by the East India Company. “This is very dangerous for India. We saw a monopoly that the East India Company was. It enslaved India. We are again moving towards slavery. It is a huge tragedy. I urge every patriotic person, every nationalist, to oppose this. It is my duty and the duty of the youth to fight it.” Rahul dismissed the government’s claim that infrastructure assets that had been languishing were being used for resource mobilisation. “(Are) the railways languishing? Are trains not in use? National highways, telecom, gas pipelines, warehouses, the power sector — (all) languishing?” he said. Rahul contended that Modi’s policies were aimed at creating monopolies in the formal sector while destroying the informal sector. He countered the Centre’s argument that the assets were not being sold and only leased out, with the ownership remaining with the government. “Leasing is an excuse. The Indian people have put in thousands and thousands of crores of rupees to create such assets. Now you are going to take a little bit of rent and gift the assets to these people. “They don’t have the courage to say, ‘We are selling’. Who knows what will happen after 40 years? So the discussion on ownership will begin after 40 years. By that time the game is over. The reality is, Modi is gifting national assets built with enormous resources and labour by Indians to his friends.” Explaining the Congress perspective on privatisation, he said: “We had a logic. Strategic assets will never be privatised. We consider the railways strategic because (they are) the backbone of India and give jobs to a large number of people.” He added: “We sold industries which were chronically loss-making, had minimal market share and didn’t create private monopolies. All small and medium enterprises will (now) close down because of huge monopolies and jobs will disappear.” Without naming any industrialists, he said: “We all know who the airports and ports are going to. We know who is interested in warehouses. All these assets will go to three-four people.” Rahul wondered how the government decision would affect reservations and asked the Congress to examine the issues involved in detail and present its findings to the people. Former finance minister P. Chidambaram, who too was at the news conference, said: “What are the goals (of the handover exercise), what is the consultation with the stakeholders? They say they want to raise money. Can that be a goal in itself?” He added: “Can you sell assets built over 70 years with humongous amounts of money to raise money? It is closing-down sale. Virtually no public sector will remain after this.” Chidambaram, known as a champion of the free market and an advocate of privatisation, went on: “The government will get (Rs) 6 lakh crore in four years. The Prime Minister announced repeatedly that the national infrastructure project is worth Rs 100 lakh crore. What mathematics is this? This is a scandal. Unions, workers, the youth, citizens must start debating this. This is dangerous. The country must wake up.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-279
25-08-2021||India||Maha police arrests Narayan Rane for 'slap' threat to Uddhav ||Maharashtra police arrested Union minister Narayan Rane on Tuesday afternoon, the dramatic development threatening to escalate the war between the BJP and the Shiv Sena and wreck the oft-speculated possibility of a reconciliation between the estranged allies. The arrest in Maharashtra came after Rane threatened to “slap” chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a speech on Monday night at a rally over the Sena leader’s Independence Day address. Rane was granted bail by a local court on Tuesday night. Rane was arrested at former RSS chief M.S. Golwalkar’s ancestral village of Golwali in Ratnagiri district. Maharashtra’s ruling coalition, always on tenterhooks over the recurring conjectures about a Sena-BJP patch-up, exhaled in relief while gearing for retribution from the Centre over the state government’s challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s authority. Both the NCP and the Congress stayed off the controversy but condemned Rane’s indiscreet remarks. “(Uddhav) Thackeray forgot the year of India’s Independence during his August 15 address and had to check with his aide mid-speech,” Rane, Union minister of micro, small and medium enterprises, had said. “It’s shameful that the chief minister doesn’t know the year of Independence. He leaned back to ask about the count of years since Independence during his speech. Had I been there, I would have given him a tight slap.” Rane, 69, a former Shiv Sena chief minister of Maharashtra who had come to the BJP via the Congress, was arrested after a sessions court in Ratnagiri rejected his plea for anticipatory bail and Bombay High Court denied him protection. Earlier, as Sena workers filed a series of FIRs against him, Rane had boasted he couldn’t be arrested as he was no “normal (ordinary) man”. There’s no legal bar to arresting a Union minister or an MP. The police will now have to inform Rajya Sabha Chairperson M. Venkaiah Naidu of the arrest. Although Centre-state confrontations have become routine at a time central agencies have been raiding Opposition politicians at the drop of a hat, a Union minister’s arrest is a rare occurrence. Chennai police had under the late Jayalalithaa arrested sitting Union ministers T.R. Balu and Murasoli Maran two decades ago. Union ministers like Kalpnath Rai, Sukh Ram and A. Raja had been arrested in corruption cases only after quitting their posts. A Congress leader gleefully argued that the rising tensions were political insurance for the state government. “Modi either digests this insult or burns his bridges with Uddhav; the choice is his,” he said. Rane’s comments touched a raw nerve among Shiv Sainiks because they were seen as a show of disrespect for the Thackeray family. Sena workers burst crackers and danced on the streets after his arrest. Shiv Sena MP Vinayak Raut has written to Modi demanding Rane be sacked for his remarks against Uddhav. Rane, who had been chief minister for a few months in 1999 with Balasaheb Thackeray’s blessings, quit the Sena in 2005 amid serious differences with the family, joined the Congress and held cabinet positions. He left the Congress to float his own party in 2017 before joining the BJP in 2018. The state BJP, which lacks much emotional attachment to the former Congress leader, initially appeared uninterested in protesting his arrest after distancing itself from the “slap” remark. Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that though he disapproved of Rane’s comment, he was “personally” with Rane in this crisis. However, the Centre cannot take the issue lightly. Earlier, when the Uddhav government had arrested TV anchor and BJP favourite Arnab Goswami, the ruling dispensation at the Centre had hit back hard, forcing the exit of state home minister Anil Deshmukh.

25-08-2021||India||Modi talks to Putin on Afghanistan situation ahead of G7 meet ||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin conversed over the phone ahead of Tuesday evening’s G7 meeting on the Afghan situation, and decided to establish a permanent channel of communication between their countries for bilateral consultations on Afghanistan. “Had a detailed and useful exchange of views with my friend President Putin on recent developments in Afghanistan,” Modi tweeted. “We also discussed issues on the bilateral agenda, including India-Russia cooperation against Covid-19. We agreed to continue close consultations on important issues.” The tweet was silent on the permanent channel of communication, which was later mentioned by the Kremlin in a statement that was translated by the Indian embassy in Moscow. “During the exchange of views on the situation in Afghanistan, the importance of coordinated efforts contributing to the establishment of peace and stability in the country, ensuring security in the region as a whole, was noted,” the Kremlin said. “The intention was to increase cooperation in countering the spread of terrorist ideology and the drug threat emanating from the territory of Afghanistan. It was agreed to form a permanent bilateral channel of consultations on this issue.” The Modi-Putin conversation was India’s first high-level engagement with regional stakeholders in Afghanistan. The Indian deputy national security adviser had met his counterpart in Moscow last week and discussed Afghanistan. Russia is among the few countries that have kept their missions in Kabul operational. Just as India fears that the Taliban’s control over Afghanistan might give a fillip to anti-India terrorist organisations, Moscow wants to secure its allies in Central Asia. As head of the Moscow-led military alliance — the Collective Security Treaty Organisation — Russia is obligated to ensure the defence of its allies. Although the Taliban are a banned organisation in Russia, the two have met —  including once in Moscow —  and the Islamist outfit has promised not to violate the borders of the Central Asian countries. While addressing the special session of the Human Rights Council on Afghanistan in Geneva, India’s permanent representative to the UN there, Indra Mani Pandey, said: “We hope the situation in Afghanistan does not pose a challenge to its neighbours and its territory is not used by terrorist groups such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Jaish-e-Mohammed to threaten any other country.” On Afghanistan’s future, Pandey iterated that India hopes for an “inclusive and broad-based dispensation which represents all sections of Afghan society”. “Voices of Afghan women, aspirations of Afghan children and the rights of minorities must be respected. A broad-based representation would help the arrangement gain more acceptability and legitimacy,” he said. India has given the name “Operation Devi Shakti” to its evacuation/ repatriation exercise from Kabul. Another flight has brought in 78 evacuees via Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Among them were 44 Afghan Sikhs who brought along with them three Guru Granth Sahibs. Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri was at the airport to receive one of the Guru Granth Sahibs, which were taken in a procession to the Guru Arjan Dev Gurdwara at New Mahavir Nagar.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-279
25-08-2021||India||Covid: Kerala HC seeks explanation on Covishield 84 day dose gap||Kerala High Court has issued a notice to the Union health ministry seeking an explanation why the minimum gap between two doses of the Covishield vaccine, the most widely used in India’s inoculation campaign, is 84 days in most cases. “The court asked the government whether the 84-day gap had been prescribed because of increased efficacy or shortage of vaccines,” said senior counsel Blaze K. Jose, who appeared for Kitex Garments Ltd. The court issued the notice after hearing a petition filed by Kitex, one of the biggest garment manufacturers in Kerala, which has sought permission to administer about 10,000 second doses of Covishield to its employees and their family members at a shorter interval. Jose told The Telegraph after Tuesday’s hearing that the sole argument the petitioner had offered was about the discrimination being made between segments of the population in determining the gap between the two doses. “Our only argument is that since sections of the population, such as those travelling abroad for studies and work, are being allowed to take two shots 28 days apart, why not allow those who are ready to purchase vaccines to follow the same regime?” Jose said. The case was adjourned to Thursday for the government to respond. Sajeev T.K., general manager of Kitex Garments, which is based at Kizhakkambalam in Ernakulam district, said the company had bought 10,000 doses of Covishield about a month ago to administer second shots. The doses were brought through a private hospital. The vaccine stocks are lying in the cold storage of the hospital at Muvattupuzha in Ernakulam. The company had administered the first dose to its employees and their family members in June. “No amount of requests to the state health department or the district medical officer has been of any help in speeding up the second dose. That’s why we went to court, seeking the same relaxation allowed to some sections of the population,” Sajeev told this newspaper. Sajeev questioned the logic of allowing a certain segment of the population to take two doses in under a month while the majority was being made to wait 84 days. “We are not asking for free vaccines. In fact, we are also paying the hospital a service fee of Rs 150 per dose from our coffers. All we need is permission to administer the second dose so that all our employees and their kin feel that much safer,” Sajeev said. Kitex has around 7,000 employees, many of them in the tailoring units. The company is apprehensive about outbreaks at the units in the absence of complete vaccination. “We have a fully certified vaccination centre that meets all parameters prescribed by the health department. The centre has resting areas and even facilities to handle any emergency. I don’t understand the government’s obstinacy in not reducing the gap, especially with Covid cases so high in Kerala and a third wave appearing imminent,” he added. Kerala has been reporting the highest number of daily Covid cases in the country for over a month, with the figures mostly staying above 20,000. Although the fatality rate is low at 0.51 per cent, the test positivity rate has remained high — around 15-18 per cent.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-279
25-08-2021||India||Scientists discover mathematical law in how elephants use trunks||Scientists have discovered a mathematical law in how elephants use their trunks and a physics principle in how ants build underground tunnels. The researchers said these studies could throw up lessons in engineering from the natural world. Two research groups independently announced on Monday the results of efforts by one to probe the biomechanics of trunk manipulation by elephants and by the other to investigate how ants build complex networks of tunnels to create underground cities. Biologist Michel Milinkovitch and his colleagues at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, have found that the myriad movements of an elephant’s trunk emerge from a combination of a set of around 20 basic movements, such as the propagation of inward curvature and the formation of virtual joints. While elephant trunks are continuous and flexible along their entire length, coordinated contractions of the muscles during trunk movements lead to twisting, bending, lengthening and stiffening without any bone support. The Geneva group has found that elephants use a unique strategy to reach for objects on their sides — they turn their otherwise flexible and continuous trunk into rigid segments as if connected by joints, just like the human elbow or the wrist. The scientists have also found that the trunk obeys a mathematical law similar to one observed in human hand drawings. “How much the trunk slows down when following a curve can be predicted precisely on the basis of local curvature on that path,” Milinkovitch said in a media release from the university. “Remarkably, such a mathematical relation between speed and path curvature also exists for human hand drawings.” The researchers, who have published their findings in the journal Current Biology, said their results could find use in the development of bio-inspired robots that could detect, reach, grasp or manipulate objects using elephant trunk mechanics. At the California Institute of Technology in the US, civil engineer Jose Andrade and his colleagues used 3D X-ray CT imaging devices and other equipment to observe ant tunnelling mechanisms. They expect their findings to help in robotic excavations. “Subterranean-nesting ants execute an innate tunnelling behavioural programme that can lead to remarkably stable tunnel excavation,” the researchers said, describing their findings in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In laboratory setups intended to mimic underground soil, the scientists observed that the ants tried to be as efficient as possible. They dug their tunnels as straight as possible and as steeply as they could, right up to what engineers would call the “angle of repose”. The angle of repose is the steepest angle at which a granular material — such as soil grains — can be piled up before it all collapses. Ants appear to sense how steep that angle is for whatever they’re digging through and do not exceed that angle, Andrade said in a media release from the university. The scientists also found something that could help engineers in tunnel building. As the ants remove soil grains, they cause a rearrangement in the force chains around the tunnel, strengthening the tunnel walls and relieving the pressure at the end of the tunnel, allowing safer excavation. But, the scientists say, how hundreds of ants work in unison during tunnel construction remains unknown. They believe the digging plan does not exist within any single ant. “It is emergent colony behaviour of all these workers acting like a super-organism,” Andrade said. “How that behaviour is spread across the tiny brains of all these ants is a wonder of the natural world we have no explanation for.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-279
25-08-2021||India||Bhupender Yadav launches logo of National Database of Unorganised Workers||Mohammad Arif, a wedding singer from Meerut who is paralysed below the waist, has had no work since the Covid second wave hit in early summer. The 48-year-old father of five used to sing at weddings sitting in a chair and earned about Rs 7,500 a month. His wife Sayeeda, who has a paralysed right arm, is a homemaker. Arif is happy that the Centre will on Thursday start registering informal workers to create a long-awaited national database, but said the government “must also ensure that workers, particularly urban workers, get work”. “The database is a good initiative. But there should also be job schemes for the urban poor,” he said. Labour minister Bhupender Yadav on Tuesday launched the logo of the new portal for the creation of the National Database of Unorganised Workers (NDUW). A presentation made at the meeting said every registered worker would get a unique 12-digit number and be linked to the government’s social security schemes. The huge exercise, which aims to register the country’s estimated 38 crore unorganised-sector workers, will be spearheaded by the states in collaboration with the trade unions. Tapan Sen from CPM workers’ wing Citu said several past laws like the Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act, 1979, and the Building and Other Construction Workers Act, 1996, too mandated the registration of all the workers in their domains but were never implemented properly. The absence of such registration had deepened the stranded migrant workers’ misery during last year’s lockdown, hobbling efforts to reach them with food and relief. “This database is being created because of a Supreme Court directive,” Sen said. He cautioned that the government should do everything to make the database thorough, especially with the apex court having set a short deadline of December 31 for its completion. Ashok Singh of Congress labour arm Intuc too said the government should start a job scheme for urban people on the lines of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. “Unorganised-sector workers, including migrant workers, make up 90 per cent of the workforce. A database of workers is important,” he said. “But some income assurance opportunities too must be started to help them during a lean period,” Singh said. A parliamentary standing committee on labour has supported the idea of an urban employment scheme similar to the MGNREGA. Amarjeet Kaur, a leader of CPI labour arm Aituc, said the government must not rely on the existing but incomplete databases maintained by its workers’ boards. “The existing data with the construction workers’ board or the beedi workers’ federation cover only 10 to 15 per cent of the workers in these fields,” she said. “The new database should be a fresh exercise covering all.” Arif got his Ayushman Bharat card just four days ago, three years after the Centre launched the health insurance scheme that aims to cover 10 crore poor families. He hopes the NDUW card will not take that long.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-279
25-08-2021||India||Gupkar alliance warns Centre against humiliation of Kashmiris||The six-party alliance fighting for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on Tuesday warned the Centre of “harmful” consequences if it continued to “humiliate” Kashmiris. The alliance leaders stepped up the ante three days after PDP leader and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti referred to the developments in the neighbourhood while telling the Centre to rectify its “mistake” in Kashmir, appearing to refer to the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. The leaders of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration who met on Tuesday at chairman Farooq Abdullah’s residence did not mention the happenings in Afghanistan but sent out a stern warning to the Centre and criticised the judiciary for the alleged delay in starting the proceedings in petitions challenging the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status. “We will take this petition (seeking redress of issues related to Kashmir) to the country and its people. Through you, we are telling civil society, media houses, journalists and Parliament that Kashmiris are being humiliated. It should stop. Its consequences won’t be good but harmful for the country and the people of Jammu and Kashmir,” alliance spokesman and CPM veteran M.Y. Tarigami told reporters after the meeting in the presence of Farooq, Mehbooba and other leaders. Tarigami said the people of Jammu and Kashmir wanted their rights and also to live like others, with their heads held high. “We don’t want a life of humiliation. The government has pledged that it will continue to humiliate us. They see our humiliation as their glory, which is not acceptable to us,” he said. In a resolution, the Gupkar alliance said the August 5, 2019, decision to nullify Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and turn it into two Union Territories, the other being Ladakh, had created a big political void and deep uncertainty. “It is most unfortunate that the judicial challenges against this abrogation as a violation of the Constitution continue to remain pending before the Supreme Court even after two years,” the resolution said. The court is hearing multiple petitions challenging the decisions. The resolution said suppression of civil liberties and democratic rights continued unabated in Jammu and Kashmir as hundreds remained in detention although charges had not been framed under the anti-terror UAPA and the Public Safety Act. “New orders are being passed like non-clearance of passports and government services to anyone involved in ‘law and order’ or ‘stone pelting cases’. This negates the principle of natural justice by equating a police report with being guilty and being denied all these services. Jurisprudence underlines that everyone is innocent till proven guilty,” the alliance resolution said. It said the protection of jobs and land rights had been snatched arbitrarily from locals, which had deepened the sense of insecurity.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-279
25-08-2021||India||Many OBC students miss out on scholarship for higher education||Thousands of Other Backward Class students are missing out on a scholarship for higher education because the government hasn’t taken the trouble to tell them about it. Thousands of others are being denied the assistance because of a stringent income cut-off. Pankaj Kumar of Rupsagar village in Bihar’s Buxar district had not even heard of the Post-Matric Scholarship when he needed the money the most. Nor would it have helped if he had. For his parental income was higher than the threshold Rs 1.5 lakh a year, making him ineligible for the scholarship. Pankaj is the eldest of the three children of a clerk in the Bihar government’s irrigation department. His father, however, could not pay for his higher studies in Delhi after he finished his schooling from a Bihar government school. “I worked with the administrative wing of a Delhi NGO to pay for my living and study expenses. Had I got the scholarship, I would have performed better in my exams,” Pankaj said. After earning his BA from Dyal Singh College, Delhi University, Pankaj did his LLB from Delhi University’s faculty of law and is now an intern with a Delhi law firm. He has been selected for the LLM course this year. “I’m the first in my family to study at a central university. Apart from the issue of eligibility, nobody had ever told me about this scholarship,” he said. “Many of my friends in Bihar who would have met the income cut-off never applied because they hadn’t heard of it, either.” While the income threshold is Rs 1.5 lakh for OBC students, it’s Rs 2.5 lakh a year under the Post-Matric Scholarship scheme for Scheduled Caste students. For Rosalini and Rubina, daughters of Prasanna Pradhan, an OBC farmer from Kapileswarpur village in Odisha’s Puri district, the problem has solely been of a lack of awareness. Rosalini is a BA student at Puri’s SCS College while Rubina is enrolled in the Plus II course. Prasanna said he had to borrow from neighbours to pay for his daughters’ education. Had the sisters applied with all the necessary documents for the scholarship, the elder would have received a monthly aid of Rs 400 and the younger, Rs 260. Hostel boarders are eligible for Rs 260 to Rs 750 a month — depending on the  course — while day scholars get Rs 160 to Rs 260. Both sisters are in  hostel. “I didn’t know of any scholarship for OBC students to pursue higher studies,” Prasanna said. An official said the Odisha government’s ST & SC development, minorities and backward classes welfare department uploads the details of all scholarships on its website. OBC activists, however, said the central and state governments should do much more to spread awareness about the scholarship. “When OBC students are in school, we take the initiative to get them to fill in the application forms for the Pre-Matric Scholarship and attach the necessary documents,” Dwarikanath Biswal, a teacher at the Atibadi Jagannath Das High School in Puri district, said. “But once they leave school after the board exams, they don’t get any guidance  and mostly don’t apply.” Biswal’s comments carry an ominous implication at a time schools have been closed because of the pandemic. Rabi Behera, president of the Samajwadi Party’s Odisha unit, blamed the “indifference” of the bureaucrats their political masters and the colleges. “The Scheduled Castes are well aware of the Post-Matric Scholarship meant for them because it’s been there from before Independence,” he said. “But the equivalent scholarship for OBCs was started in 1998.” Nearly 60 lakh Dalit students got the Post-Matric Scholarship in 2019-20 while only 41 lakh OBCs did. Behera said OBCs made up 43 per cent of the country’s population while the Dalits were 16.6 per cent. According to the official All India Survey on Higher Education, 3.85 crore students were enrolled in higher education, of whom 1.42 crore (36.9 per cent) were OBCs and 56.57 lakh (14.7 per cent) were Dalit.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-279
25-08-2021||India||Centre opposes Bombay High Court skin contact sexual assault verdict||The Centre on Tuesday told the Supreme Court the much-criticised Bombay High Court ruling that groping a child’s breasts without “skin-to-skin contact” did not amount to sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act was “outrageous” and would have “far-reaching consequences” if not quashed. “For tomorrow, any person who wears a surgical glove and feels the entire body of a woman… without penetration, then the minimum punishment of three years wouldn’t apply to him. This is outrageous. The judge clearly didn’t see the far-reaching consequences,” attorney-general K.K. Venugopal told an apex court bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and Ajay Rastogi. The Supreme Court had in January stayed the judgment passed by Justice Pushpa Ganediwala, acquitting a man convicted of pressing the breasts of a 12-year-old over her dress. The Centre had rushed to the top court, seeking a stay on the judgment. When the matter came up for hearing on Tuesday, Venugopal argued that the high court order could not be sustained as the legislative intent of the Pocso Act would be defeated. He pointed out that in the past one year, 43,000 Pocso-related cases had been filed, indicating that there was a rising trend of sexual assault on children. “It’s an outrageous judgment so far as Pocso is concerned. She (the judge) said skin-to-skin contact is required, which would result in a person wearing gloves and getting an acquittal,” Venugopal said. “…The girl was taken by the man, (he) touched her breast and pulled her salwar. (She) yelled. The mother found her daughter and filed a complaint,” the AG said, reading out from the high court judgment. The Maharashtra government had challenged a similar verdict by Bombay High Court in another case, which was also listed before the top court. In the second case, also heard by Justice Ganediwala, the high court had ruled that an accused opening the zip of his trousers before a five-year-old girl would not amount to sexual assault under the Pocso Act. The Supreme Court adjourned the two matters till September 14 as the accused persons were not represented by any lawyer despite notices being served on the duo in January. The court had earlier appointed senior advocate Sidharth Dave as an amicus curiae to assist it in the matter. The Supreme Court passed the following order: “According to the Office Report dated 23.08.2021, service of show-cause notice is complete in all the matters. However, none has entered appearance on behalf of the accused. Since the accused are not being represented, we direct the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee… to make available services of any Senior Advocate from the Panel of the Committee along with any other Advocate-on-Record to appear on behalf of the accused. “It may be stated here that there are two sets of accused in these matters. It will be entirely up to the Committee to have different sets of Counsel representing the accused or to have the same set of Counsel representing the cause of all the accused. “Let the papers be submitted to the Committee today itself to enable it to take appropriate steps in the matter. List all these matters for final disposal on 14.09.2021.” Justice Ganediwala’s judgments in January had triggered outrage among the civil society and women’s rights organisations. In the first case, Satish had been handed a three-year jail term by a lower court for sexually assaulting the 12-year-old girl. But Justice Ganediwala of the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court had ruled there must be “skin-to-skin contact with sexual intent” for it to be considered sexual assault under the Pocso Act. “The act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years, in the absence of any specific detail as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hand inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of sexual assault,” the judge had said. However, Justice Ganediwala had added that under the Indian Penal Code’s Section 354 (assault or criminal force to outrage a woman’s modesty), “the act of pressing breast can be a criminal force to a woman/ girl with the intention to outrage her modesty”. Punishments for sexual assault under the IPC tend to be lighter compared to those for similar offences under the Pocso Act. In the other case, Justice Ganediwala had acquitted a 50-year-old man of charges under the Pocso Act on the ground that the offence of opening his trousers’ zip before the five-year-old girl did not invite an offence under this law since there was no actual penetration. A trial court had sentenced the man to five years’ imprisonment under the Pocso Act. The high court had, however, sentenced him to five months in jail for outraging the girl’s modesty.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-279
25-08-2021||India||Veterans question Rajnath Singh's defence manufacturing hub claim||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said India would emerge as the defence manufacturing hub of the world under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, prompting some veterans to point to India’s still-nascent indigenous capabilities in production. Addressing a gathering on the handing-over ceremony of “Made in India” multi-mode grenades to the Indian Army in Nagpur, Rajnath said: “The speed with which our industries are progressing and contributing to our defence production, I am sure soon India will become the defence manufacturing hub of the world.” The hand grenades have been manufactured by the Nagpur-based Economic Explosive Ltd, a private entity, in collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Rajnath said: “Our private industry is coming of age when it comes to defence production. It is an important milestone not only in defence manufacturing but also in achieving Atmanirbhar Bharat as envisioned by our Prime Minister Narendra Modi.” A military veteran said later that in August last year the Centre had said it would stop importing items, including weaponry, in a phased manner to strengthen the country’s defence production. “India does not have enough indigenous capability to produce artillery guns, sonar systems, light combat helicopters and radars, but the government has been claiming to make India the world’s defence manufacturing hub,” he said. Artillery, guns, sonar systems and light combat helicopter radars are still at various stages of development by the DRDO. Another veteran said: “The defence minister should talk in detail on how India can be self-reliant in the defence sector without developing robust indigenous manufacturing capabilities.” A retired lieutenant general said if critical components continued to be imported and assembled in India, the country could not be called self-reliant in defence. “We need to first build indigenous capability and develop new technologies,” he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-279
25-08-2021||India||Biju Janata Dal rakes up issue of caste-based census in Odisha||The ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) on Tuesday raked up the issue of caste-based census in Odisha, putting the ball into the Centre’s court. With the BJD joining Nitish Kumar-led JDU in seeking caste-based census, the demand is getting louder. Some other allies of the NDA have also raised the issue of caste-based census in the country. However, political analysts think that the Centre is reluctant to do so as this could open a Pandora’s box, changing political equations and affecting the NDA’s support base. The BJD roped in two of its senior ministers Ranedra Pratap Swain and Arun Kumar Sahoo to raise the issue of caste-based census. Earlier on August 13, the party had announced to give 27 per cent reservations to people belonging to the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in panchayat elections scheduled to be held in February. Raising the issue of caste-based census, Swain said: “Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had earlier raised the issue. We must know the exact population of the backward classes so that steps can be taken up for their development. NDA allies have also raised the issue.” Targeting the Centre for its failure to take up a caste-based census, Swain said: “After the Centre rejected Odisha’s demand, the state cabinet meeting was held under the chairmanship of chief minister Naveen Patnaik on January 11, 2020, and the cabinet approved a proposal for caste-based census. Later the state government on February 12, 2020, had constituted the state commission for OBC.” The two ministers said: “Later, on February 17, 2020, the Naveen Patnaik government had passed a unanimous resolution to amend the Odisha State Commission for Backward Classes Act 1993 to enable the state government to make a survey of the social and educational condition of the people belong to the backward classes.” Both the ministers asserted that the number of OBC and the socially and economically backward classes is more than half of the population of Odisha and it is high time to remove the 50 per cent cap on reservation. Stating that it’s the job of the Centre to organise a caste-based census and move the Supreme Court for repeal of the provision of 50 per cent cap on reservation, the ministers said: “While political parties with allegiance to the BJP have raised their voice in support of repealing the 50 per cent cap on reservation, the silence of the BJP on the caste-based census shows its apathy towards OBCs.” However, the state BJP demanded that the Odisha government should fist implement 27 per cent reservation for OBCs in jobs. “The Odisha government is cheating the people. The Centre has implemented 27 per cent reservation for OBCs in jobs but state’s existing OBC quota is 11.25 per cent,” BJP’s OBC Morcha state president Surath Biswal said. Meanwhile, former union minister Srikant Jena in a letter to the chief minister urged him to take an all-party delegation to Delhi to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue. “The Odisha government should pass a resolution in the state Assembly for a caste-based census and to go above the 50 per cent stipulated reservation policy,” Jena said. At present people belonging to the SC and ST categories are availing 39 per cent reservations and the OBCs are getting 11.23 per cent reservation.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-280
25-08-2021||India||Mustard oil worth Rs 40 lakh looted from truck in Bihar||Mustard oil, with its prices skyrocketing, is the latest target of criminals in Bihar. They looted a truck loaded with mustard oil bottles, pouches and cans worth Rs 40 lakh from Muzaffarpur, around 75km from the state capital, and made good their escape, only to be nabbed by the police a day later on Tuesday. However, by that time they had sold around 500 cartons or 20 per cent of the total 2,500 cartons being transported in the truck. Efforts are on to trace out the people or traders who purchased them from the desperados. The mustard oil-laden truck was taking the consignment to Chhapra in Saran district. It halted at a place on National Highway 28 in Muzaffarpur and its driver Rajesh Kumar stepped down to visit his nearby residence for dinner and catch some sleep. His helper Mahendra Kumar slept in the vehicle. A group of six people came in a car. Some of them boarded the truck, held Mahendra captive and fled with the vehicle. When the helper resisted, he was badly beaten-up and thrown on the road. A police patrol car noticed Mahendra lying unconscious on the side of the road on Monday morning and took him to a nearby government hospital. He regained consciousness after some time and told the police about the incident. Muzaffarpur (town) deputy superintendent police (DSP) Ram Naresh Paswan told reporters that the police officials swung into action and discovered from footage from CCTV cameras installed in the area that the looted truck was being taken towards Vaishali district. They also contacted truck’s owner Rajesh Kumar. “We got some leads and guessed that the truck was being taken towards Patna. We issued an alert all around so that it could be apprehended. We also relayed a message about the truck’s registration number,” Paswan said. The truck was traced to Nawada on Tuesday. The police recovered it and arrested seven persons, including four accused of looting it and three traders. “Around 500 cartons of mustard oil are missing from the truck. The robbers had struck a deal to sell the remaining oil to traders in Jharkhand and were on the way with the vehicle. We are interrogating them further,” one of the police official said. Truck’s owner Manoj said that he had never heard about mustard oil being looted. “Mustard oil is a cooking essential in several states of the country and its retail price has jumped to around Rs 200 per litre these days. It seems the people involved in looting the truck were lured by the high price and demand of the commodity,” Manoj added. Retail price of mustard oil in Bihar has increased by around Rs 40 to 50 per litre over the last two months. Marijuana seized A joint team of excise and police officials apprehended a container truck in Barachatti in Gaya district of Bihar and seized 1,100kg of marijuana on Tuesday. One person has been arrested with the vehicle, while two of his accomplices managed to escape. The seizure was based on intelligence inputs and the contraband was being transported from Cuttack in Odisha to Haryana. It was hidden in a specially constructed secret chamber in the container. Excise officials said that the marijuana consignment would be worth between Rs 2 crore and Rs 3 crore in the market. Earlier, a truck carrying 700kg was seized at Rajapakar in Vaishali district of Bihar on Monday. The sacks of narcotic weed were hidden in a consignment of papayas.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-280
