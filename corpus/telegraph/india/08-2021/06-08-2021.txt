Searches were conducted at the offices of Novus Path Labs, DNA Labs, Max Corporate Services, Dr Lal Chandani Labs Pvt Ltd and Nalwa Laboratories Pvt Ltd and also at the residential premises of their directors in Dehradun, Haridwar, Delhi, Noida and Hisar, the agency said in a statement.  The ED said it has seized "incriminating documents, bogus bills, laptops, mobile phones and property documents and Rs 30.9 lakh cash" during the raids that were ongoing.  The agency recently registered a criminal case under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against the accused companies and their directors after studying Uttarakhand Police FIRs against them.  This was followed by the raids.  These labs were given the contract by the Uttarakhand government for conducting rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests for coronavirus during the Kumbh Mela, the ED said.  These labs hardly carried out any COVID-19 test and made "fake entries" for the testing and raised "bogus" bills in order to earn illegal financial gains, it said.  "An amount of Rs 3.4 crore has already been received by them from Uttarakhand government as part payment," the ED said.  The agency said its investigation found that the "modus operandi used by these labs was that they used single mobile number or a false mobile number, single address or same specimen referral form (SRF) for multiple persons for showing the inflated numbers of coronavirus testing without actually doing the testing".  "Testing was claimed to be done in the name of the persons who never visited the Kumbh mela in Haridwar," it claimed.  Due to false negative testing by these labs, positivity rate of Haridwar at that time was shown at 0.18 per cent against the actual 5.3 per cent, the ED said.  One of the world's largest religious gatherings, the Kumbh was held in the state from April 1 to 30, and the notified area for the congregation covered various places in Haridwar, Dehradun, and Tehri districts.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-347
06-08-2021||India||Hopeful of launching Covovax for adults in October this year, for children in Q1 2022: Serum CEO ||Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla on Friday said he is hopeful that Covovax, another COVID-19 vaccine being manufactured by his company in India, will be launched in October for adults and for children by the first quarter of 2022.  He also thanked the government for all the support provided to Serum Institute and said the company is always trying to expand its Covishield production capacity to meet the demand.  Poonawalla met Home Minister Amit Shah in Parliament and the meeting between the two lasted for 30 minutes.  "The government is helping us and we are facing no financial crunch. We are thankful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for all the cooperation and support," Poonawala told PTI after his meeting.  When asked about vaccines for kids, he said, "The Covovax vaccine for kids will be launched in the first quarter of the next year most likely in January-February."  Poonawala said he is hopeful that for adults Covovax will be launched in October, depending on DCGI approvals.  It will be a two-dose vaccine and the price will be decided at the time of launch, he added.  On production capacity of Covishield, the vaccine being manufactured and supplied by Serum in India under a licensing agreement with Oxford and AstraZeneca, he said the present capacity is 130 million doses per month and always try to increase it further.  Earlier in the day, Poonawalla also met Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya.  The minister tweeted that he had a productive discussion on the supply of the Covishield vaccine with Poonawalla.  "I appreciated their role in mitigating #COVID19 & assured continued Government support in ramping up vaccine production," Mandaviya said.  Last month, an expert panel of India's Central Drug Authority recommended granting permission to Serum Institute of India (SII) for conducting phase 2/3 trials of Covovax on children aged 2 to 17 years with certain conditions, official sources had earlier said.  The trials would cover 920 children, 460 each in the age group of 12-17 and 2-11 across 10 sites.  The Pune-based pharmaceutical company had submitted a revised protocol for inclusion of pediatric cohort in the ongoing Covovax phase 2 and 3 observer-blind, randomised, controlled study in Indian adults aged 18 years and above to determine the safety and immunogenicity of the jab.  In the revised application, SII director (government and regulatory affairs) Prakash Kumar Singh and director Dr Prasad Kulkarni had stated that globally, all adults aged 18 and above are being vaccinated and after this population is protected against COVID-l9, children will remain the most susceptible group.  Currently, only those who are 18 or above are eligible for vaccination against the coronavirus.  The SII is learnt to have informed that their collaborator, Novavax, Inc, US has already generated a large amount of data in adults in different countries and that the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity data on the Novavax COVID-I9 vaccine are very robust which includes a safety database of more than 50000 adults with data from Australia, South Africa, UK and USA and preliminary safety data in 2248 children.  "Further in the ongoing Phase 2/3 study in India, more than 1400 participants have received at least first dose of the vaccine with no safety concerns reported so far," the application stated.  "This will ensure that a life-saving vaccine can be brought at the earliest for our pediatric population also in addition to the adult population immediately after the grant of Emergency Use Authorisation.  The SEC on June 30 had recommended against granting permission to SII for conducting phase 2 and 3 trials of Covovax on children aged 2 to 17 years following which the company had submitted a revised study protocol last week.  In August 2020, US-based vaccine maker Novavax, Inc had announced a licence agreement with SII for the development and commercialisation of NVX-CoV2373, its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, in low and middle-income countries and India.

Speaking at a meeting with the industry for boosting Indian exports, Modi said exporters know the importance of policy stability. "The decision to abolish retrospective taxation shows government's commitment (to providing stable investment regime) and consistency of policy," he said. His government had on Thursday introduced in the Lok Sabha a bill to scrap retrospective taxation that has spooked overseas investors and dented the reputation of Asia's third-largest economy. India lost high-profile arbitrations initiated by companies such as Vodafone Group Plc and Cairn Energy Plc against levy of back taxes and risked its assets abroad being seized to enforce such tribunal awards. 'The Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021' was passed by the Lok Sabha on Friday and is expected to be taken up by the Rajya Sabha next week. "Exporters doing business in various countries know the importance of stability," Modi said, referring to the decision to abolish retrospective taxation. The bill provides for the withdrawal of tax demands made on "indirect transfer of Indian assets if the transaction was undertaken before May 28, 2012 (i.e. the day the retrospective tax legislation came into being)." "It is also proposed to refund the amount paid in these cases without any interest thereon," the bill said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-347

The summons served on Gulshan Nazir, who is in her late seventies, has asked her to appear before the ED's Srinagar office on August 18, they said. The Mehbooba Mufit-led PDP slammed the ED over the development, saying it was no coincidence that a summons is served every time the party registers a protest against the Centre's policy on Jammu and Kashmir. On Thursday, Mufti had led a team of protesters from her party to mark the second anniversary of the Centre's move to abrogate the special status of the erstwhile state on August 5, 2019. The PDP has asked the ED the details of the case including about the FIR and the accused "just so we can prepare legally and know what she is going to be asked about". She was summoned by the ED on earlier occasions also. The party had conveyed to the ED that she should be allowed human assistance as she was not well versed with English, Hindi and Urdu languages and if the details of the case were known, it would help her in being prepared for the questioning. The criminal case filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) is linked to the recovery of at least two diaries by the ED after raids on an alleged associate of Mufti. The diaries contain the details of some purported payments made from the chief minister's discretionary fund in alleged contravention of rules, officials said. These funds are alleged to have been diverted during the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) rule in the erstwhile state. A few lakh rupees from these funds are alleged to have been transferred into the accounts of Nazir and some others, and the Enforcement Directorate wants to question her about it, the officials said. Nazir is the wife of the late Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-347
06-08-2021||India||Govt always open to talks with protesting farmers, says Tomar||Amid farmers protest against three contentious farm laws at Jantar Mantar here, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday informed Parliament again the government is always open for discussion to resolve the issue. For over seven months now, thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi's borders in protest against the three laws that they say will end state procurement of crops at MSP. Out of them, a small group of 200 farmers are staging a protest against the farm laws at Jantar Mantar -- only a few hundred metres from the Parliament Complex -- in central Delhi after getting a special permission from Delhi government. "Government is always open to discussion with farmers unions and will remain open to discussion with agitating farmers to resolve the issue," Tomar said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha. Asserting that the government engaged itself actively and constantly with the agitating farmer unions to end the protests, the minister said that 11 rounds of negotiating talks were held between the government and agitating farmers to resolve the issues. "However, farmer unions never agreed to discuss the farm laws except for demanding their repeal," he said. In the last meeting on January 22, the government's negotiations with 41 farmer groups hit a roadblock as the unions squarely rejected the Centre's proposal of putting the laws on suspension. During the 10th round of talks held on January 20, the Centre had offered to suspend the laws for 1-1.5 years and form a joint committee to find solutions, in return for protesting farmers going back to their respective homes from Delhi's borders. The three laws -- The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- were passed by Parliament in September last year. Asked if consultations were held before introducing the bills, Tomar said various committees/task force were constituted recommending for several market reform measures to remove restrictive provisions impeding development of an efficient and competitive marketing system, for promotion of direct marketing, and for encouraging contract farming. They also recommended rationalisation of market fee/tax structure, deregulation of the marketing system to promote investment in market infrastructure, motivating corporate sector to undertake direct marketing and to facilitate a national integrated market, he said. Further, the minister said that during COVID-19 lockdown due to disruption of markets and supply chains, there was utmost need to allow free direct marketing outside the mandis to facilitate the farmers in selling their produce near to farm gate at remunerative prices. As COVID-19 situation may have a prolonged effect globally on demand side, hence the urgency for promulgation of Ordinances, to provide a new facilitative framework to promote barrier free inter-state and intra-state trade to increase market accessibility for farmers to enhance their income, he added. The minister also said that the draft of the Ordinances had been circulated to various Ministries/ Departments; NITI Aayog etc, for their comments. State governments were also consulted through video conferencing (VC) on May 21, 2020, which was attended by the officials of various states/ Union Territories (UTs), to obtain feedback on new legal framework facilitating barrier free inter-state and intra-state trade in agriculture produce to provide a choice to farmers, he added. "Government of India has proactively undertaken efforts on a series of extension activities through webinars, online conferences, workshops, teleconferencing, social media, print media, electronic media with the stakeholders on the aforesaid three Ordinances and thereafter on respective Acts," he said. Asked how the government will ensure payment of minimum support price (MSP) to farmers after implementation of the farm laws, Tomar said the MSP policy has nothing to do with Farm Acts. Farmers are free to sell their produce to government procurement agencies at MSP or Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) markets or through contract farming or in the open market whichever is advantageous to them, he said. The centre announces MSP for 22 major agricultural commodities of Fair Average Quality (FAQ) each year in both the crop seasons after taking into account the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). The government also extends remunerative prices to farmers through its various intervention schemes. The procurement at MSP is being done by central and state agencies under various schemes of the government. Besides, the overall market also responds to declaration of MSP and government's procurement operations, results in increase of selling price of the various notified crops, the minister added. The Supreme Court has put on hold the implementation of the three laws till further orders and set up a committee to find solutions. The committee has already submitted the report. Farmer groups have alleged that these laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporations, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-348

The court, however, said the affidavit filed by the microblogging platform in this regard is not on record and asked Twitter to ensure that it is brought on record. Justice Rekha Palli noted that the copies of the affidavit have been served to other parties, including the Centre's counsel who shall come back with instructions on August 10. Senior advocate Sajan Poovayya, representing Twitter, said the company has appointed permanent officials for the posts of CCO, RGO and Nodal Contact Person on August 4 in compliance of the new IT Rules and has also filed an affidavit in compliance of the court's earlier order. During the hearing, the court said, so they are in compliance now? To this Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, representing the Centre, said, Seemingly so but we need to verify. The high court had earlier expressed displeasure over Twitter Inc for appointing a contingent worker as CCO and had said the microblogging platform was non-compliant with the new IT Rules. It had noted that while the rules mandated appointment of a key managerial person or a senior employee as CCO, Twitter had disclosed in its affidavit that it had appointed a contingent worker through a third party contractor. It had directed Twitter to not only disclose all the details pertaining to the appointment of the CCO as well as the Resident Grievance Officer (RGO) but also clarify as to why a Nodal Contact Person had not been appointed yet and by when the position will be filled. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 seek to regulate dissemination and publication of content in cyber space, including social media platforms, and were notified in February by the central government. Petitioner-lawyer Amit Acharya, represented by senior advocate G Tushar Rao, has claimed that he came to know about the alleged non-compliance of IT Rules by Twitter when he tried to lodge a complaint against a couple of tweets. The court had earlier granted time to Twitter to file an affidavit to show compliance with the IT Rules. The Centre had said in its affidavit that Twitter failed to comply with India's new IT Rules, which could lead to its losing immunity conferred under the IT Act.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-348

Responding to a question on whether private laboratories are permitted to do genome sequencing of coronavirus, Minister of State for Health Bharati Pravin Pawar in a written reply said inclusion of private labs in Indian INSACOG (SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortium) is under consideration. "Few labs have submitted their willingness to be part of INSACOG. Their inclusion will be decided based on capacity assessment with respect to their human resources and infrastructure," she said in her reply. Analysis of the genomic data is a continuous and ongoing process. Periodic updates are shared with experts and states and are also regularly made available in the public domain through the media bulletin of INSACOG. States are regularly advised to send samples for genome sequencing and provide clinical data of positive persons to enable greater epidemiological insights to identify link between surge in cases at various places to the variants, the minister stated. Elaborating on the steps being taken to check the spread of the Delta variant, Pawar said to monitor the variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus, initially genomic sequencing was conducted through National Institute of Virology, Pune. Subsequently, the Centre established Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortium (INSACOG) in December 2020 as a consortium of 10 laboratories of Ministry of Health, Department of Biotechnology, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). The network of INSACOG laboratories has since been increased to 28, Pawar stated. While monitoring the prevalence of variants through the network of labs, according to advice from experts it is noted that the public health measures to manage the pandemic in the field and the treatment protocol remain the same and the five-fold strategy of test-track-treat-vaccinate and Covid-appropriate behavior is to be followed at the field level, she said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-348

Leaders of 14 Opposition parties met at Parliament House and then reached the nearby Jantar Mantar to participate in the Kisan Sansad, which began on July 22 to mark over seven months of the farmers' protests at Delhi's border points against the laws. The leaders neither spoke from the podium of the Kisan Sansad (farmers' parliament) nor were they seated on the dais. "Today all Opposition parties together decided to support the farmers and demand the withdrawal of the three farm laws," Gandhi told reporters. "We want to give our entire support to all the farmers of the country," he said. The three farm laws were enacted in September last year, following which farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at Delhi border points since November. "It will not work with a discussion on the farm laws and these black laws will have to be withdrawn," Gandhi said, when asked that the government says it is ready to hold talks with farmers. He also alleged that the government is not allowing the Opposition to raise the Pegasus snooping issue in Parliament. "You know what is happening in Parliament. We want to discuss the Pegasus (snooping) issue and they are not allowing it to happen. (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi has got into every telephone," he said. Gandhi, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge and several other Congress leaders besides members from other Opposition parties were present at the meeting at Parliament House. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, RJD leader Manoj Kumar Jha, CPI (M) leader Elamaram Kareem, CPI leader Binoy Viswam, IUML leader Mohammed Bashir and DMK leader Tiruchi Siva were among those present at Jantar Mantar. AAP and TMC leaders were not present at the Kisan Sansad site. "The Opposition leaders' meeting decided to hold their protest at Jantar Mantar at 1 pm and sit with the protesting farmers," a senior leader told PTI earlier. The leaders left Parliament at 12.30 pm in a bus to reach Jantar Mantar. Farmer groups have alleged these three agri laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced. They are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Leaders of several parties including the Congress, DMK, TMC, NCP, Shiv Sena, RJD, SP, CPI(M), AAP, CPI, IUML, RSP, NC and LJD attended the Opposition meeting in the morning.

This shall also cater to the regional aspirations for years to come, it said. According to the statement of objects, the bill seeks to amend the Central Universities Act, 2009, to provide for the establishment of a University named "Sindhu Central University" in Ladakh. The university will cater to all areas of Ladakh that include Leh and Kargil. The government had said the university is expected to reduce the imbalance in the region on the education sector and students of Ladakh to get quality higher education opportunities.

Dhyan Chand is widely regarded as the greatest player in hockey. In his career that spanned from 1926 to 1949, he clinched Olympic medals in 1928, 1932 and 1936. The country's National Sports Day is also celebrated to commemorate his birth anniversary on August 29. India's only athletics medal winner in World Championships, Anju Bobby George, who won the Khel Ratna in 2003, said sports awards should be named after sportspersons. "It is high time we name our sporting awards after our sporting legends. It is the right step. Dhyan Chand is our sporting hero and hockey legend and hockey is our national game. "It is only fitting that the country's highest sporting award is named after Dhyan Chand at a time when India won an Olympic medal after 41 years," she told PTI. Commending the decision, former hockey skipper Ajitpal Singh said although the recognition came late it's better than never. "It's a welcome move. It's a good decision which the Prime Minister has taken. Sports awards should always be in the name of sportspersons and there is no bigger sportsperson in the country other than Dhyanchand ji. The recognition came late but better late than never," Singh said. Olympic bronze-winning boxer Vijender Singh said while honouring the memory of Dhyan Chand is a good move but merely that is not enough to raise the standard of sports in the country. "Nothing against the move because we all respect Dhyan Chand ji's immense contribution but the government ought to do more than this to support sportspersons. They need facilities at the basic level, unless we can do that, mere renaming of awards won't make much of a difference," he told PTI. Making the announcement of the change on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he had been getting many requests from citizens across India to name the Khel Ratna Award after Major Dhyan Chand. "Major Dhyan Chand is India's most legendary & loved sporting icons; it is only befitting that India's Highest Sporting Honour be named after him. "His life and achievements have inspired generations of sportspersons who have achieved glory for India," Sports Minister Anurag Thakur tweeted after the announcement. The Khel Ratna was earlier named after former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. The change comes in the wake of exceptional performances by the men's and women's hockey teams in the ongoing Tokyo Olympics. While the men's side claimed a bronze medal which was India's 12th Olympic hockey medal that came after a gap of 41 long years, the women's side put forth its best-ever performance in the Games, finishing a creditable fourth.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-348
06-08-2021||India||Johnson & Johnson applies for Emergency Use Authorisation of vaccine in India||Global healthcare major Johnson & Johnson on Friday said it has applied for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of its single-dose Covid-19 vaccine in India. Earlier on Monday, the company had said that it remained committed to bringing its single-dose Covid-19 vaccine to India and looks forward to ongoing discussions with the Indian government. "On August 5, 2021 Johnson & Johnson Pvt Ltd applied for EUA of its single-dose Covid-19 vaccine to the government of India," a Johnson & Johnson India spokesperson said in a statement. This is an important milestone that paves the way for bringing the company's single-dose Covid-19 vaccine to the people of India, and the rest of the world, through a collaboration with Biological E Limited, the statement added. "Biological E will be an important part of our global supply chain network, helping to supply our Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine through the extensive collaborations and partnerships we have with governments, health authorities and organisations such as Gavi and the COVAX Facility," the statement said. The EUA submission is based on topline efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE clinical trial, which demonstrated that company's single-shot vaccine was 85 per cent effective in preventing severe disease across all regions studied, and showed protection against Covid-19 related hospitalisation and death, beginning 28 days after vaccination, it added. "We look forward to concluding our discussions with the government of India to accelerate availability of our Covid-19 vaccine to help end the pandemic," the statement said. India recorded 44,643 new coronavirus infections taking the total tally of Covid-19 cases to 3,18,56,757, while the active cases registered an increase for the third consecutive day, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Friday.

06-08-2021||India||CBI does not help when judges complain of threats, says Supreme Court||The Supreme Court Friday termed "serious" the incidents of judges being threatened and asked the states to file status reports on the security they are providing to the judicial officers. A bench comprising Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justice Surya Kant also issued notice to the CBI which has taken over the investigation into the recent incident of alleged mowing down of a judge at Dhanbad. The apex court was informed by the counsel appearing for Jharkhand that the probe into the July 28 incident has been handed over to the CBI. The bench told Attorney General K K Venugopal that there are several cases, which involve gangsters and high-profile persons and there are instances of judges getting threats or abusive messages. "There is no freedom to the judges to even file a complaint," the bench said, adding that police or the CBI is not helping the judiciary if such complaints are filed. "The CBI has not changed its attitude. When Judges complain to the CBI, Intelligence Bureau on threats, they do not respond. Investigating agencies do not help at all and I am making this statement with some sense of responsibility," CJI Ramana was quoted as saying by ndtv.com. "We will hear the Jharkhand matter on Monday (August 9). We are issuing notice to the CBI," the bench said. In wake of the Dhanbad incident, the top court has taken suo motu cognizance on the issue of safeguarding courts and protecting judges. A 20-member team has also been set by the CBI to probe the matter. It has left for Dhanbad, officials said, adding that it will be followed by a Central Forensic Science Laboratory team. District and Sessions Judge-8 of Dhanbad court, Uttam Anand, was out on a morning walk on Wednesday when he was killed by an auto-rickshaw at Randhir Verma Chowk near the district court in the Sadar police station area, stepping up investigations into his death that has led to a nationwide outrage among the legal fraternity which believes he was murdered. Judge Anand, a Hazaribagh native posted in Dhanbad six months ago, had been handling several cases of mafia killings in Dhanbad city. He had denied bail to Ravi Thakur and Anand Verma, suspected shooters who have been linked to alleged Uttar Pradesh gangsters Abhinav Singh and Aman Singh. Even though Jharkhand police had constituted an 11-member special investigation team (SIT) to probe the incident, chief minister Hemant Soren recommended a CBI probe on July 31, a day after the slain judge’s family members met him in Ranchi. The central probe agency had informed the Jharkhand High Court on Tuesday that it has received the state government's letter to take over the probe a day earlier. The bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad had directed the CBI to initiate a probe at the earliest. It had also directed the government to hand over all the documents of the case to the CBI.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-349

The history-making Indian women's hockey team, which had already surpassed all expectations by entering the semifinals of the Games for the first time, signed off with a fourth place finish after going down to Great Britain 3-4 in the bronze medal play-off. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the team can take pride from a campaign, in which it beat Australia 1-0 in the quarterfinals. "We will always remember the great performance of our Women's Hockey Team at #Tokyo2020. They gave their best throughout. Each and every member of the team is blessed with remarkable courage, skill and resilience. India is proud of this outstanding team. "We narrowly missed a medal in Women's Hockey but this team reflects the spirit of New India- where we give our best and scale new frontiers. More importantly, their success at #Tokyo2020 will motivate young daughters of India to take up Hockey and excel in it. Proud of this team," Modi tweeted. Sports Minister Anurag Thakur said he is proud of their effort. "India's daughters - our determined athletes; we are immensely proud of you!" he wrote. "A giant leap of faith & fighting spirit by our women's hockey team; a legacy that will inspire us to do even better! You have shown us the way," he said. Former sports minister Kiren Rijiju said hockey's golden era is back. "Don't break down girls, you all played superb at Tokyo2020 by reaching top 4 in the world!

Men's team skipper Manpreet Singh and former hockey player Viren Rasquinha said the women's side's journey at the Olympics was one of the best stories of the ongoing Games. They were there to cheer the team from the stands during the match. "The performance of the Indian women's hockey team has been one of the best stories of the Tokyo Olympics They played as a team and gave it their all. Cannot ask for any more.

06-08-2021||India||Narrowly missed medal but women's hockey team reflects spirit of new India, says PM||Hailing the Indian women's hockey team's performance at the Olympics, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said it narrowly missed a medal but it reflects the spirit of new India, "where we give our best and scale new frontiers". The history-making Indian women's hockey team's dream of securing its maiden Olympic medal remained unfulfilled as it lost 3-4 to Great Britain in a hard-fought bronze play-off match at the ongoing Games in Tokyo on Friday. "We narrowly missed a medal in Women's Hockey but this team reflects the spirit of New India -- where we give our best and scale new frontiers," Modi tweeted after the match. "More importantly, their success at #Tokyo2020 will motivate young daughters of India to take up Hockey and excel in it. Proud of this team," he said. Modi said people will always remember the great performance of our women's hockey team at the Tokyo Olympics. "They gave their best throughout. Each and every member of the team is blessed with remarkable courage, skill and resilience. India is proud of this outstanding team," the prime minister said. The team had already created history and surpassed all expectations by entering the semifinals of the Games for the first time. But the maiden Olympic medal remained out of bounds as world no. 4 Great Britain, who were gold-winners in the 2016 Rio Games, came out on top in the pulsating encounter. The heartbreak came a day after the Indian men's team ended a 41-year-old medal drought by clinching a bronze with a 5-4 win over Germany.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-349
06-08-2021||India||Pegasus truth has to come out, says CJI Ramana ||The Supreme Court on Thursday observed that the Pegasus snooping allegations, if true, were no doubt “serious” and the “truth has to come out”. Hearing a batch of petitions seeking a court-monitored probe into the Pegasus controversy, Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana said: “No doubt the allegations are serious, if the reports are true…. Truth has to come out, that’s a different story. We don’t know whose names are there.” The bench, which also had Justice Surya Kant, agreed to examine the Centre’s view on August 10. CJI Ramana said no order could be passed without hearing the government’s version on the allegations. The court directed the petitioners to serve copies of their petitions on the Union government so that the matter could be taken up for further hearing on Tuesday. The apex court said in a written order later: “Heard senior counsel appearing for the petitioners… at a considerable length. Let the matters be listed on Tuesday, the 10th August, 2021. In the meantime, learned Advocate­on­Record appearing for the petitioners are directed to serve copies of the Writ Petitions upon the Union of India well in advance.” During the 45-minute hearing, the court directed one of the petitioners, advocate Manoharlal Sharma, to remove the names of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah from his list of respondents. The other petitions don’t name the politicians as respondents. A collective of 17 media organisations has claimed to have found in an investigation that phones in many countries had been infected with the Israeli spyware Pegasus for the purpose of snooping. In India, the list of those allegedly snooped on or selected as targets includes judges, senior politicians, journalists and rights activists. The Modi government has stonewalled Opposition demands for discussions in Parliament on Pegasus and dismissed it as a “non-issue”. The Centre has not even clarified whether it had purchased the Pegasus spyware. On Thursday, the Supreme Court initially felt that except for the petition filed by the Editors Guild of India, the others were not based on adequate research. CJI Ramana wondered why no FIRs had been registered by the aggrieved persons and recalled that the allegations of intrusion had first surfaced in 2019. “The surveillance issue came to light two years ago, why come now suddenly?” the CJI asked. “If you know your phone is hacked, why not file a criminal complaint?” “We are not saying the petitions are based on hearsay and we cannot say there is no material, but with your access to international material, resources, the petitioners, some of them who are reputed persons and intellectuals, should have made more efforts,” Justice Ramana told senior advocate Kapil Sibal. Sibal was appearing for veteran journalists N. Ram and Shashi Kumar. Sibal said fresh evidence had emerged late on Wednesday that suggested that an old phone of a former Supreme Court judge and two ex-registrars of the top court had been on the list of potential Pegasus targets. The Wire news portal reported on Wednesday that an old phone number of former Supreme Court judge Arun Mishra and the numbers of two officers of the Supreme Court registry were on the list that featured potential targets for surveillance. Terming Pegasus a “rogue technology”, Sibal said that with the help of the spyware the government could intrude into the private lives of people. “If I move around in my private moments, they can watch me. They can activate my camera, my mic…. Pegasus is a rogue technology that enters our lives without our knowledge. It is an assault on privacy, dignity and the value of our republic,” the senior counsel said. Sibal added: “The government has to answer who purchased it? How much was spent? Where was the hardware placed? Why did the government not register the FIR? It’s a matter of our privacy. It is only the government that will be able to tell us facts.” Senior advocate C.U. Singh, appearing for some of the petitioners, said the names of the individuals allegedly under surveillance were not known in 2019, when too there had been a flurry over snooping using Pegasus. He said the identities of the people had emerged now after forensic analysis, prompting the petitioners to approach the Supreme Court. Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora, representing CPM Rajya Sabha member John Brittas, said then law and information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had in 2019 told Parliament that to the best of his knowledge there had been no such surveillance. Since sufficient materials have surfaced now, it was necessary for the court to order a probe into the fresh allegations, Arora said. Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for academic Jagdeep Chhokkar whose phone was allegedly hacked with the help of Pegasus, said the US and French governments had ordered investigations into the allegations. Assailing the surveillance, he said it amounted to a “war by the government on the citizens”. Arvind Datar, senior advocate representing journalist Rupesh Kumar Singh, quoted Section 43 of the IT Act to point out that it only provides for filing a suit for damages. There is no provision in criminal law for prosecution of officials responsible for hacking, Datar told the court. He said that as of now the names of 300 people whose phones had been “hacked” had surfaced “God knows how many more names are there,” Datar said. As soon as the hearing began, CJI Ramana told Sharma, the petitioner: “Mr Sharma, except newspaper cuttings, what is there in your petition?” The court, however, clarified that it was not disbelieving news reports but said the petitioners must be able to collect independent materials to substantiate the allegations of illegal surveillance. “You have added individual persons as respondents. We can’t issue notice, we know why you have named them. We are not here for your entertainment,” Justice Ramana told Sharma. Justice Surya Kant pointed out that Sharma had not made the Centre a respondent and instead chosen to array the Prime Minister and the home minister. The judge pointed out that Sharma had submitted a complaint to the CBI on June 21 seeking an investigation into the allegations of snooping, but on the very next day he filed a PIL in the Supreme Court. Justice Surya Kant said the petitioner should have given a few days to the CBI to act on his complaint instead of rushing to the court. Sharma offered to amend the memo of parties. Later the court said in the written order: “…The Court is convened through Video Conferencing. Permission to appear and argue in person is allowed in Writ Petition (Civil) (M.L. Sharma). “As prayed, he is permitted to amend the Memo of Party.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-349
06-08-2021||India||Modi links India's hockey bronze to Article 370 dilution & Ram Mandir construction||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday linked India’s feat of winning an Olympic hockey bronze to the dilution of Article 370 and the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya on the ground that they shared the “special” date of August 5. Elsewhere, in a display of how sporting success can bring a country together, hockey Olympians from Zafar Iqbal and Gurbux Singh to Joaquim Carvalho and Dhanraj Pillay lauded Manpreet Singh’s team for ending India’s 41-year hockey medal drought. “Aisa lag raha hai Bharat ki vijay ki shuruwat ho chuki hai. Isme 5 August ki taarikh bahut vishesh ban gayi hai, bahut mahatwapurn ban gai hai. Itihas isko saalon tak darz karega (It seems the process of India’s triumph has begun. In this, August 5 has become very special, very important. This date will be lodged in history for years),” Modi told an event in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh virtually from Delhi. “Yeh 5 August hi hai jab do saal pahle desh ne Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat ke sapne ko aur sashakt kiya tha. Karib saat dasak baad Article 370 hatakar Jammu-Kashmir ke har nagarik ko har adhikar har suvidha ka pura bhagidar banaya tha (It was on August 5 two years ago that the country had strengthened the dream of One India, Best India. The removal of Article 370 after nearly seven decades gave every citizen of Jammu and Kashmir full partnership in every right and every benefit).” Modi added: “Yehi 5 August hai jab pichhle saal koti koti bharatiyon ne saikdon saal baad bhavya Ram mandir ke nirman ki taraf pahla kadam rakha. Aaj teji se Ayodhya mein Ram mandir ke nirman ka karya chal raha hai (It was on August 5 last year that crores of Indians had, after centuries, taken the first step towards the construction of a grand Ram temple. Today, construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya is on in full swing).” He went on: “Aur 5 August ki tarikh phir ek baar hum sabhi ke liye utsah aur umang leke aayi hai. Aaj hi Olympic ke maidan par desh ke yuvaon ne hockey ke apne gaurav ko phir se sabit karne ke taraf badi chhalang lagai hai. Char dashak ke baad ye swarnim pal aayi hai (August 5 has once again brought us excitement and enthusiasm. Today, at the Olympics, the country’s youth have taken a giant leap towards reinstating India’s pride in hockey. This golden moment has come after four decades).” While scrapping Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on August 5, 2019, the Modi government had enforced a lockdown and information blockade on the ground, suspending phone and Internet services and arresting hundreds of politicians and activists. On August 5, 2020, as the country reeled under a pandemic, Modi had led the “bhoomi pujan” (groundbreaking ceremony) for the Ram temple in Ayodhya. The revocation of Article 370 and the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya had been part of the BJP’s core agenda since its birth, but during Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s time it had been forced to exclude these from its political programme to gain allies. But with the BJP gaining absolute majority in 2014 under Modi, the party has revived these agendas. A bigger majority in 2019 encouraged it to implement them, making brazen use of state power. Modi might not know it but August 5 is a memorable date in Olympic history for reasons that go beyond sport. It was on this day in 1936 that the African American athlete Jesse Owens won the 200m sprint to complete the 100m, 200m and long jump treble in the Berlin Olympics, shattering Adolf Hitler’s hopes of turning the Games into an advertisement of Aryan superiority. On Thursday, Modi slammed the Opposition parties for stalling Parliament, saying they were “blocking national interest” at a time the country was surging ahead after overcoming the Covid pandemic. “Our country, our youth are accomplishing so much, scoring winning goals — yet there are some who for their political motives are intent on scoring own goals,” he said. “At a time when every Indian is trying to battle the once-in-a-century pandemic, they (the Opposition) are bent on blocking national interest.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-349
06-08-2021||India||Opposition accuses govt of playing TV trick to black out protest inside the House||The Opposition on Thursday accused the ruling dispensation of “playing a trick” on them to black out visuals of their protest inside the House on Lok Sabha TV while giving the impression to them that it was being aired. For the first time during the ongoing monsoon session on Thursday, two big screens installed inside the Lok Sabha showed visuals of Opposition members waving placards and raising slogans in the well of the House. The Opposition’s happiness, however, was short-lived when they found out that the protest visuals were being shown on the internal screens but not aired on Lok Sabha TV for public viewing. “Our placards and slogans were being shown on the screens inside the House. Later we found out that the visuals were not shown outside so that people could see it on Lok Sabha TV,” Congress MP Suresh Kodikunnil told The Telegraph. “After the House was adjourned, Opposition members complained to the Speaker and he assured us that portions of our protest would be shown,” Suresh added. Some long shots of Opposition members standing in the well of the House were shown later. The Opposition, however, wants their protest and the issues they are raising to be given ample coverage on Lok Sabha TV so that people know why Parliament is being stalled. “Not only are they (the government) not allowing us to raise the issues by admitting adjournment motions that are being given repeatedly, but Lok Sabha TV is also being used for political purposes only to show the ruling party and not what the Opposition is protesting over,” Akali Dal MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal said. The Lok Sabha secretariat does not show close-ups of protests on the ground that unruly scenes denigrate the dignity of Parliament. On Lok Sabha TV, viewers can hear the protests, though not clearly, but can’t see close-up visuals. Lok Sabha TV has the sole right of broadcasting uninterrupted House proceedings.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-349
06-08-2021||India||Tokyo Olympics: Efforts of Naveen govt to support hockey bear fruit ||Efforts by the Naveen Patnaik government in Odisha to support hockey bore fruit on Thursday when the Indian men’s team bagged bronze at the Tokyo Olympics. The Odisha government is the official sponsor of the Indian hockey teams (both men and women) since 2018. It is contracted to sponsor the teams till 2023 in a deal worth over Rs 100 crore. Congratulating the players, Naveen, who himself played hockey in his schooldays as a goalkeeper, said: “Many congratulations to our hockey team. The whole of India is so excited, as is Odisha of course. We are all behind you and wish you the very best. We are looking forward to receiving our Indian Olympic hockey team in Bhubaneswar on the 16th of this month. All the very best for all of you for the future. All the best.” Naveen also tweeted: “Brilliant in Blue. Congratulations Indian Men’s Hockey team on the spectacular victory to give us an Olympic medal after 41 long years. This historic win at Tokyo 2020 will inspire generation of sportspersons. All the very best for the future.” Showering praise on Naveen for his support, men’s team captain Manpreet Singh said: “It’s a special moment for all of us. We finally achieved our dream of winning an Olympic medal. On this special occasion, I would like to express our special thanks to the Hon’ble chief minister of Odisha, Naveen Patnaikji, who has supported us throughout this journey. “His vision for hockey and encouragement has helped us achieve this remarkable feat for the country. While everyone was supporting cricket, the Hon’ble CM chose hockey and today you can see the result of the vision. I would like to say thank you so much, Sir.” The chief minister spoke to the family members of two Odisha players — Birendra Lakra and Amit Rohidas — who are part of the team. Official sources said the Odisha government was planning to organise a grand welcome for the Indian contingent when it arrives in Bhubaneswar on August 16. “When no one came forward to sponsor hockey, chief minister Naveen Patnaik took the responsibility upon himself. Today is a proud moment for India. When we talk about Chak De! India, the leadership and vision of Naveen Patnaik is reflected through hockey,” said BJD spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Sasmit Patra. In 2018, then official sponsor Sahara had backed out, putting the future of Indian hockey in jeopardy. Odisha sports minister Tusharkanti Behera said on Thursday: “To promote hockey, we worked on a two-fold strategy — to build infrastructure and to groom and encourage talent. When other states had declined to host the (men’s) hockey World Cup, Odisha came forward to organise it. Kalinga Stadium was refurbished in record time. A second astroturf was also laid in no time….” Sources said nearly Rs 450 crore was spent. “Money has never been a constraint in promoting sports. We are now building a world-class hockey stadium at Rourkela for the upcoming Men’s Hockey World Cup. For 2020-21, we have earmarked over Rs 300 crore for building sports infrastructure. Besides, we are channelling money from the district mineral fund to build the infrastructure,” the minister said. The new stadium at Rourkela, which is being built at a cost of around Rs 100 crore, will have a capacity to hold 20,000 spectators. “Now we are laying astroturfs in 17 blocks in Sundergarh, considered the home of hockey in Odisha,” said Behera. To give the best possible grooming to players, the Odisha government, along with Tata Steel and Tata Trusts, set up the Naval Tata Hockey Academy on the premises of Kalinga Stadium in 2019. “The Odisha Naval Tata Hockey High Performance Centre here is currently grooming 61 players and the number will reach 80 by September. We have brought in raw talent from the rural belt through various programmes and worked with them to ensure that they reach the next level. With training on astroturf, we are now on a par with western players in terms of speed and resilience,” Rajiv Seth, project director of the centre, said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-349

06-08-2021||India||Pegasus: Modi govt will crumble the moment India’s youth understands the truth, says Rahul Gandhi||Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said the Narendra Modi government would crumble the moment India’s youth understood the truth and Pegasus was a weapon to ensure that didn’t happen easily. Arguing that the purpose of surveillance was to suppress the truth, the Congress leader said: “The day India’s youth understands the truth, starts raising this truth, the Narendra Modi government will fall apart. Pegasus is a weapon to suppress the truth. They haven’t put it only in my phone. Every youth is targeted. It is a conspiracy to ensure the truth doesn’t come out. If you speak the truth, Modi is in your phone through Pegasus.” Rahul was speaking at a Youth Congress rally that had been organised as part of “Parliament gherao” to protest the alleged snooping, farm laws, unemployment and the economic mess. A police crackdown had started from Wednesday evening itself. Buses were stopped from entering the national capital and Youth Congress workers were evicted from hotels. Despite massive mobilisation, the protesters were prevented from moving towards Parliament. Mild force and water cannons were used to disperse the marching crowds. Many senior Congress leaders addressed the rally, which is being seen as the biggest post-Covid protest against the government in the capital. Rahul said: “The whole focus of the Modi government is to hide the truth. In Parliament, Opposition leaders are protesting with placards, but that will not be shown on TV. Only BJP MPs speaking is shown on Lok Sabha TV. People won’t be shown the truth. Mediapersons are here. Ask them whether they have the freedom to show the truth. Do they talk about unemployment?” Referring to the distress all around, he said: “Farmers are suppressed, youth is suppressed, small businesses are suppressed. It is a ‘hum do-hamare do’ government. This is the reason India is unable to create jobs. And there won’t be jobs as long as Modi is there because his partnership is with two-three corporate houses. His partnership is not with the youth, farmers, the poor, small and medium businesses, workers.” The former Congress president added: “Unemployment is the biggest issue today. But the Prime Minister will talk about every issue except unemployment. He promised 2 crore jobs every year, but millions of existing jobs are being snatched every month. This happens because Modi works for only two-three corporate houses.” Rahul asked the Youth Congress to open its doors to the disgruntled youth who are not getting jobs and promised to stand with them in their fight for employment. Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, later told the media: “We want a discussion (on Pegasus) in Parliament, but the government is running away. They don’t allow us to speak on farmers, on snooping and pass 10 bills in one hour. Is this democracy?”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-350
06-08-2021||India||Covid: Bombay High Court moots travel pass for the fully vaccinated||Bombay High Court on Thursday asked the Maharashtra government to consider identifying and segregating those who have taken both doses of Covid-19 vaccine from the rest, and provide a “common card” to fully inoculated people to allow them unrestricted travel and work. The court said the state government should consider allowing people who have received both doses to travel in local trains and resume normal activities. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni also said the state and the Centre must consider issuing a “common card” that identifies a citizen as fully vaccinated and permits him or her to travel and work unrestrained. Advocate-general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, who appeared for the Maharashtra government, told the court that a letter from the state disaster management authority would be issued for lawyers and registered judicial clerks, based on which the railways would give them travel passes. The bench referred to an interview with Maharashtra Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi, published in a newspaper on Thursday. Dr Joshi said one-third of Maharashtra’s population was still susceptible to the coronavirus, and unrestricted local train travel could not be permitted yet as identifying the fully vaccinated was cumbersome. “If Dr Joshi says it (train travel) can be done subject to identification, it is for the state and the Centre to identify the fully vaccinated (people),” the court said. “One-third of the population is still susceptible to the virus. Then, this one-third population should be separated from the two-third or from the fully vaccinated. At least provide them with a card identifying them as fully vaccinated.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-350

Girikumar Thekkan Kunnumpurath, 50, from Kannur who works as a welder in Dammam, has urged Kerala High Court to direct the central government to either vaccinate him again with Covishield, which is recognised in Saudi Arabia, or get Covaxin validated in other countries. He could face job loss if he did not reach Saudi Arabia by the end of August, Girikumar said. Girikumar’s counsel Manas P. Hameed said the court had served notice to the Union health ministry seeking its opinion on the matter. “The notice was served on the Union ministry since the Kerala government doesn’t have any role in formulating vaccination policy,” Hameed told The Telegraph. The lawyer said the case would be heard on Monday when the Centre’s version would be considered. As of now, there is no provision to opt for another immunisation cycle with a different vaccine after being inoculated with two doses. Girikumar has to reach Saudi Arabia by August 30 when his re-entry permit is set to expire. “I had no idea a vaccine would land me in trouble. But soon after my second shot (on May 17), I came across news reports that Covaxin is not among the vaccines recognised by Saudi Arabia and many other countries,” he told this newspaper on Thursday. “I came home on leave in January. But then the situation worsened in India and all flights were stopped to Saudi Arabia and other countries. I waited in anticipation that the crisis would be resolved, only to land in this mess,” Girikumar said. In his petition, Girikumar has mentioned that he would not also be able to travel to Saudi Arabia via a third country as those nations that can be used as pit stops by Indian expats don’t recognise Covaxin. Non-tourists from India are not allowed to fly directly to Saudi Arabia because of the Covid restrictions. They can travel via countries such as the Maldives, Qatar and the UAE, provided they are fully inoculated with a recognised vaccine. Girikumar’s employer had earlier helped him by extending his re-entry permit for a second time since he got stranded. “My re-entry permit was last extended on July 30 and I was granted 30 days to return. I could lose my job if I don’t return by then,” said the father of two daughters. Girikumar said the Kannur district medical officer had pleaded helplessness when he had asked for Covishield shots. “The government should either allow me to take Covishield or get Covaxin recognised everywhere,” Girikumar said. Although the two Covishield doses are administered at least 84 days apart, the government has allowed that gap to be reduced to 28 days for students travelling abroad and expats. India has till now administered close to 60 million doses of Covaxin. The third and final-stage trial results of the vaccine have been made public but are yet to be peer-reviewed. Bharat Biotech has said Covaxin has so far received emergency use authorisation approvals in 16 countries.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-350
06-08-2021||India||State govt will impose complete lockdown if people fail to observe Covid guidelines: Naveen Patnaik||Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Wednesday warned that the government would be forced to impose a complete lockdown in the state if people fail to observe Covid-19 guidelines properly as this is bound to result in a spike in Covid cases. The chief minister issued the warning while addressing the people of the state and cautioning them against the possible third wave of the pandemic. Coinciding with Naveen’s address, the chief administrator of the Puri Shree Jagannath Temple announced the decision to re-open the famous shrine from August 16. The chief minister said that scientists have already warned about a third wave of the pandemic and the situation in some of the countries has taken a serious turn. “At this point, there is an urgent need to adhere to Covid guidelines,” said Naveen. Stating that his government’s focus was on both life and livelihood, Naveen said the state has begun the unlocking process but this does not mean that people should become careless as the threat of a third wave still persists. The state has allowed shops to remain open from 6am-8pm so that livelihood is not affected. However, weekend shutdown continues in three cities — Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Puri — owing to the high corona caseload. The state during the last 24 hours reported another 1,315 corona positive cases and 66 deaths. So far the state has recorded 6,168 deaths. While the chief minister was cautioning people and advising them to wear masks and follow social distancing norms, the announcement about the re-opening of the Shree Jagannath Temple was made as part of the unlock process. Making the announcement the chief administrator of the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA), Dr Krishan Kumar said: “The temple will be open for devotees from August 16. However, only the people of Puri town will be allowed to have ‘darshan’ of the deities for the first five days. As there is a weekend shutdown on August 21 and August 22 (Saturday and Sunday) devotees from other parts of the state will be allowed entry into the shrine from August 23.” However, devotees entering the shrine will have to produce either their final Covid vaccination certificate or the RTPCR negative report. All the Covid guidelines will be followed inside the shrine and devotees will have to stand in a queue and wait for their turn to enter the temple. The administration has decided to launch a door-to-door campaign in Puri to ensure that all the servitors, officials of the temple administration have already taken the second dose of vaccines.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-350
