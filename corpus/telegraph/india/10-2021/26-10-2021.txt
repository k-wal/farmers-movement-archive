The panel headed by Haryana Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Rajeev Arora held talks with representatives of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, which is spearheading the stir, in Jhajjar's Bahadurgarh, close to the Tikri border.  Arora was accompanied by DGP P K Agrawal and other officials.  The meeting has come days after the Supreme Court said farmers protesting at Delhi borders cannot block roads indefinitely.  Arora told reporters that the main purpose of the meeting was how to open the road for smooth movement of traffic.  Replying to a question, Arora said before talking to the Delhi Police they wanted to know if all roads on the Haryana side are open.  Though the apex leadership of the SKM was not present in the meeting, it was held with representatives of the Morcha in a cordial atmosphere, he said.  A farmer leader said they conveyed in the meeting that from their side, no road has been blocked.  "The entire responsibility to open roads is on the Delhi Police as the way has been blocked towards the other side," he claimed.  "We told the Haryana government committee that we have not blocked roads," he added.  Representatives of the industry too were present in the meeting.  Speaking to reporters, an industry representative said, "The officials listened to our concerns patiently. We told them that industry is facing lot of problems due to road blockade and some have been forced to shift to other places.  The Haryana government had last month constituted the committee to hold talks with the protesting farmers for clearing the blockade at the Tikri and Kundli-Singhu borders, where farmers have been protesting against the farm laws for past 11 months.  Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij had last month said the committee had been constituted to comply with the apex court orders to open passage on the national highways leading to the national capital.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-86

26-10-2021||India||He can get me shot...: Nitish Kumar laughs off Lalu's poll dare||Laughing off arch-rival Lalu Prasad’s challenge for the October 30 bypolls in Bihar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has said the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) patriarch can get him “shot”, but “can’t do anything else”. In a video shared by news agency ANI, Kumar is seen speaking to reporters. Asked about Lalu Yadav's remark that he has returned to Patna to ensure the “visarjan” -- immersion -- of Kumar and the ruling NDA in the bypolls, the Chief Minister started laughing. “If he wants, he can get me shot, he cannot do anything else,” he said. In an interview to ANI on Monday, Lalu Prasad said he will campaign for his party at poll-bound Kusheshwar Asthan (SC) and Tarapur Assembly segments. “I know Tejashwi is campaigning in both the places and is doing really well in giving a strong fight to the NDA. I will ensure visarjan (immersion),” he said. The return of Lalu Prasad to the Bihar political arena after a gap of three years has raised political temperatures ahead of the bypolls. The RJD founder, who was in prison till earlier this year following his conviction in fodder scam cases, hit headlines soon after his return. Responding to a question on the rift between the RJD and Congress, Lalu Yadav told reporters, “What is Congress's alliance? Why should we give the seat to Congress? So that they would lose? So they would lose their deposit?” His remark on the Congress's Bihar unit in-charge Bhakt Charan Das drew criticism, with the party accusing the RJD leader of hurting the self-respect of the Dalit community. Das had said the alliance between the two parties would have remained intact had the RJD spared one seat for the Congress in the bypolls. Lalu Yadav's remarks also come against the backdrop of the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections when the RJD, despite emerging as the single largest party, had to sit in the Opposition benches as ally Congress won only 19 out of the 70 seats it contested.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-86
26-10-2021||India||Sameer is not attached to any party, says wife||The wife of under-fire NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede on Tuesday came out in strong support of her husband and said they were getting threat calls, facing vicious trolling online and living in fear as she rejected allegations levelled against him by Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik. Talking to the media in suburban Andheri, Kranti Redkar, who is an actress, described her husband as an honest government officer and also refuted the extortion attempt claims made by an NCB witness in the Mumbai cruise drugs case which is being supervised by Wankhede. Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan is among 20 persons arrested in connection with the case, which relates to alleged seizure of drugs from a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast early this month. Redkar claimed a section is working against her husband. "My husband is an honest officer and doing his duty with sincerity for the last 15 years. Sameer is not attached to any political party, he is a central government employee and doing his work, some people are having a problem from his work due to which everything (row related to allegations against Wankhede) is happening," she said. "People who are against Sameer have been threatening us, saying they will burn us and kill our family, but the police have given us security, and they are taking very good care of us," Redkar said. Asked about the series of allegations made against Wankhede by Malik, she said the state minister has made his claims on social media and not in front of a court of law. "Minister Nawab Malik has put allegations against us on Twitter, and Twitter is not a court. If Malik submits allegations against Sameer in a court and if all allegations are proved, then only the person becomes a criminal. Media trials can not help him," Redkar said. Malik on Monday claimed Wankhede is a Muslim by birth and was hiding his religious identify. Asked about Malik's claims, Redkar said they were untrue. "Sameer and me are born Hindus. We have never converted to any other religion. We respect all religions. Sameer's father, too, is a Hindu who married a Muslim woman...my mom-in-law is no more," she said. Asked about NCB witness Prabhakar Sail's claim that there was an extortion bid of Rs 25 crore by some agency officials, including Wankhede, and others for letting off Aryan Khan in the drugs case, Redkar said if he has evidence, he should produce it in a court. Earlier in the day, Malik launched a fresh attack on Wankhede and accused him of illegal phone tapping and said he will hand over a letter listing the IRS officer's misdeeds' to the NCB head. Sameer Wankhede through two persons in Mumbai and Thane is illegally intercepting the mobile phones of some people, said Malik, who has been targeting Wankhede after his son-in-law's arrest in a separate drugs case. The state minister also claimed that Wankhede had sought the call detail record (CDR) of a member of his family from the police. Wankhede, in an affidavit submitted to a Mumbai court on Monday, claimed he was under a "lurking threat of arrest as it does not suit some vested interests for conducting an honest and impartial investigation". In the past, Malik has made a series of allegations against Wankhede, ranging from forging documents, lying about his religion to dubbing some of the cases investigated under his supervision as fake. The 2008-batch IRS officer has refuted all allegations made by Malik.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-86
26-10-2021||India||Opposition demand sacking of Goa CM's post Malik's allegations||Opposition parties on Wednesday demanded that Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant should be sacked after former governor Satya Pal Malik accused the state government of corruption. While the ruling BJP in the state dismissed the allegations as baseless following Malik's TV interview on Tuesday night, leaders of the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) and Goa Forward Party targeted Sawant. There was corruption in everything the Goa government did (during the COVID-19 pandemic). I was removed for my allegation of corruption against the Goa government, Malik, now the governor of Meghalaya, alleged. He also termed the Goa government's initiative to distribute ration at people's doorsteps as "impractical", alleging that it was launched on the "insistence of a company that paid money to the government." While chief minister Sawant has not commented on the allegations yet, an AITC delegation led by Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy and including former Union Minister Babul Supriyo and the party's vice president Luizinho Faleiro met current Governor P S Sridharan Pillai on Wednesday. You must immediately seek resignation from the chief minister and announce investigation by an independent agency, the AITC's memorandum to the governor said. It also demanded a white paper on the government purchases and expenditures during the pandemic. Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said Malik's interview endorsed the corruption allegations leveled by the Congress, and demanded dismissal of the Sawant-led cabinet. He also demanded a time-bound investigation under the supervision of a sitting Supreme Court judge into the alleged corruption. The ED, CBI, Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) and other agencies should be directed to file cases against Sawant and others, Vallabh said, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should explain why no action was taken even after "the governor (Malik) informed him about the rampant corruption." AAP leader Raghav Chaddha, speaking at a press conference in Delhi, demanded that Sawant resign immediately and sought an independent judicial probe. The AAP also held a protest march in Panaji, led by its state convener Rahul Mahambrey. A delegation of the Goa Forward Party, led by Vijai Sardesai, also met the governor demanding the sacking of the chief minister. Independent MLA Rohan Khaunte said the CM should be sacked and President's rule be imposed in the state. After Malik's interview aired, Goa BJP chief Sadanand Shet Tanavade had said that the allegations were false and baseless, and they would be complaining to the Union government against him.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-86
26-10-2021||India||No bail for Aryan today as hearing to continue tomorrow||The jail-stay for Aryan Khan got an extension for another day, as the Bombay High Court posted his bail hearing for tomorrow. According to an NDTV report, in today’s arguments, former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi representing Shah Rukh Khan’s eldest son argued that Aryan was a “young man” and should be sent to a rehab rather than jail. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Tuesday had opposed the bail plea filed by actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan, who was arrested earlier this month in the cruise drugs seizure case, alleging the 23-year-old was not just a consumer of drugs but also involved in illicit drug trafficking. The agency also claimed that Aryan Khan and a woman named Pooja Dadlani, Shah Rukh Khan's manager, were tampering with the evidence and witnesses in the case in an attempt to derail the investigation. Earlier, Aryan Khan (23) had moved the HC on October 20 after a special NDPS court in Mumbai rejected his bail plea in the afternoon. The special court, while refusing bail, had observed that Aryan Khan was involved in "illicit drug activities on a regular basis" and had a nexus with drug peddlers and suppliers. The lower court had also rejected the bail pleas of Aryan Khan's friend Arbaaz Merchant and fashion model Munmun Dhamecha. The three were arrested on October 3 by the NCB after it raided the Goa-bound ship and claimed to have seized drugs, including charas. They are now in judicial custody. While Aryan Khan and Merchant are lodged at the Arthur Road prison, Dhamecha is lodged at the Byculla women's prison in the city. The trio and others were held in the case for alleged conspiracy, possession, consumption, purchase and trafficking of drugs under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. So far, 20 people have been arrested in the case.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-87
26-10-2021||India||NCB Mumbai director Sameer Wankhede visits Delhi headquarters||Sameer Wankhede, the Narcotics Control Bureau's Mumbai zonal director who is leading the probe in the cruise drugs case in which actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan is arrested, visited the agency's headquarters here on Tuesday and spent over two hours. The officer entered the NCB office in the R K Puram area through a back entry gate and is understood to have met his senior officers. It was not confirmed if Wankhede met NCB director general (DG) S N Pradhan. However, sources indicated that the top brass of the federal anti-narcotics agency met on Tuesday for a review meeting of various zonal offices of the agency in the country. NCB deputy director general (DDG) northern region Gyaneshwar Singh, heading the departmental vigilance probe on the allegations of extortion in the drugs-on-cruise case, told reporters outside the NCB office that he "did not call anyone for my probe". "When it is required, I will call him (Wankhede)," Singh, an IPS officer, said. He added that he was not travelling to Mumbai on Tuesday. Wankhede's visit to the national capital comes in the backdrop of the NCB ordering a vigilance inquiry into the allegations made by a witness in the cruise drugs case of an extortion bid of Rs 25 crore by some agency officials, including the Mumbai zonal director, and others for letting off Aryan Khan. The officer had told media persons outside the IGI Airport on Monday that he has not been summoned by the agency but has some work here adding he did a fair job in the drugs-on-cruise case. Wankhede on Sunday had written to Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale, seeking protection from likely legal action "being planned" against him by unknown persons to falsely frame him concerning an alleged vigilance-related issue. On Monday, he failed to get any relief related to an affidavit on the sensational extortion claims made by the independent witness, Prabhakar Sail, with a special court saying it cannot pass a blanket order barring courts from taking cognisance of the document.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-87
26-10-2021||India||Aryan Khan not just drug consumer but also involved in drug trafficking, alleges NCB||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Tuesday opposed the bail plea filed by actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan, who was arrested earlier this month in the cruise drugs seizure case, alleging the 23-year-old was not just a consumer of drugs but also involved in illicit drug trafficking. The agency also claimed that Aryan Khan and a woman named Pooja Dadlani, Shah Rukh Khan's manager, were tampering with the evidence and witnesses in the case in an attempt to derail the investigation. On the other side, Aryan Khan's advocates submitted to the HC an additional note, stating that he has nothing to do with the allegations and counter-allegations that are being circulated between the NCB's zonal director Sameer Wankhede and certain political personalities. The NCB on Tuesday filed its affidavit in response to the bail plea filed by Aryan Khan in the HC. A single bench of Justice N W Sambre is likely to take the plea for hearing later in the day. The anti-drugs agency in its affidavit said attempts are being made to tamper with the ongoing investigation with a malafide intention to derail the probe into the case. "This is evident from the contents of a purported affidavit of one Prabhakar Sail," the agency said, referring to the allegations of extortion attempt made by Sail, an independent witness in the case. The affidavit also referred to Pooja Dadlani and said "this lady appears to have influenced panch witnesses when the investigation is ongoing". The NCB said the bail plea was "misconceived and ill-conceived". It said the probe into the case so far has revealed Aryan Khan's role in illicit procurement, transportation and consumption of drugs. The agency said prima facie investigation has revealed that Aryan Khan used to procure drugs from his friend Arbaaz Merchant, also an accused in the case. "The applicant (Aryan Khan) was in touch with some persons abroad who appear to be part of an international drug network for illicit procurement of drugs," it said. The affidavit further said even though there has been no recovery from Aryan Khan, he has "participated in the conspiracy". "Prima facie investigation has revealed that this applicant is not just a mere consumer of drugs as sought to be made out by him," it said. The applicant has not made out any case for enlargement of bail, prima facie and/or otherwise, the NCB said. "The role of this applicant (Aryan Khan) in the commission of grave and serious offences under the NDPS Act including illicit drug trafficking is apparent considering the nexus and connection of this applicant with the other accused in the case," the affidavit said. It added that there has been the recovery of an intermediate quantity of drugs from the other accused in the case and hence, the case of Aryan Khan cannot be looked at in isolation. "The ingredients of conspiracy are clear and evident," the affidavit said, adding that in such cases the quantum of recovery of drugs from an individual accused becomes inconsequential. The NCB also said it is still probing the case and a charge sheet needs to be filed. It said the agency requires sufficient time to properly investigate the international linkages so as to approach the foreign agency concerned through proper channel, which would entail some more time. Meanwhile, Aryan Khan's advocates submitted to the HC an additional note stating that he has nothing to do with the allegations and counter-allegations that are being circulated between the NCB's zonal director Wankhede and certain political personalities. "The applicant (Aryan Khan) does not make any allegations against any individual in the prosecution department," the note said. It further said Aryan Khan has no connection with Prabhakar Sail, an independent witness in the case, who has made allegations of an extortion attempt against Wankhede and others.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-87
26-10-2021||India||Pegasus: SC to pronounce order on Wednesday on pleas seeking independent probe ||The Supreme Court is scheduled to pronounce verdict on Wednesday on a batch of pleas seeking independent probe into the Pegasus snooping matter. A bench comprising Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli had reserved order on September 13, saying it only wanted to know whether or not the Centre used the Pegasus spyware through illegal methods to allegedly snoop on citizens. The apex court had observed orally that it would set up a technical expert committee to inquire into the matter and pass an interim order on the pleas seeking an independent probe into the grievances of the alleged surveillance of certain eminent Indians by hacking their phones using Israeli firm NSO's spyware, Pegasus. The top court's observations on constituting the committee assume significance in view of the Centre's statement that it would set up an expert panel on its own to look into the entire issue. The apex court had said it would pronounce order in a few days and asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, to mention the case if the government had a re-think about filing a detailed affidavit. The bench had said that it only wanted to know from the Centre, which expressed unwillingness to file a detailed affidavit citing national security, whether Pegasus was used to allegedly spy on individuals and if it was done lawfully. Observing that concerns have been raised by journalists and others over violation of privacy in the Pegasus row, the top court had said it was not interested in knowing the details related to national security. The Centre maintained it did not wish to file a detailed affidavit on whether particular software is used or not as it was not a matter for public discussion and will not be in the "larger national interest". The law officer had contended that the disclosure of whether the country was using a particular software or not may cause harm and alert all potential targets, including terror groups. "We had to have your affidavit to understand your stand. We do not want to say anything further, the court had told Mehta, adding that if a spyware is used by the government then it has to be as per the procedure established by the law. The law officer had said the government has nothing to hide and that is why the Centre has on its own said it will constitute a committee of domain experts who will look into the allegations and report to the court. I am not averse to certain individuals claiming invasion of privacy. This is serious and must be gotten into. The question is whether it is Pegasus or something. Our stand is putting this into an affidavit will not serve national interest... Hence allow us to form a committee of domain experts without the government members, Mehta had added. The apex court was hearing a batch of pleas, including senior journalists N Ram and Sashi Kumar along with the Editors Guild of India, seeking an independent probe into the alleged Pegasus snooping matter. The pleas seeking independent probe are related to reports of alleged snooping by government agencies on eminent citizens, politicians and scribes by using Israeli firm NSO's spyware Pegasus. An international media consortium had reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on the list of potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus spyware.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-87

Karan Morwal is the son of Murli Morwal, the legislator from Badnagar in Ujjain district. Police had earlier announced a reward of Rs 25,000 on his arrest. Based on a tip-off, Karan Morwal (30) was arrested near Maksi town in Shajapur district, about 80 km from Indore, Jyoti Sharma, in-charge of the women's police station in Indore, told PTI. A joint team of women personnel and crime branch sleuths caught the accused while he was going in a car with an accomplice - Rahul Rathore, she said. While on the run, the accused used to hide at a place for some time and then shift to somewhere else, the official said, adding that they are also probing Rathore's role into it. After the arrest, a medical examination of the accused was conducted and he was being questioned, she said. He will be produced in a local court and police will seek his custody to ascertain the places where he was hiding all these months and who all helped him, she added. According to officials, the rape case was registered against Karan Morwal on April 2 this year at the women's police station in Indore. The woman complainant had alleged that he raped her on the pretext of marrying her, they said. On October 19, the police questioned the accused's younger brother Shivam as they suspected he was aware of his brother's hideout, the officials said. Eyewitnesses earlier said Congress MLA Murli Morwal had on October 19 arrived at Palasia police station here, located adjacent to the women's police station, and held a closed-door meeting with some officials. After he came out of the police station, media persons had asked him about his absconding son, but the legislator left while saying he didn't want to say anything to the media on the issue.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-87

On Monday, Chief Judicial Magistrate A N Dave asked Gandhi to appear on October 29 to record his statement further, after the testimony of two new witnesses were taken since the Congress leader last appeared before the court on June 24 this year. Prior to it, Gandhi had appeared before the court in October 2019 and pleaded not guilty for his comment. "The court on Monday orally directed Rahul Gandhi to appear on October 29 to record his further statement over the testimonies of two new witnesses. He is likely to remain present before the court between 3 pm and 6 pm on that day," Gandhi's lawyer Kirit Panwala said. BJP legislator from Surat, Purnesh Modi, had filed a complaint against Gandhi in April 2019 under Indian Penal Code Sections 499 and 500, that deal with defamation. In his complaint, the MLA had alleged that Gandhi while addressing a poll rally in 2019 defamed the entire Modi community by saying "how come all the thieves have Modi as the common surname?" Purnesh Modi is now a minister in the new Gujarat government led by Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, holding the portfolios of road and building, transport, civil aviation, and tourism and pilgrimage development. Since Gandhi's last appearance before the court, testimonies were taken of two more witnesses -- the then electoral officer of Kolar in Karnataka where the Congress leader made the speech, and a video recorder employed by the Election Commission to record his speech. In his speech at the rally in Kolar on April 13, 2019 ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, the then Congress president had reportedly asked, "Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi, Narendra Modi...how come they all have Modi as the common surname.

26-10-2021||India||Strengthening organisation should override personal ambitions, says Sonia||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday emphasised on the need for discipline and unity, saying strengthening the organisation must override personal ambitions. Chairing a meeting of top party leaders to evolve a strategy for assembly elections in five states early next year, she said the party must redouble its fight for the victims of the Union government's "worst excesses". Gandhi also expressed concern over the party's messages on key issues not percolating down to the grassroot cadres, and said there is lack of clarity and cohesion even among state leaders. Former party chief Rahul Gandhi also attended the meeting of party general secretaries, in-charges and Pradesh Congress presidents at the AICC headquarters here. The leaders have also come together to chalk out a strategy for the party's new membership drive and finalise the modalities for it. The drive is starting from November 1 and will continue till March 31 next year. "I would like to re-emphasise the paramount need for discipline and unity. What should matter to each and every one of us is the strengthening of the organisation. This must override personal ambitions. In this lies both collective and individual success," Sonia Gandhi said in her opening remarks. Stressing on training programmes for party workers, the Congress chief said it should be taken up on priority. "The fight to defend our democracy, our constitution and the Congress party's ideology begins with being fully prepared to identify and counter false propaganda. "We must fight the diabolical campaign of BJP/RSS ideologically. We must do so with conviction and expose their lies before the people if we are to win this battle," she said. Noting that AICC releases important and detailed statements almost every day on issues facing the nation, Sonia Gandhi said, "But it is my experience that they do not percolate down to our grass root cadres at the block and district level. There are policy issues on which I find a lack of clarity and cohesion even amongst our state-level leaders." Attacking the Modi government, she said it has sought to erode our institutions so it may evade accountability and has sought to undermine the core values of our constitution so it can hold itself to a lower standard. It has questioned the very fundamentals of our democracy, she said. "We must redouble our fight for those who are the victims of this government's worst excesses: our farmers and farm labourers, our youth fighting for jobs and opportunities, small and medium scale businesses, our brothers, our sisters with particular focus on the deprived," she stressed. On the elections to five states, the Congress leader said our campaign must be founded upon concrete policies and programmes emanating from widespread discussions with all sections of society. Assembly elections in the states of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur are slated early next year.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-87
26-10-2021||India||CLC Classes: The Exuberant Jaunts towards Language Learning and Self-Discovery||It’s 4:55 pm on a sweltering evening of May. With the ‘new normal’ of online classes, I briskly connect my laptop to the scheduled CLC class at 5 pm with a concomitant thought playing at the back of my mind—“The day is almost over…will they turn up?” Tomy Surprise and utter delight, I see the screen filled up with bright faces, all set to enjoy (according to them) the most coveted time, not only of the day, but of the entire week! Seeing them exploring their speaking, debating and presenting skills fills me with contentment—the greatest reward we can ever expect as facilitators. This is the joy and vivacity of learning that NSHM Centre of Language and Communication (NCLC) promises to brighten and contour the lives of our students with. With young, talented faculty members who bring in innovative ways of teaching Language Proficiency, Essential Communication Skills, Personality Development, Public Speaking and full-fledged Foreign Language Courses into their classes, NSHM Centre of Language and Communication (NCLC) has made a substantive mark for itself among students, who have immensely acknowledged its contribution towards enriching their language proficiency and preparing them for the industry. Lisa Roy, my student from BBA First Year, Durgapur campus, writes to me—“In those two hours of weekly CLC classes, we have literally learnt so many things like how to be confident, how to present yourself in front of the interviewer and so on. The GD and case studies made us more confident and knowledgeable. We have tried to acquire as much as we can this semester. I hope you will teach us more tips and tricks next semester”. Isha Kumari from the same batch writes: “The CLC classes enabled me to improve my communication skills. They were really interactive sessions. We got a chance to put our opinions in front of all by which we gained a lot of information about our current surroundings. Every week we had 2 hours of conversation. CLC classes also helped me to improve my English language proficiency as well as my body language. Regular classes can definitely enrich your vocabulary and you can communicate frankly with others. From my experience I would say, CLC classes were really amazing”. Arpan Dey, who is currently pursuing his BBA in Hospital Management and is in his second semester, writes:“I’ve really enjoyed each CLC class and learnt very informative lessons including presentation skills, interview skills, telephone etiquettes, group discussion skills and many more which are absolutely necessary for us to be professional and efficient to get our target jobs.”The centre has been helping our students realise their true penchant for self-development which have also assisted them abundantly in coping with the psychological adversities posed by the pandemic. Amidst the stifling conditions of lockdown, contagion and closed campuses, students have been incarcerated within the four walls of their homes for the past 16 months! A part of life that was meant to be lived and enjoyed in exhilarated classrooms, bustling corridors and mirthful hostel rooms are being mundanely spent in front of Smartphones and laptop screens. Enthusiastic conversations that were to take place in the college coffee-shop or in the canteen, on the lush green lawn or by the lake—are being conducted over voice or video calls, gradually drifting them far away from each other. With CLC classes which are dedicated to conversational skills and debating skills, students get to interact with each other, which not only enhance their professional communication skills but also let them suspend their worries for the time being. Group discussion sessions at times enable them to go beyond the virtual plane and actually imagine themselves to be in a tangible class! This is particularly applicable to the students whose college life started online and might possibly remain so unless the pandemic withdraws its shadow from our lives. They have only met their classmates and teachers online and are awaiting the day when they get to see each other in person. These students look at the CLC classes as a gateway to each other’s lives, as ceaseless interactions let them know their friends a little better. Online elocution competitions, inter-college essay writing and debate competitions organized by CLC have not only kept the mengaged but have also encouraged them to go that extra mile in exploring their talents. Besides the language proficiency classes, communication classes and other events organised by the centre, a major attraction of the students have undoubtedly been the Foreign Language courses offered by CLC. Many students, including final year students, have taken up Foreign Language courses of their choice to broaden their scope of employability. Laboni Maji of BCA Durgapur (Batch of 2018) who took up a course on German language says: “The foreign language classes are very informative and interactive. This class has increased myinterestinlearningnewlanguages.Weareconstantlyencouragedtoparticipateintheclassand are asked for our feedback. Classes are planned and modified according to our requirements. While taking the basic course, I was facing some problem in speaking. However, it has improved now and I am still working on it to enhance it further. Overall it's a nice experience; I am really enjoying the classes.” Shubhanjan Sinha, a student of BCA Durgapur (Batchof2018) says: “I have completed the basic language proficiency course in Spanish language and I must say that it has been one of the highlights of my 3 years in NSHM. Our teachers are very nice and supportive. The way they explain grammar and non-grammatical sections are very interesting. Currently I'm in the intermediate level of the Spanish language course. If I get the opportunity in the future I would be definitely going for the advance level course.” Such heart-warming, honest feedbacks from our students give us hope. The hope to strive further in making a positive change in their lives so that the tenure they spend with us becomes a treasure for a lifetime for them. As an institute, we never let the pandemic take at all on our teaching-learning process and as a centre, CLC has ensured that the online platform is used to the optimum level in enhancing the language skills and employability skills of our students. However, it is worth admitting that nothing can replace the experience and thrill of an actual class. The classrooms are the little worlds which the students create with their teachers a space where they learn, explore and make memories. We dearly wait to get back to our classes and bear witnesses to our students living their dreams. Until then, we hope to make the most of our virtual interactions and ensure that the journey towards language learning and self-discovery continues with the same dynamism and alacrity.

26-10-2021||India||Think pandemic is the only challenge? Think again||The pandemic has disrupted education and learning at a time when people were least expecting it. At the School of Computing and Analytics at NSHM Kolkata, we moved to online classes from the 3rd week of March 2020, even before the lockdown was declared by the government. The students and the teachers were tech-savvy, so the operational shift from offline to online was smooth. Yet, it turned out receiving education and learning through digital medium in the pandemic was a challenge. Or was it? Story 1: It was the third week of March, 2020 when the online classes started and I began my class on Machine learning at 11AM sharp. In the first 15 minutes of the class, only one student joined the virtual class but without any further ado, I decided to start teaching. I made sure, I was properly connected and as I proceed, I asked my student, “Can you hear me?”. Rinki unmuted herself and said, “Yes ma’am”; assuring me I was indeed audible but I was surprised to hear commotion coming from her end. “Rinki, where are you?” I asked and her reply stunned me when she said “Ma’am, I am at the Howrah station, boarding a train…” Oh my God! Story 2: A few months later, it was around second week of May 2020, when the pandemic has been announced officially and virtual classes were going on full-fledgedly. I was taking a class on Digital Marketing when suddenly a woman’s voice boomed from behind a particular screen “beta, chawal chaddha diya hai kya?” to which my student, Ram instantly replied, “Haan Maa” and I was quick to mute him because the class was being recorded. Story 3: Another year passed, the situation had not got any better and it was already the second week of May 2021 when a new batch had joined whose initial lessons started online without any face to face meet with their mentors. I was taking my machine learning classes as usual but I was worriedby reports of students’ inattentiveness in class coming from all around. I checked on the new students from time to time by calling out their names with the hope of a little interaction.When I called out a student named Raja, I heard the blaring noise of traffic in the background. He was on the road travelling somewhere while attending a class and in the middle of a pandemic! These are my real life experiences during the pandemic while conducting the online classes (names of the students are fictitious). None of those students were insincere in their studies; it was just unfortunate circumstances. Rinki was going back to her hometown as students were asked to vacate hostels and just like the millions of migrant workers, were struggling to get back home. Rinki was lucky to get a train ticket andshe joined the class from wherever she was whileher classmates were still struggling to get a ticket.Ram was helping his mother with the household chores balancing it with the classes as househelps were unable to come to work due to the strict lockdown. Later, I got to know that Raja was out to procure oxygen cylinders for an ailing person. These students of mine were heroes without the cape. Life is a great teacher. In the pandemic, life taught us to be compassionate, be grit to cope with adversities and survive. Discussions around education and learning during the pandemic revolved around online vs offline (mediums) and Zoom vs Teams (platforms). To me, the real issue is learning to survive vs learning the lessons. If we fast forward 50 years, offline classes may be a distant history. The students of the future are likely to attend virtual classes with the environment of a class brought into the drawing room, aided by technology. The online vs offline and platform debate too will become history. Machine learning and digital marketing are likely to evolve beyond recognition. But the compassion, grit, learning to cope and survive will stay with the students forever. This article is authored by Dr. Suparna Dhar.

26-10-2021||India||Panchaali The Princess of Peace : A gripping story by Saniya Inamdar||To all the enthusiasts of Indian mythology and avid viewers of the Mahabharata on TV, Draupadi is a word synonymous with Disrobing! To the sensitive mind it is synonymous with Dishonour! And to the author it was in sync with Dignity which should have been bestowed on a character known as an arbitrator of war and gore! Panchaali the Princess of Peace is the story of a mythological character that emerges from the fire as full grown woman, with a prelapsarian naiveté which made it hard for her to understand and live in a world because of its newness! Panchaali as created by Inamdar is an intrigued, restless soul who seeks questions, fathoms deceptions, harbours fears and speaks her mind well before her disrobing! Panchaali in the story refuses to marry the five Pandava brothers and walks the path of honour and Peace! The book is not a feminist retelling of the story of a protagonist who was stripped of all her pride unabashedly in front of her mishpocha! It is a clarion call for each individual to fight for ones dignity and also be a torch bearer for the respect of others. The book portrays this similitude in the honest and soul stirring friendship between Panchaali (Draupadi) and Krishna! Dushasana kept dragging me by my hair, demeaning me, mocking me, chastising me, and belittling my very existence with his brutal hold and vulgar tongue! Even as I begged for relief, for help, I was begging for dignity, for respect that was of any woman to own in any circumstance or time! It seemed impossible in this situation, but the cruelty of the man and my fear made it a stark reality! Why only till that moment I was the revered Queen whose false haughtiness and impeccable beauty were the talk of endless banters! Only till a moment ago, I was a wife to five husbands and yet I found none of them in my plight! I was a Queen and not of any ordinary Kingdom nor of undistinguished men! Like the endless labyrinth, the moment seemed endless. Why didn’t somebody come to my rescue! How could this man yield so much of power to destroy a woman piece by piece through his immoral touch and verbal vituperations! How inexhaustible and unbounded was Dushasanas’ viciousness. He seemed to derive an opportune pleasure from my pain! Oh stop it, stop it, I pleaded in despair, wishing for an end or some safe harbour in this amaranthine situation! What made the situation worse and my foreboding full of discomposure was my state of Rajasvala! I was in my month, in a single piece of cloth with my navel exposed! Why was this wretched man taking me to a court full of men in this delicate and vulnerable state, what did he intend to do by taking me there! I was already in a weakened state by nature. Why didn’t this man sympathize with my situation! Could it really be me! Could this then be my identity, a woman so weak, so defenseless that she could not even seek relief in her most private days! He dragged, and I protested; he laughed, and I beseeched; he violated, and I implored to deaf haughty corrupted ears till he threw me in a court dignified! Proudly, I stood my ground as I tried to stand up and reckon my place in the court! This could not be happening to me. This was not my reality, and this should be no one’s reality! I feared not a single man in the world leave alone those in the impotent room! Why did I need to be afraid of any man or any human till the time I respected my boundaries and theirs! When I caused no harm, why would any other violate my sense of wellbeing! Naïve, foolish, fleeceable, Panglossian, and deluded! Never was a woman raped verbally by abuses, by insinuations, by immodesty, by blatant brazenness as I was in that court, by men who were in my relations and witnessed by men, great men whose glory would be revered by generations to come! I tried to bear the stage and my predicament by rendering it phantasmal; it was not me who was called a whore, a woman unchaste who slept with five men, five brothers, a slave woman! I lived through those words as if it was an illusion! But as soon as the man called out for my disrobing, I could no longer pretend or fool myself of my gross predicament! I could fight their verbal arrows and abuses, but where did I take refuge when I was to be stripped of all decency! It was frightening to the pit of my belly. Why did their revenge border on my decency! Was this their idea of getting even with the Pandavas to destroy me completely! Is this the utmost that men could do, how imbecile and puerile to the point of absurdity! To take revenge meant to deprecate a woman! To belittle a woman meant to disrobe her and bring her nakedness to fore! Couldn’t their small minds come up with an idea of revenge in a genteel form! Hadn’t they seen nakedness of a woman in their own homes, with their wives! I placed the men who abused me in the same dishonourable stratum as the men who bet on my name! Why weren’t the Pandavas disrobed of their apparels! Weren’t they also the losers! It was not revenge that the enemy was seeking; it was lecherous, depraved, viciousness! I stood vulnerable and yet so proud, so defamed and yet so honourable! Trembling inside amidst the sea of empty relations and feeble excuses, I knew there was nothing I could do to protect my modesty! I saw Dushasana going for the kill and I closed my eyes! As I prayed to the creator, I wished I was given a chance to have averted this precarious quagmire of mine!||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-87
26-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur Kheri: SC directs UP to grant protection to witnesses||The Supreme Court Tuesday directed the Uttar Pradesh government to grant protection to the witnesses of Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people including four farmers were killed during a farmers' protest. A bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana asked the UP government, represented by senior advocates Harish Salve and Garima Prasad, to record the statements of other relevant witnesses before judicial magistrates under Section 164 of the CrPC. We direct the District Judge concerned to entrust the task of recording of evidence under Section 164 of the CrPC to the nearest judicial magistrates available, said the bench which also comprised Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli. Statements under Section 164 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) are recorded before a judicial magistrate and they have evidentiary value. The bench asked Salve to convey its concerns to forensic labs and experts on preparation of reports on electronic evidence of the incident and also directed the state government to file its report on two complaints including the one related to the lynching of a journalist. The state is directed to file separate replies in the cases, the bench said and fixed the plea for further hearing on November 8. During the hearing, the bench raised the question over the number of eyewitnesses made by the prosecution in the case and said, "The case is that thousands of farmers were going on and a rally was going on. Only 23 witnesses are eyewitnesses?" Salve said that out of 68 witnesses, statements of 30 witnesses have been recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC and some more testimonies will be recorded. "Of these 30 witnesses, 23 claim to be eyewitnesses. A lot of witnesses are formal witnesses of recovery and all", Salve said. He also submitted several digital pieces of evidence that have been recovered and sent for examination by experts. The Supreme Court had on October 20 had rapped the government, saying the court was getting the impression that the state police was dragging its feet, and also ordered the protection of witnesses. The apex court was hearing a matter about the October 3 violence in Lakhimpur Kheri in which eight persons including four farmers were killed during a farmers' protest and over ten accused, including Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra's son Ashish Mishra, have been arrested so far in the case. The Supreme Court had on October 20 had rapped the government, saying the court was getting the impression that the state police was dragging its feet, and also ordered the protection of witnesses In the previous hearing last week, the UP government was told sternly by the judges to "dispel the feeling that you are dragging your feet" on the case. The judges had asked why more witnesses had not been questioned by the UP government. "You have recorded the statements of only four witnesses so far out of 44. Why not more?", Chief Justice Ramana had questioned. The court had, even then, ordered the UP government to protect and record the statement of all witnesses and said: "This should not be an unending story". Ashish Mishra is accused of running over four farmers during a protest on October 3. More were killed in the violence that erupted afterwards. The Supreme Court, on the complaint of the families of BJP workers killed in the violence, asked the UP government for a separate report on the killing of four more persons, including a journalist. Ashish Mishra was arrested on October 11, three days after the Supreme Court expressed dissatisfaction with the Uttar Pradesh government's progress in the case. The Supreme Court had asked the Yogi Adityanath government to list in a status report how many have been arrested over the killing of eight persons and on what charges. In the last hearing, the court was upset about the report being filed "last-minute". Both Ashish Mishra and his father have denied all charges. Mishra had told NDTV that the car belonged to his family but neither he nor his son was in it when the incident took place.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-88

26-10-2021||India||Neyaz Khalid Noor Expresses Concern As India’s Youth Is Trapped Into Drugs||This is a harrowing reality to face. It is pretty difficult to believe that our youth are developing dangerous, addictive habits at such an early age, especially right under our nose. We want to believe it is just a phase. But on the other hand, there is an indisputable link between substance abuse and delinquency. Arrest, adjudication, and intervention by the juvenile justice system are eventual consequences for many youths engaged in alcohol and other drug use. Why are teens more susceptible to drugs? In such cases, we usually blame experimentation, or the other kids at school for our children’s early drug use. The last thing we want to come across is that our children are in danger, or that this substance use is something our sons and daughters have brought upon themselves. If we try to understand this ‘menace’ at a very basic level, we see that there are several mental health issues such as depression, developmental lags, apathy, withdrawal, and other psychosocial dysfunctions frequently linked to substance abuse among adolescents. Drug usage is always associated with a variety of negative consequences, that includes increased risk of serious drug use later in life, school failure, and poor judgment which may put teens at risk for accidents, violence, unplanned and unsafe sex, and suicide. Switzerland has long stood out internationally for its innovative approach to the problem of drug addiction, adopting a drug policy in the early 1990s when hundreds of addicts occupied public spaces in the cities of Zurich and Bern. “Switzerland has applied a ‘four pillars’ policy: prevention, therapy, harm reduction and repression (law enforcement). The model is greatly regarded by addiction professionals and has proven effective. Since its adoption, the number of deaths resulting from drug consumption has decreased, criminality has declined, the health of addicts has vastly enhanced and open drug scenes have disappeared. I feel like if India also goes for a similar approach then we can definitely solve the problem to some extent as the important thing is to break the supply chain” added Neyaz Khalid Noor, Social activist. If we look into our mass entertainment medium then even a few years ago, they have portrayed alcoholism in a very glamorous light & have influenced young minds with a completely wrong notion of ‘Being Cool’. Substance addiction not only spoils but also destroys a life which directly means it is a curse for any person. As we all, youngsters are innocent and they need the right guidance at their homes and schools. Parents, teachers and elders should always be empathetic and communicative with the youngsters so that they can easily talk out their issues and feelings, all they need is a good listener and a guide who can hold their hands and show them the right path. If the youngsters feel protected and they know that they have some trustworthy people in their lives with whom they can freely express their feelings and problems then there is no scope for any wrong way to intervene in their minds and life.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-88

The official had also claimed that he was being personally targeted by a well-known political figure (Malik), and the only reason he can fathom is that the NCB had arrested "this person's son-in-law Sameer Khan". Malik said he is forwarding a letter written by someone in NCB about the various illegal activities of Wankhede' to the agency's DG S N Pradhan. The NCP minister said the NCB should investigate the 26 allegations in the letter claiming an extortion racket' being run within the anti-drugs agency.

The incident took place when the victims were asleep, they said. The deceased have been identified as Horilal (59), his wife Reena (55), their son Ashu (24) and daughter Rohini (18). The family members were sleeping on the third floor of the house, while their 22-year-old son Akshay had a narrow escape as he was sleeping on the second floor, they said. A call about the fire was received at around 4 am and four fire tenders were rushed to the spot, said Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Services. Domestic articles in a room on the third floor of the house caught fire, resulting in the death of four people. The victims were found dead on the spot. The building comprised ground plus three floors and situated in an area of about 25 square yards, he said, adding that it was a minor fire. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Shahadra) R Sathiyasundaram said, "Our police team and Delhi Fire Services staff reached the spot immediately and the fire was brought under control. The crime team, officials from Forensic Science Laboratory and other senior officials also visited the scene of incidence." Police said the fire might have broke out and spread across the third floor of the building. The victims might have died due to inhaling smoke, but only the post-mortem report will be able to ascertain the exact cause of death. Akshay, the only surviving member of the family, works as a labourer in Safiabad. He had come home at around 2 am after work. He went to the third floor to get food and later slept on the second floor. He survived since the fire did not spread from the third floor of the building, police said. Horilal was working as a peon in Shastri Bhawan, Delhi and was due to retire in March 2022. His wife worked as a sweeper in MCD. His daughter was a class 12 student at a government school while his son was unemployed, they said. All the bodies have been shifted to Guru Teg Bahadur hospital mortuary for post-mortem, they said. A case has been registered under IPC section 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house) and 304A (causing death by negligence), the DCP said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-88

The owner of the firm, Laxmi Narayan Patnaik, was arrested and four women were rescued from there. “One of the employees turned up at the police station alleging that in the name of arranging jobs for them, the firm was forcing girls into flesh trade. Following the complaint, we conducted a raid and seized several identity cards,” the police said. Bhubaneswar DC Uma Shankar Das said: “An immoral trafficking case has been lodged in this connection.” “No one had thought that a sex racket could be going on inside a consultancy centre. Even the neighbours had no idea about the racket till we raided the place in Mancheswar,” the police said. The police found it surprising that inside the consultancy centre, there were nearly 10 rooms for servicing the customers. The police have seized a number of incriminating documents including a number of identity cards issued to girls in the name of various companies. Nearly three such sex rackets have been busted in the city during this year so far.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-88

The deaths occurred on Sunday night but came to light on Monday. The incident occurred in the twin villages — Bellaur and Bellauri — under Guthni police station spreading panic in the area because nobody was sure how many people had consumed illicit liquor. Three of the deceased are from Bellaur while another is from Bellauri. A large number of villagers alleged the deaths occurred because of consumption of hooch, which they said was freely available in the area bordering Uttar Pradesh. On the other hand, family members of the deceased refused to speak on the issue, as they were apparently afraid of being implicated in cases related to flouting of prohibition. “My father used to drink daily. He came home on Saturday night and was feeling uneasy. He was taken to a local doctor on Sunday morning, who treated him for cardiac arrest and then referred him to Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh. My family members took him to a private hospital there. He died at around 10.30pm,” Mukesh Kumar Ram, son of deceased Dukh Haran Ram, told The Telegraph. As the family members of the deceased mourned and information about the deaths spread, district administration and police officials rushed to the two villages to make enquiries. Siwan DM Amit Kumar Pandey told this newspaper that bodies of three persons have been sent for post-mortem though the local people were claiming that four had died. “The deaths were reported on Monday morning. We have been able to trace three bodies so far and sent them for post-mortem. The matter is under investigation and we will be able to ascertain the reasons of death only after the post-mortem reports come,” Pandey said. “Special operations are being conducted in a 3-4km radius from the villages to catch people who could be involved in brewing illicit liquor,” Pandey added. There have been a series of hooch deaths in Bihar since chief minister Nitish Kumar brought a law to ban liquor manufacturing, trade and consumption in the state. Lacklustre policing and a nexus between law enforcement agencies and liquor mafia are said to be the main reasons behind the deaths attributed to hooch consumption. Over 45 people have lost their lives in separate hooch tragedies in Kaimur, Muzaffarpur, Nawada, West Champaran, Vaishali and Siwan districts this year.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-88
26-10-2021||India||Congress seeks probe into Facebook-BJP ties ||The Congress on Monday said Facebook was a “diabolical tool” in the hands of bigoted regimes to subvert democracy and demanded a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to investigate its nexus with the BJP in India. Referring to the fresh revelations by a whistleblower, which suggested how the social media platform took no action against the BJP’s hate campaign, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said: “This only goes on to prove that Facebook is nothing but a subjugated vicious diabolical tool used by the ruling regime and its proxies to propagate bigotry, hate and fear in the minds of the oppressed and marginalised in India. The absolute callous attitude of the company towards the people of India is reflective in the fact that they spend 87 per cent of their misinformation budget policing English speaking audiences, whereas those audiences make up only 9 per cent of their base.” The Congress asked both the Narendra Modi government and Facebook to answer these questions: “1. Despite knowing all of this, why hasn’t Facebook designated the RSS and the Bajrang Dal as ‘dangerous organisations’ based on its own internal reports? 2. While the government of India had been extremely proactive against Twitter citing social media safety compliance, why are they not uttering a word now?” Demanding a JPC probe, Khera said: “The internal reports and recommendations of Facebook’s security team went against the recommendations of Facebook’s safety team; in so far as they prioritised commercial interests over safety of Indian citizens, and yet no action has been taken by the government, doesn’t this clearly implicate the presence of a quid pro quo?” Describing the BJP as “all weather ally” of the Facebook, Khera recalled the murky episode involving former Facebook India head Ankhi Das, who was questioned by the parliamentary panel on the alleged bias in dealing with hate speeches, including her own internal postings detailing her explicit support for the ruling BJP. But, despite her resignation, the camaraderie and nexus between the BJP and Facebook never ended, he quipped. Khera said: “Facebook’s safety team earlier in 2020 had concluded that the Bajrang Dal supported violence against minorities across the country; it was speculated that Facebook was on the verge of designating them as a ‘dangerous organisation’ and ban them from the platform. But, subsequent to a report by Facebook’s security team, which stated, ‘besides risking infuriating India’s ruling nationalist politicians, banning Bajrang Dal might precipitate physical attacks against Facebook personnel and facilities’, and thus, the social media giant caved in and prioritised their business over the safety of millions of Indians.” The latest expose that prompted the Congress attack is the leaked research documents by whistleblower Frances Haugen, a 37yearold engineer who worked at Facebook. It showed Facebook knew they were not equipped to filter hate speech in Hindi through the course of the 2019 elections and the brutal Delhi riots, but they took no action. Their own internal reports have identified fake accounts with over a million impressions. India is the largest market for Facebook with about 370 million users. An internal assessment by Facebook suggested that only 0.2 per cent of reported hate speech was being taken down. Khera said: “Many internal studies and reports by Facebook that have now been leaked explicitly suggest that it is groups and entities affiliated with the RSS, Bajrang Dal and their political proxy BJP that have been at the forefront of largescale extensive hate speech campaigns and hatemongering by spreading targeted misinformation against a particular community.” The Congress insisted that any agency, any company, Indian or foreign, cannot undermine constitutional values, which govern this country. “Come what may, if Twitter does something wrong today, we will speak against Twitter and if the government does something wrong against any such company, we will again speak up. There is a rule of law, which governs the conduct of these companies. There is a rule of law, which governs my rights as a consumer of these platforms and Congress party will always stand by rule of law, by the Constitution, which governs our country.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-89
26-10-2021||India||Maharashtra BJP MP boasts of impunity from ED||A BJP parliamentarian has said he doesn’t fear the Enforcement Directorate because he is an MP from the BJP, indirectly buttressing Opposition allegations that the Narendra Modi government has been using central investigative agencies to hound political rivals. Sunday’s comment by Sanjay Patil, MP from Sangli in Maharashtra, came days after party MLA Harshvardhan Patil too publicly said he was getting “sound sleep” after joining the BJP from the Congress since there are now “no inquiries”. “The ED won’t come after me since I am a BJP MP,” a smiling Sanjay Patil said, speaking in a lighter vein, while inaugurating a shopping mall in his constituency. A video shows the MP asserting in Marathi that wealthy politicians are often unfairly accused of corruption, when a fellow dignitary on the dais says something to him that cannot be clearly heard. The MP, who owns two sugar mills, then makes the comment about the ED. Sources suggested that Sanjay Patil had been keen to join Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls but backed out for fear of facing a probe by a central agency. When The Telegraph called the MP’s number, he said he had just arrived in “Bombay” and would talk after 15-20 minutes. When this newspaper called after a while, his phone was switched off. Central agencies like the ED, CBI, income-tax department and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) have launched probes against several non-BJP politicians in Maharashtra since the BJP lost power to a Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress coalition in 2019, triggering allegations of vendetta. Similar charges have been levelled elsewhere in the country too. Earlier this month, Harshvardhan Patil, who had defected from the Congress to the BJP ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly polls in 2019, was quoted by PTI as saying at an event: “We too had to go to BJP. He (referring to someone from the Opposition sitting next to him on the dais) asked why I had joined BJP. I told him to ask his leader why I went to BJP.” He added: “Everything is easygoing and peaceful (in the BJP). I get sound sleep as there are no inquiries.” Later, the four-time Maharashtra MLA claimed his comment had been misinterpreted. NCP leaders have suggested the recent NCB drugs raid and arrest of Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan also reflects political victimisation. “Drugs will become sugar powder if Shah Rukh Khan joins the BJP,” Maharashtra minister and NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal had said on Saturday. The ED has lodged money-laundering cases against several NCP and Sena leaders, including former state home minister Anil Deshmukh and fellow NCP leader Eknath Khadse. The agency recently questioned Shiv Sena MP Bhawana Gawli and his party colleague and state transport minister Anil Parab. The ED has searched Sena MP Anand Adsul’s residence and offices in connection with a cooperative bank scandal. “Never heard of so many ED actions in Maharashtra,” Pawar said recently. The ED had filed a money-laundering case against Pawar and his nephew Ajit ahead of the 2019 Assembly polls. Among senior Opposition politicians investigated by central agencies is Congress veteran and former Union finance minister P. Chidambaram who was arrested by the CBI and the ED in 2019. Karnataka Congress MLA D.K. Shivakumar was put in jail for weeks in an assets case by the income-tax authorities in 2019. In 2015, the CBI raided the residence of then Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh of the Congress on the day of his daughter’s wedding.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-89
26-10-2021||India||Mohammad Shami trolled after India’s loss to Pakistan||On a day industrialist Sanjiv Goenka and an investment firm committed over Rs 12,700 crore or $1.7 billion to buy two new IPL teams, some Indians were indulging in what is increasingly becoming another national pastime. Cricketer Mohammad Shami was treated to the filthiest of abuses by trolls, most of whom referenced his religion, after India’s loss to Pakistan in the T20 World Cup match. If Rahul Gandhi led the political field in expressing solidarity with Shami, the silence at the other end of the spectrum was marked by the usual indifference that Prime Minister Narendra Modi displays when faced with such choices. Till Monday night, neither Modi nor any other Union minister had condemned the attacks on Shami. Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were among those who “supported” and “stood by” Shami but few spoke of the reason that has made such a blizzard of communal attacks the “new normal” in India. Rahul Gandhi tweeted: “Mohammad #Shami we are all with you. These people are filled with hate because nobody gives them any love. Forgive them.” Sachin, whose image had taken an unprecedented knock when he echoed the official stand after singer Rihanna tweeted about the farmers’ movement in India, wrote: “When we support #TeamIndia, we support every person who represents Team India.” Sachin continued: “@MdShami11 is a committed, world-class bowler. He had an off day like any other sportsperson can have. I stand behind Shami & Team India.” Sehwag tweeted: “The online attack on Mohammad Shami is shocking and we stand by him. He is a champion and Anyone who wears the India cap has India in their hearts far more than any online mob. With you Shami….” It was not always like this — players did not routinely face hate attacks after a loss. Irfan Pathan tweeted: “Even I was part of #IndvsPak battles on the field where we have lost but never been told to go to Pakistan! I’m talking about the India of few years back.” It took broadcaster Raunak Kapoor to hit the nail on the head: “Mohammed Shami wasn’t viciously abused because he had an ‘off-day’. 9 players had an off-day yesterday. While it’s nice to see support for him from current & former players, would be prudent for them to also acknowledge & condemn the reason for it.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-89
26-10-2021||India||Kashmir cheers Pakistan win over India during Shah visit||Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday snubbed Farooq Abdullah’s request for talks with Islamabad as all around him Kashmiris erupted in joy at Pakistan’s victory over India in the T20 World Cup. Valley residents burst firecrackers overnight and videos showed Kashmiris, apparently including students from a premier medical college in Srinagar, dancing and cheering Pakistan’s victory. Shah, visiting Jammu and Kashmir since Saturday, did not react to the celebrations but officials said they had come as an embarrassment for lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha’s administration. Some Kashmiri students studying in neighbouring Punjab have alleged their counterparts from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Haryana barged into their rooms and roughed them up for celebrating Pakistan’s win. Nasir Khouhami, national spokesperson for the Jammu and Kashmir Students’ Association, said over a dozen students were beaten up, seven suffering grievous injuries. Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti appeared to justify the celebrations. “Why such anger against Kashmiris for celebrating Pak’s win? Some are even chanting murderous slogans — desh ke gadaaron ko goli maaro/ calling to shoot traitors,” she tweeted. “One hasnt forgotten how many celebrated by distributing sweets when J&K was dismembered & stripped of special status.” Shah bristled at Srinagar MP and former chief minister Farooq’s call for talks with Pakistan. “I read in newspapers that Farooq Abdullah has suggested the government should talk to Pakistan. He has a right to his opinion but we would rather talk to the Kashmiri youth,” Shah told a gathering at the Sher-i-Kashmir International Convention Centre on the Dal Lake’s shores. “But I want to tell Farooq Sahab and all of you that if there has to be talks, I shall hold them with my brothers and sisters from the Valley, with the youth of the Valley. Why should I not talk to you, we want to talk to you, that is why I extended the hand of friendship to the youth of the Valley.” Shah is on his first visit to Jammu and Kashmir since the August 2019 dilution of Article 370, arriving amid a spurt in militant violence. He has during the trip made repeated peace overtures to the youth, saying they and not the Indian government can weed out militancy. Shah was to end his visit on Monday but has extended it by a day, apparently to be part of “Accession Day” celebrations. Jammu and Kashmir had acceded to India on October 26, 1947. At the gathering, Shah asked the organisers to remove the bullet-proof screen so he could talk to the audience “frankly” and “without any security”. The venue, however, has been off limits for ordinary citizens for the past three days, with all the roads leading to it sealed. The few hundred visitors who attended the event were thoroughly screened before entering. Shah said those who advocate talks with Islamabad and separatists should be asked what Pakistan had done for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. “Compare the development between this side and PoK. Do they have electricity, roads, healthcare and toilets? There is nothing (on the other side). You have the same rights as any other Indian,” he said. Shah vowed to eradicate militancy and end the civilian killings. He said he had been taunted and condemned “in very harsh words” after he announced the scrapping of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in 2019. He defended the Internet curbs and curfew imposed in the aftermath of the constitutional changes, claiming “some people would have misled the masses” and killings would have taken place.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-89
26-10-2021||India||Rs 64,000cr govt mission to plug health gaps ||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday launched a Rs 64,000-crore government mission that seeks to fill gaps in public health infrastructure nationwide through additional facilities ranging from critical care beds to labs to surveillance units. The Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission will add 35,000 critical care-linked beds in 600 districts and establish 730 public health labs, 3,000 block public health units, and 15 biosafety labs, among other facilities, to support diagnostics and disease surveillance, the Centre said. Doctors and health experts have welcomed the mission but cautioned that its success will hinge on funding and commitment to establishing physical infrastructure and ensuring that sufficient numbers of adequately trained personnel are available to support its objectives. “In post-independent India, health infrastructure did not get the required attention for a very long time and citizens had to run from pillar to post for proper treatment,” Modi said, launching the mission that he claimed would strengthen healthcare infrastructure at the village, district, regional and national levels. The initiative comes months after India’s second Covid-19 wave exposed gaps in healthcare services across the country. A senior official in the Union health ministry said the planned 35,000 critical care beds would all be in public facilities distributed across 600 districts in the country. The added beds would raise India’s count of critical care beds to over 170,000, nearly twice the number before Covid-19. “This is a welcome initiative — the idea for a separate pool of funds for health infrastructure was first proposed and discussed over 10 or 12 years ago,” said T. Sundararaman, a community medicine expert and former executive director of the health ministry’s National Health Systems Resource Centre. Critical care medicine specialists said the mission should give equal emphasis to staffing facilities. “For this to be successful, critical care facilities will need doctors, nurses, technicians on the ground before they open — on day zero,” Srinivas Samavedam, a critical care medicine specialist and general secretary of the Indian Society for Critical Care Medicine (ISCCM), told The Telegraph. Most critical care specialists are currently clustered in large metropolitan cities and tier-II towns. The ISCCM has around 12,000 members, but postgraduates in anaesthesia, pulmonology or medicine could also be trained for critical care. “There is currently an acute shortage,” said Deepak Govil, ISCCM president, who estimates that the nationwide count of fresh doctors who complete superspecialisation or undergo specialised training for critical care would touch around 400 per year. Samavedam, a member of an ISCCM expert panel on the design of critical care units, said critical care beds also ideally require key complementary infrastructure such as a blood bank, a CT scan facility, an operation theatre, and a cath lab for procedures such as angiography or angioplasty. The treatment of acute respiratory infections, heart attacks, obstetric complications, strokes or traumatic injuries that typically make up a large proportion of complications needing critical care might require such complementary infrastructure, he said. But Sundararaman said shortages of critical care specialists could be made up through innovation and technology. “Medical graduates could be provided short-term training in critical care and telemedicine services could help support critical care decisions in rural areas,” he said. The proposed additional health infrastructure also includes five regional National Centres for Disease Control, 20 metropolitan units, and four new National Institutes of Virology, collectively aimed at improving India’s capacity for disease surveillance that many experts believe is currently weak.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-89
26-10-2021||India||Contempt call to SC against govt for stalling judges' appointment||The Advocates’ Association of Bangalore on Monday urged the Supreme Court to initiate contempt proceedings against the Centre for “wilful” defiance by refusing to clear 11 names for appointment as judges to various high courts in spite of the collegium iterating its recommendations. The names include five shortlisted for Calcutta High Court. Among those recommended but not cleared for Calcutta High Court include senior advocate Amitesh Banerjee, son of former Supreme Court judge Justice U.C. Banerjee who headed the one-man commission that had ruled out a conspiracy behind the Godhra train fire that killed 59 kar sevaks, and advocate Sakya Sen, son of former Allahabad High Court chief justice Shyamal Sen. In a writ petition filed through advocate Pai Amit, the association submitted that the wilful defiance of the collegium’s recommendations is in violation of the Supreme Court’s nine-judge bench ruling in 1993, iterated by another nine-judge bench in 1998 and restated by the Supreme Court on April 20 this year. All these rulings had said that once the Supreme Court collegium iterates a name, the Centre has no option but to abide by it. The association also expressed concern over the growing tendency of the Union government to segregate the names of candidates recommended by the collegium, instead of approving them in one instalment. For instance, if six names are recommended for a particular high court by the Supreme Court collegium, the Union government since 2014 has been clearing only three or four names while withholding the remaining names indefinitely. This affects the seniority of the person whose name is not cleared initially along with others by the Centre. A peculiar situation also arises as once a name is recommended, the “recommendee” usually desists from practising in any court. Any delay in clearing the name leaves the “recommendee” in a limbo. Before 2014, the convention had been to clear all the names together. The association said it is “…deeply concerned with the extraordinary delays in the appointment of Judges to the Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka as well as the rest of the Hon’ble High Courts across the country, as well as the segregation of the names by the Alleged Contemnors/Respondents, which is detrimental to the cherished principle of the independence of the judiciary. “It is submitted that by these inordinate delays in the appointment of Judges to the Hon’ble High Courts after the recommendation by the collegium headed by Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India even after reiteration are a direct contravention of earlier judgments,” the petition said. The petitioner has made Barun Mitra, secretary, and Rajinder Kashyap, additional secretary, in the Union law and justice ministry “the alleged contemnors as respondents in the case”. “It is submitted that it is a very dangerous precedent if the Executive confers upon itself the power to implement only those binding recommendations that are to its liking and chooses not to implement the others. It is submitted that the failure to implement the binding decision of the collegium headed by the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India, even upon reiteration, would amount to a wilful disobedience of the orders of the Hon’ble Supreme Court,” the petition said. The association has cited the following cases of alleged defiance by the Union government: The Supreme Court had earlier set the following timelines. According to the petitioner, unreasonable delays are a direct assault on the independence of the judiciary.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-89
26-10-2021||India||NCB vigilance probe after bribe demand allegation against officer||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has ordered a vigilance probe after allegations of a demand for bribe were made against its zonal director Sameer Wankhede by an independent witness in the cruise ship case in which Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan has been arrested. Sources said NCB’s deputy director-general Gyanneshwar Singh, who is also the agency’s chief vigilance officer, has been asked to probe the allegation. In a notarised affidavit, witness Prabhakar Raghoji Sail on Sunday said that shortly after the NCB raid on October 2, he had overheard a conversation about paying Rs 8 crore to Wankhede. Sail said he was the personal bodyguard of another independent witness K.P. Gosavi, whose selfie with Aryan inside the NCB office on the night of the raid had caught attention. In the affidavit, Sail said that after Aryan’s detention, “Gosavi was talking to Sam on the phone and stated that you put a bomb of 25 crores and let’s settle at 18 final because we have to give 8 crores to Sameer Wankhede”. On Monday, Sail met senior Mumbai police officials and sought protection saying he feared for his life. Wankhede, who has been leading the probe in the Aryan case, invoked his secular credentials and protested the “invasion of his family privacy” after his personal documents were published on social media. “I would like to express that my father Sh. Dnyandev Kachruji Wankhede retired as senior police inspector of state excise department, Pune on 30.06.2007. My father is a Hindu and my mother late Mrs. Zaheeda was a Muslim,” Wankhede said. “I belong to a composite, multi religious and secular family in true Indian tradition and I am proud of my heritage. Further, I married Dr. Shabana Qureshi in 2006 in a civil marriage ceremony under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. Both of us divorced mutually through civil court under the Special Marriage Act in the year 2016. Later in the year 2017, I married Shrimati Kranti Dinanath Redkar,” he said. Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik had tweeted a birth certificate that purportedly shows Sameer Wankhede was born as Sameer Dawood Wankhede. The minister also shared a photograph of his nikaah with Shabana Qureshi. Malik implied Wankhede had forged his caste certificate to bag the NCB job under the Scheduled Caste quota.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-89
26-10-2021||India||Archbishop urges Karnataka govt to drop church survey ||Archbishop of Bangalore Peter Machado on Monday urged the Karnataka government to withdraw the directive issued to district authorities and the police intelligence wing to conduct a survey on churches in the state and objected to the proposed anti-conversion law. “I would have had no issues with this had it been for all communities. But it hurts us since you are targeting only Christians,” he told a news conference. The Karnataka Legislative Committee on Backward Classes and Minorities Welfare had recently ordered a dubious survey on churches and the functioning of Christian missionaries ostensibly to keep a tab on their activities in the BJP-ruled state. This came close on the heels of chief minister Basavaraj Bommai repeatedly stressing the need for a “strong” anti-conversion law in the state where Christians form a mere 1.87 per cent of the 6.5 crore population. “We would like to appeal to the government not to go ahead with the anti-conversion bill. It won’t bring credit to Karnataka,” he said. “The foreign corporations that come here could perhaps think that Karnataka is a very limited state and its people have small minds,” he said, citing the implications of such a law. “I am also opposing such a law since it is discriminatory to us…. Everyone knows that Christian schools are very popular in Bangalore. You have the faith to send your child to our schools. Do you think I am going to convert you in your old age?” Machado said rebutting Sangh parivar allegations on rampant proselytisation. “It is arbitrary because it targets only the Christian community. Is conversion happening only in Christian community? If a Hindu converts to Christianity, you call it conversion. But what do you call when a Christian converts to Hinduism? We are just two per cent. Allow us to live in peace,” the archbishop appealed to the government. He noted that such a discriminatory law would be misused by religious fundamentalists. “There will be more and more attacks on our churches, our pastors and our sisters. Already we have seen signs of such things happening in Karnataka,” he said, alluding to the recent surge in attacks against minorities, especially Christians, in the state. “There has been an increase in attacks on churches. Six crosses have been demolished in Bangalore (over several months),” Machado noted, alluding to the cases pending in courts. He recalled how Bommai reacted to a series of attacks against churches and Christian institutions in 2008 when he was with Janata Dal United. “But now 10 or 12 years later, are you going to encourage certain groups to attack us by making laws like this?” The BJP government is likely to use the Uttar Pradesh anti-conversion law as a mould to model its bill. But the archbishop saw a bigger danger in doing so. “The UP law defines any kind of incentive as an allurement (for conversion). By that definition, we might have to stop free education to the poor since that could be construed as an incentive,” he said. He, however, limited his comments on the survey of churches as the matter was now in Karnataka High Court after People’s Union of Civil Liberties moved a petition against the legislative committee’s directive. Machado said the church would ask the Christian community in the state to spend the second Friday of November in prayers and fasting and possibly take out a silent march for their rights enshrined in the Constitution. Congress MLA and former home minister K.J. George, who was among those present at the news conference, said the use of intelligence wing for such a survey was illegal. “I have already said in the Assembly that there are no grounds to use the intelligence department for such a survey,” he said, adding that the Congress would put up a strong opposition against the anti-conversion bill when it is tabled in the House.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-89
