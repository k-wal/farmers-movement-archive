24-10-2021||India||Prakash Jha roughed up, face smeared with ink by Bajrang Dal ||Filmmaker Prakash Jha was roughed up, his face smeared with ink on Sunday when a group of Bajrang Dal members went on a rampage on the set of his web series being shot in Bhopal, the police said. Videos shot by witnesses on cellphones showed Bajrang Dal members chasing down crew members, managing to catch at least one of them and beating him mercilessly with a metal light stand. Members of the right-wing group said Prakash Jha's web series 'Ashram' starring Bobby Deol was an assault on Hinduism and they will not allow its filming till the title was changed. Jha, who has not filed a complaint in the matter yet, has assured that he will change the name of the series, a Bajrang Dal leader said. A mob of Bajrang Dal members attacked the set in the evening, shouting slogans like "Prakash Jha Murdabad", "Bobby Deol Murdabad" and "Jai Shri Ram". "They made Ashram 1, Ashram 2 and were shooting Ashram 3 here. Prakash Jha showed in Ashram that the guru was abusing women. Does he have the guts to make such a film on a church or madrasa? Who does he think he is?" Bajrang Dal leader Sushil Sudeley said. "Bajrang Dal challenges him, we won't let him make this film. So far we have just blackened Prakash Jha's face. We are looking for Bobby Deol. He should learn something from his brother (Sunny Deol). He made such patriotic movies," he added. The police have said that even though no one from Jha's team has pressed charges, those involved will be identified and arrested. "Action will be taken against those who disrupted the shooting and vandalised property today itself. They will be arrested," senior police officer Irshad Wali said. "Anti-social elements ransacked vehicles created trouble. Crew members of Ashram will be given fill security and it will be ensured this does not happen again," he added. 2017, another right-wing group Karni Sena had attacked the sets of the Deepika Padukone starrer Padmaavat, assaulting director Sanjay Leela Bhansali and other crew members and forcing the movie to modify scenes and change its name from Padmaavati. Earlier this year, Amazon had to issue an apology and make changes to its Saif Ali Khan starrer web series Tandav after it faced objections from some Hindu groups and the producers were threatened with arrest by the Uttar Pradesh government.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-91
24-10-2021||India||Witness alleges NCB official demanded pay-off from Shah Rukh Khan; agency denies claim||An independent witness in the cruise drugs seizure case on Sunday claimed that an official of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and some other persons demanded Rs 25 crore from Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan to release his son Aryan Khan in the case.  Prabhakar Sail, a witness in the case, told mediapersons that NCB officials also asked him to sign nine to ten blank papers.  However, a senior NCB official denied the allegations, terming them as "completely false and malicious".  NCB's zonal director Sameer Wankhede earlier this month led the agency's 'drug bust' on a cruise ship following which Aryan Khan was arrested on October 3. He is currently lodged in the Arthur Road jail here.  Recently, the Pune police issued a lookout circular against K P Gosavi, another independent witness of the NCB in the cruise drugs case who used to offer people jobs abroad, in a 2018 cheating case.  On Sunday, Sail alleged that an official of the NCB, Gosavi and another person, named Sam D'Souza, had demanded Rs 25 crore from Shah Rukh Khan to release his son.  Sail, who is the personal bodyguard of Gosavi and accompanied him on the night of the raid, said after Aryan Khan was brought to the NCB office, Gosavi met D'Souza.  Sail claimed he heard Gosavi telling D'Souza over phone about a demand of Rs 25 crore and to settle at Rs 18 crore as they "have to give Rs eight crore to Sameer Wankhede".  The NCB, while stating that Wankhede has categorically denied the allegations, also said that as the matter is sub judice, Sail should have submitted his prayer to the court if he had anything to say.  Mumbai NCB's Deputy Director General (DDG) Mutha Ashok Jain issued a statement saying that he came to know through social media that Sail is a witness in the case.  "As he (Sail) is a witness in the case and the case is before the honourable court and is sub judice, he needs to submit his prayer to the court rather than through social media if he has anything to say," the statement said.  In addition, there are certain vigilance-related allegations against certain persons in the affidavit, which are based on overhearing by Prabhakar Sail, it said.  "Zonal Director of Mumbai NCB Sameer Wankhede has categorically denied these allegations. As some of the contents of the affidavit are related to vigilance matter, we are hereby forwarding the affidavit to the Director General (DG) NCB and requesting him for further necessary action," the statement added.  Meanwhile, Maharashtra minister and NCP spokesman Nawab Malik, who has repeatedly termed the cruise drugs bust case as "fake", said Sail's claims were "very serious" and demanded a probe into it by a Special Investigation Team (SIT).  Talking to reporters in Beed, Malik reiterated his allegation that Wankhede was involved in "extortion and terrorising the Mumbai film industry", and said he will meet the chief minister and home minister on Monday in Mumbai seeking a SIT probe into Sail's claims.  Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut in a tweet said, "Witness in AryanKhan case made to sign on blank paper by NCB is shocking. Also there are reports that there was demnd of huge money. CM UddhavThackeray said that these cases are made to defame Maharashtra. This seems to be coming true. Police should take suo moto cognizance."  Maharashtra Congress spokesman Atul Londhe said Sail's allegation substantiated the party's charge that central agencies were being against the opposition parties. He demanded that the Supreme Court take appropriate action against the misuse of agencies politically.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-91
24-10-2021||India||Nobody will be allowed to disrupt peace and development in J&K: Amit Shah||Asserting that the government is aiming to wipe out terrorism from Jammu and Kashmir and put an end to civilian killings, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday said nobody would be allowed to disrupt peace and development in the union territory, which has a place in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's heart.  He said Rs 12,000 crore worth of investment has already come to the union territory and the government aims at a total of Rs 51,000 crore by the end of 2022 to provide five lakh jobs to the local youth.  Shah is on a three-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir, his first after the Centre revoked the erstwhile state's special status and bifurcated it into two union territories of J&K and Ladakh on August 5, 2019.  Addressing a public rally at Bhagwati Nagar here, Shah without naming the Congress, National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the three families are answerable to the people for their failure to develop Jammu and Kashmir over the past seven decades.  "The new phase of development under the leadership of Modi has started in J&K but attempts are being made by inimical elements to create a hurdle. I have come here to assure you that nobody will be able to create a hurdle and disrupt peace and development," Shah, who arrived at the well-attended rally amid thunderous applause and sloganeering by people, said.  In an apparent reference to the killing of 11 civilians by terrorists in targeted attacks across Kashmir this month, he said some people are raising questions about the prevailing security situation in the UT but "I want to answer them with facts and figures".  "Between 2004 and 2014, a total of 2,081 civilians were killed with average deaths of 239 annually. From 2014 till September this year, 239 civilians unfortunately lost their lives which accounted 30 deaths per year. The figures are down but we are not satisfied," the home minister said, adding We want to build such an atmosphere that not a single person loses his life and the terrorism is wiped out."  He said a new phase of development has started which cannot be stopped by anyone.  "Jammu and Kashmir is placed in the heart of the prime minister and under his government, there will be no injustice, discrimination or appeasement, he said.  Shah said the time for sidelining the people of Jammu has come to an end and now both Kashmir and Jammu will be developed together.  "Jammu has borne the brunt of discrimination for years together. Now there will be no injustice with anyone and both Kashmir and Jammu will be developed together and the developed J&K will strengthen India, he said.  Listing various steps taken by the government since the formation of the BJP government at the Centre, he said five lakh jobs are being created in Jammu and Kashmir, while 25,000 people have been provided government jobs in the past two years through service selection board.  "The three families used to say who will come and invest in J&K.... Till date, we have got an investment of Rs 7,000 crore in Jammu and Rs 5,000 crore in Kashmir. And when we came out with a new industrial policy, the three families who have deprived the people of J&K of various benefits, started raising questions.  "We have had Rs 12,000 crore investment due to the efforts of the prime minister and are looking forward to an investment of Rs 51,000 crore by the end of 2022, he said.  Targeting the three families, he said they were asking what the government is going to give to J&K. "We have a long list of what we have given to J&K and the people know it very well but the people of J&K are demanding an answer from them as to what they have given to J&K despite ruling the erstwhile state for the past seven decades. Have you thought of anyone else other than your own family members.  He said soon after Modi became the prime minister, he released a Rs 55,000-crore financial package, of which Rs 33,000 crore has already been spent on various developmental projects.  "Today I have laid the foundation of various projects worth Rs 15,000 crore. These three families together have not done so much development during their entire rule, he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92
24-10-2021||India||Punjab must focus on real issues, says Sidhu; never saw such anarchy in Punjab Cong, says Tewari||Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu on Sunday said the state must concentrate on real issues that concern every Punjabi even as MP Manish Tewari said he never saw "such chaos and anarchy" being played out in the party's state unit.  Critical of the infighting in the Punjab Congress, Tewari tweeted that party leaders are "squabbling publicly with each other like children", using "guttural language" that "even fish wives would not use".  The statements by both leaders have come amid the ongoing war of words between Congress leaders and former chief minister Amarinder Singh over his friendship with Pakistani journalist Aroosa Alam, just months before the state Assembly polls.  Amarinder was replaced by Charanjit Singh Channi as the state chief minister after a power tussle with Sidhu and had said he will form a new party.  "Punjab must come back to its real issues that concern every Punjabi and our future generations. How will we counter the financial emergency that stares upon us? I will stick to the real issues and not let them take a backseat!,"Sidhu tweeted earlier in the day.  Sidhu said,"The choice is clear between irreparable damage and the last chance for damage control. Who will bring back state's resources to the state's coffers, instead of them going to private pockets? Who will lead the initiative for resurrection our great state to prosperity!!"  "Let the mist clear, reality shine like the sun upon the roadmap for revival of Punjab, shunning those who protect the selfish vested interests and focus only on the path that will lead to Jittega Punjab, Jittegi Punjabiyat and Jittega Har Punjabi," he added in another tweet.  Meanwhile, Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari expressed his dismay over the ongoing developments in the Punjab Congress and asked whether the party thought the people were not disgusted by the "daily soap opera".  He never saw such "chaos and anarchy as what is playing out" in the Punjab Congress, Tewari said, adding that the "guttural language was used against each other that "even fish wives would not use".  In a series of tweets, Tewari also questioned the progress on issues like the 2015 desecration incidents, drug menace and power purchase pacts.  The Anandpur Sahib MP was reacting to his reference by Congress general secretary Harish Rawat in an interview to a media house.  "Since you referred to me in this interview I also have great regard & respect for you going back to days when I headed @nsui & you @CongressSevadal. However in my 40 years plus in @INCIndia I have never seen such chaos & anarchy as what is playing out in @INCPunjab today.  Repeated open defiance of AICC by a PCC President, colleagues squabbling publicly with each other like children. Guttural language against each other that even fish wives would not use. For the past 5 months it is @INCPunjab vs @INCPunjab. Do we think that people of Punjab are not disgusted by this daily soap opera," tweeted Tewari.  Tewari also called the Mallikarjun Kharge-led three-member panel formed by the party earlier to end factionalism in the Punjab Congress as a serious error of judgment .  "Irony is that those who complained loudest of transgressions & aberrations were unfortunately & continue to be worst offenders themselves. History would record that the appointment of the Committee that ostensibly heard perceived & real grievances was a serious error of judgment," he said.  "Where is progress on the issues that agitated these MLA's & other eminences--Bargari,drugs, power PPAs, illegal sand mining. Has there been any movement forward," asked Tewari.  During his meeting with Congress senior leaders K C Venugopal and Harish Rawat in Delhi recently, Sidhu too had raised his concerns over the 18-point agenda taken up by the leadership on which actions are pending.  These included action against those involved in the sacrilege issue and the drugs mafia.  Sidhu had written a letter to party chief Sonia Gandhi on October 15, flagging the issues which the government "must deliver upon" and saying it is the poll-bound state's "last chance for resurrection and redemption".  Sidhu had pitched for a Punjab model with a 13-point agenda to be part of the Congress manifesto for the 2022 Assembly elections.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92
24-10-2021||India||AAP and TMC will be 'marginal players' in 2022 Goa assembly polls, says P Chidambaram||The Aam Aadmi Party and the TMC will be "marginal players" in the Goa assembly polls and the Congress is best positioned to defeat the BJP and form the next government, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said on Sunday.  Chidambaram, who is the Congress' senior election observer for the assembly polls next year, asserted that the Trinamool Congress' entry into Goa "appears to be an imposition from the top that is based in West Bengal" and said he does not know the Mamata Banerjee-led party's motive in trying to start a unit in Goa by "encouraging defections" from other parties.  In an interview with PTI, Chidambaram said any alliance with smaller parties for the Goa assembly polls is only possible if a party accepts that the Congress will be the pivot of the non-BJP formation.  "Goa is one of the five states going to elections early next year. All states are equally important and, in that sense, Goa is important. Congress and the people of Goa have had a long and special bond. Congress understands that Goa, Goans and Goa's way of life are unique," the Rajya Sabha member said.  "We enter the election arena with the intention of winning the election and forming a Congress government in 2022," he said, adding that the party's preparations are "methodical and strong".  Noting that the two major parties in Goa are the Congress and the BJP, Chidambaram said any alliance with smaller parties can only be possible if a party accepts that the Congress will be the pivot of the non-BJP formation.  "I suppose it may be possible to accommodate smaller parties in a few seats if they are so inclined. I cannot speculate about any party," he said.  Asked how he sees the AAP and TMC's Goa election bid, Chidambaram said, "In our assessment, AAP and TMC will be marginal players in the 2022 Goa election."  He said that while AAP tested the waters in 2017 but did not make an impact, TMC entered Goa in September 2021 and there were no local, grassroots workers who sowed the seeds of the party in Goa.  "TMC's entry appears to be an imposition from the top that is based in West Bengal. I do not know the TMC's motive in trying to start a unit in Goa by encouraging defections from other parties," he said.  "As far as the Congress is concerned, we consider the Congress is best positioned to defeat the BJP and form a government. Smaller parties can help if they are so inclined," Chidambaram said.  On whether the Congress will announce a chief ministerial face ahead of polls, he said the time to decide whether the party should name a CM face or not is after it has announced the full list of candidates.  "We will take a decision at the appropriate time," he added.  Asked about former chief minister Luizinho Faleiro quitting the Congress and joining the TMC, Chidambaram said defections have been the bane of Goa politics and the people of state resent defectors more than anything else.  "I was sorry to see Mr Luizinho Faleiro join the band of defectors. The people, especially the voters in his Assembly constituency, resent his defection. Hence, his defection has not dented our worker-base in the constituency.  Congress will field a strong candidate in that Assembly constituency," he said.  Asked whether the party was better prepared for a 2017-like situation when it emerged the single largest party but failed to form the government, Chidambaram said there is "huge anti-incumbency" against the BJP government in Goa and the 2022 elections will not throw up a hung assembly.  "We are confident that the people will give a clear verdict in favour of the Congress. They nearly did in 2017...but we failed to stop defections," he said.  Alleging that the current BJP government in Goa is a "government of defectors", Chidambaram said in 2022, "we will make sure there are no defections from the Congress".  There are ways to ensure there are no defections, and the Congress will live by its promise that there will be no defections from it, he asserted.  The Congress had won the highest 17 seats in the 40-member House in the 2017 Goa Assembly elections, restricting the main opponent BJP to 13. But the saffron party moved to ally with regional parties and came to power under the leadership of Manohar Parrikar, now deceased. The Congress had accused the BJP of "stealing" the mandate, a charge the saffron party rejected.  Over the years, the Congress's strength in the Legislative Assembly dwindled to four after many of its MLAs switched sides and joined the ruling BJP.  The ruling BJP, opposition Congress, Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP, TMC, Shiv Sena and regional parties like the Goa Forward Party (GFP) and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party are all in the poll fray with not much clarity yet on forging of alliances.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92
24-10-2021||India||G-20 summit: Modi expected to pitch for united approach to deal with Afghan crisis||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to pitch for a united global approach in dealing with the situation in Afghanistan and combating challenges of climate change and the coronavirus pandemic at the two-day G-20 Summit in Italy beginning October 30, people familiar with the development said on Sunday.  The prime minister will be travelling to Rome and Glasgow from October 29 to November 2 to attend the 16th G-20 Summit and the World Leaders' Summit of COP-26 respectively, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said.  It said Modi will be participating in the 16th G-20 Summit in Rome from October 30-31 at the invitation of Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. Italy has been holding the presidency of the G-20 since December last year.  The G-20 is a leading global forum that brings together the world's major economies. Its members account for more than 80 per cent of the global GDP, 75 per cent of global trade and 60 per cent of the population of the planet.  The forum has met every year since 1999 and includes, since 2008, a yearly summit, with the participation of the respective heads of state and government.  The MEA said India is scheduled to host the G-20 summit in 2023 for the first time.  The Rome summit will be attended by heads of state and government of G-20 member countries, the European Union, and other invited countries and several international organisations.  The G-20 leaders are expected to deliberate on a number of key challenges such as recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, addressing climate change and overcoming poverty and inequality in various parts of the world.  The situation in Afghanistan is expected to figure prominently at the summit, said one of the people cited above.  Prime Minister Modi is likely to present India's perspective to combat the key challenges facing the globe and is expected to call for a united approach to the situation in Afghanistan as well to deal with the pandemic and climate change, they said.  It will be the eighth G-20 summit Modi would be attending. The G-20 has emerged as the premier global forum for international economic cooperation.  The forthcoming summit will be centred around the theme 'People, Planet, Prosperity', focussing on areas of recovery from the pandemic and strengthening of global health governance.  It will also focus on economic recovery and resilience, climate change and energy transition, and sustainable development and food security, the MEA said in a statement.  The prime minister will also hold several bilateral meetings, including with Draghi.  From Rome, Modi will travel to Glasgow to attend the World Leader's summit of the 26th Conference of Parties (COP-26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the MEA said.  The prime minister is attending the climate summit at the invitation of his British counterpart Boris Johnson.  The COP-26 is being held from October 31 to November 12 under the presidency of the UK which is partnering with Italy for the event.  The MEA said the high-level segment of COP-26, titled the World Leaders' Summit (WLS), will be held on November 1 to 2. The summit will be attended by heads of state and government of more than 120 countries.  "The UNFCCC embodies the global will and vision to combat climate change. The periodic Conference of Parties to this Convention have emerged as global climate summits, providing an opportunity for stocktaking and for charting the way forward," the MEA said.  The prime minister last attended the COP-21 in Paris in 2015, when the Paris Agreement was concluded, and whose implementation commences this year.  "At COP-26, the parties will work to achieve the completion of Paris Agreement implementation guidelines; the mobilisation of climate finance; actions to strengthen climate adaptation, technology development and transfer; and keeping in reach the Paris Agreement goals of limiting the rise in global temperatures," it said.  The MEA said Modi will hold numerous bilateral meetings on the sidelines of COP-26, including with Johnson.  The COP-26 summit is being billed as one of the biggest ever congregations of world leaders and experts in combating climate change.  On Thursday, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, highlighting India's climate action in meeting its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) related to the Paris climate agreement, said that New Delhi intends to go in with a strong message with full commitment to COP26.  "We are perhaps the only G-20 country to have fulfilled our NDCs and outperformed them," Shringla said in a virtual address at the India Global Forum.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92

In his monthly Mann Ki Baat broadcast, Modi hailed healthcare workers for the vaccine milestone and said he knew that they would leave no stone unturned to vaccinate the people of the country.  The success of our vaccination drive shows India's capability and the strength of 'sabka prayas' (collective effort) mantra, he said.  Modi said the country is moving ahead with new energy and enthusiasm after crossing the 100 crore Covid vaccine doses milestone.  On October 21, India achieved a major milestone in its vaccination programme against COVID-19 as the cumulative vaccine doses administered in the country surpassed the 100-crore mark.  In his Mann Ki Baat radio programme, Modi also said India has always worked for world peace and this is seen in the country's contribution to the UN Peacekeeping forces.  India is also working to make Yoga and traditional methods of wellness more popular, he said.  The prime minister also praised the rise in number of women police personnel and noted that it has jumped to over 2.15 lakh from 1.05 lakh in 2014.

Ashish, who was taken in police remand, was sent to the district jail Saturday evening for treatment at its healthcare facility, Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Arun Kumar Singh said.  Ashish, along with three others, was taken in two-day police custody on Friday evening for further interrogation in the case.  Chief Medical Officer of Lakhimpur Kheri, Shailendra Bhatnagar along with his team examined Ashish.  "The samples (of Ashish Mishra) collected Saturday night tested positive for dengue. His sugar levels were found to be critical. Some changes were also observed in the ECG. This demands treatment under observation by expert doctors at the district hospital, he told reporters on Sunday.  Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3 in violence that erupted during a farmers' protest.  Thirteen people, including Mishra, have so far been arrested in connection with the incident.  Three accused arrested on Saturday -- Mohit Trivedi, Rinku Rana and Dharmendra -- were produced before a magistrate. The investigators moved an application for their 14-day police custody remand.

24-10-2021||India||Modi govt created records in 'giving trouble' to people: Priyanka Gandhi slams Centre over rising fuel prices||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday attacked the Centre over rising prices of petrol and diesel, alleging that the Modi government has created records in "giving trouble" to people.  Taking to Twitter, the Congress general secretary tagged a media report which said that this year petrol prices have increased by a record Rs 23.53.  "Modi ji's government has made big records in giving trouble to the public. Highest unemployment: in Modi government. Government properties being sold: in Modi government. Petrol rates increased the most in a year: in Modi government," Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also took a dig at the government by tagging the same media report and tweeting, "Achche Din" (good days).  Petrol and diesel prices were hiked for the fourth consecutive day on Saturday by 35 paise per litre, pushing the total increase in rates on petrol to Rs 36 per litre and on diesel to Rs 26.58 since early May 2020 when taxes on the two fuels were raised to record levels.  Petrol in Delhi now costs Rs 107.24 a litre and diesel comes for Rs 95.97, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92
24-10-2021||India||Government likely to introduce 2 key financial sector bills in winter session||The government may introduce two key financial sector bills, including the proposed law for facilitating privatisation of public sector banks as announced by the finance minister in the Budget.  The government is also likely to table amendments to the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) Act, 2013, to enable separation of the National Pension System Trust (NPS) from the PFRDA for ensuring universal pension coverage.  The government is likely to table amendments in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, during the forthcoming Winter Session of Parliament, sources said.  Apart from this, amendments would be needed in the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970, and the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1980, for privatisation of banks, sources said.  These Acts led to the nationalisation of banks in two phases and provisions of these laws have to be changed for the privatisation of banks, they said.  A month-long winter session of Parliament is expected to start by the end of the next month. The second batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants, allowing the government to undertake additional expenditure other than the Finance Bill, would also be introduced for approval.  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman while presenting the Budget for 2021-22 had announced the privatisation of public sector banks (PSBs) as part of disinvestment drive to garner Rs 1.75 lakh crore.  "Other than IDBI Bank, we propose to take up the privatization of two Public Sector Banks and one General Insurance company in the year 2021-22," she had said.  For ensuring privatisation of a general insurance company, the government has already received approval from Parliament for the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill, 2021, in the monsoon session ended in August 2021.  With the amendment in the PFRDA Act, sources said, powers, functions and duties of NPS Trust, which are currently laid down under PFRDA (National Pension System Trust) Regulations 2015, may come under a charitable Trust or the Companies Act.  The intent behind this is to keep NPS Trust separate from the pension regulator and managed by a competent board of 15 members. Out of this, the majority of members are likely to be from the government as they, including states, are the biggest contributor to the corpus.  The Trust was established by PFRDA for taking care of the assets and funds under NPS. The proposal to separate the two job roles has been under consideration for the last couple of years.  The PFRDA was established for promoting and ensuring the orderly growth of the pension sector with sufficient powers over pension funds, the central record keeping agency and other intermediaries. It also safeguards the interest of members.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92

Last night, stranded persons at Sinthan Pass in south Kashmir district were rescued, they said.  The rescue team of civil, police army and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) officials traversed 30 km through snow-covered and foggy terrain, aided by machinery and walked for 8 km to reach the location, the officials said.  "At 0500 hours on October 24, one body was located on the spot, while another person died during the trip back," they said.  Two people survived and are being treated for hypothermia and shock, the officials added.  Parts of the valley, especially the higher reaches in south Kashmir, received moderate to heavy snowfall on Saturday.  The snowfall and rains, which started late on Friday night, triggered a mudslide that hit a tent set up by nomads in Noorpora in Tral area of Pulwama district, leaving three people, including two women dead, and one critically injured, they said.  The nomads belonged to Reasi district in the Jammu Division, the officials added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92

Heavy firing and explosions were reported from Bhatta Durrian forest of Mendhar which along with nearby forest areas adjoining Surankote (Poonch) and Thanamandi in Rajouri district is witnessing a massive search operation, the officials said.

Detenue Mustafa was taken to Bhatadurian for identification of terrorist hideout during the ongoing operation in which three Army jawans and a JCO were martyred (on October 14).  "During the search when the team approached the hideout, terrorists again opened fire on the joint team of police and Army personnel in which two policemen and an Army jawan sustained injuries, the spokesperson said.  The police said Mustafa also sustained injuries and he could not be taken out from the site due to heavy fire.  Injured personnel are under treatment at the nearby health facility. A fresh attempt will be made with reinforcements (to neutralise terrorists and retrieve the injured Mustafa, the spokesperson said, adding that an operation at the site is still going on.  Officials said Mustafa, a resident of Rawalakot in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, was lodged in Kot Bhalwal jail for the last 14 years and was shifted to Mendhar on police remand after investigation revealed his link with the hiding terrorists.  Mustafa had sneaked into this side from the same route before he was arrested from south Kashmir, the officials said.  The operation in the forest areas in the twin border districts commenced on October 11 when terrorists ambushed a search party killing five soldiers including a Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) in Surankote forest of Poonch before another gunfight in nearby Thanamandi on the same day.  On October 14, the terrorists struck again and killed four soldiers including a JCO in Nar Khas forest in Mendhar as the security forces extended the cordon and search operation to neutralise the fleeing terrorists.  Drones and helicopters were pressed into service to assist the marching troops, which included para-commandos, in the jungle spread over nearly 8 kmX2 km area at a distance of four km from the Line of Control (LoC), the officials said.  Ten persons, including two women, were detained for questioning after it came to light that they allegedly provided logistic support including food and shelter to the terrorists, the officials said.  An Army official said on Saturday that a major part of the forest was cleared and now the search area is restricted to a location housing a number of natural caves.  There was no contact with the terrorist after the initial gunfights on October 11 and October 14. The search area was expanded in search of the terrorists, the official had said, hoping to conclude the operation with the clearance of the natural caves within a day or two depending on the weather conditions.  Traffic between Mendhar and Thanamandi along the Jammu-Rajouri highway remained suspended as a precautionary measure for the ninth day on Sunday in the wake of the ongoing operation.  Rajouri and Poonch in Jammu region have witnessed a rise in infiltration attempts since June this year, resulting in the killing of nine terrorists in separate encounters.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92

24-10-2021||India||CJI Ramana wishes for judicial financial autonomy||Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana on Saturday advocated financial autonomy for the judiciary, and cited research that said the failure to deliver timely justice to people had cost the country financial losses amounting to 9 per cent of its GDP. Courts now depend on the executive for all their fiscal requirements. Justice Ramana regretted that many courts in the country lacked adequate court halls, toilets or seating arrangements, which he said was affecting the justice delivery system. Justice Ramana, who was speaking after inaugurating a new wing at the Aurangabad Bench of Bombay High Court, cited figures to underline the lack of adequate infrastructure at India’s courts: ⚫ The sanctioned strength of judicial officers in the country is 24,280 while the number of functioning court halls is 20,143 (including 620 rented halls). ⚫ Some 26 per cent court complexes lack toilets for women and 16 per cent lack even men’s toilets. ⚫ Only 54 per cent of court complexes receive purified drinking water; just 5 per cent have basic medical facilities; only 51 per cent have a library. ⚫ Only 32 per cent of courtrooms have separate record rooms; just 27 per cent have computers on the judge’s dais with videoconferencing facilities. Justice Ramana said: “A good judicial infrastructure for courts in India has always been an afterthought. It’s because of this mindset that courts in India still operate from dilapidated structures, making it difficult to effectively perform their function.” “An effective judiciary can aid in the effective growth of the economy. According to international research published in 2018, failure to deliver timely justice cost the country as much as 9 per cent of annual GDP,” he said. Cases relating to commercial disputes, land acquisition and compensation are among those that have major financial implications. “Moreover, the impact of an under-supported judiciary is also seen on foreign investments. Without adequate infrastructure we cannot aspire to fill this gap,” Justice Ramana said. “If we want a different outcome from the judicial system, we cannot continue to work in these circumstances. An integral aspect, in this regard, is financial autonomy of the judiciary.” The audience included Supreme Court judges such as Justices U.U. Lalit, D.Y. Chandrachud, B.R. Gavai and A.S. Oka, Bombay High Court Chief Justice Dipankar Dutta, Union law minister Kiren Rijiju, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and several legal luminaries. “Judicial infrastructure is important for improving access to justice and to meet the growing demands of the public, (which) is more aware of its rights and is developing economically, socially and culturally,” Justice Ramana said. “It is baffling to note that the improvement and maintenance of judicial infrastructure is still being carried out in an ad hoc and unplanned manner.” He cited the example of the new wing he had just inaugurated. “The need for an additional court complex at the Aurangabad Bench was identified as early as 2011.... That it has taken more than 10 years for this vision to be implemented is extremely worrisome,” he said. “This is not the fault of any institution or organ of the State but is emblematic of a deeper structural problem that has plagued judicial infrastructure development in our country since Independence. Today’s success should not, therefore, blind us to the issues that exist.” Justice Ramana said he had sent a proposal to the law ministry for the establishment of a National Judicial Infrastructure Authority, and urged the minister to take up the necessary legislative measures during the winter session of Parliament. He said courts were important for any society “governed by the rule of law” and court buildings therefore ensured “the constitutional guarantee of the right to justice”. Justice Ramana said India’s courts had repeatedly upheld the rights and freedoms of individuals when they were at the receiving end of executive excesses, providing an assurance that seekers of justice, however weak, need not worry about the might of the State. “It’s a common notion that only criminals or victims of crime approach the court. People take pride in stating, ‘We have never seen a court building in our lifetime’. But it’s high time that we make efforts to remove the taboo associated with approaching courts for the affirmation of (people’s) rights,” Justice Ramana said. “The common man deals with multiple legal issues during his lifetime. One must never feel hesitant to approach courts. After all, people’s faith in the judiciary is the biggest strength of democracy.” Justice Ramana lauded Maharashtra’s contribution towards an egalitarian society, paying tributes to “the extraordinary Savitribai Phule or the pioneering feminist Jyotirao Phule, or the legendary Dr Ambedkar”.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-93
24-10-2021||India||BJP leader warns UP women not to visit police stations after sunset||A senior BJP leader has warned the women of Uttar Pradesh not to visit police stations after sunset. “Although a woman officer and a (woman) sub-inspector sit (at police stations), you should never go to a police station after 5pm, after it becomes dark,” Baby Rani Maurya, BJP national vice-president and former Uttarakhand governor, said on Friday. “If necessary, you can go the next morning with your brother, husband or father.” Maurya, an Agra-based Dalit politician whose star seems to be rising in state politics, did not mention any incidents. But in July, a minor gang-rape complainant was allegedly slapped and kicked by two policewomen inside a police station in Saharanpur, prompting her to cry out she would “never go to a police station again in this life”. Uttar Pradesh police have repeatedly been accused of ill-treating women. The state police have faced allegations of refusing to register women’s complaints and trying to protect men accused of sex crimes. Women cannot be called to a police station after sunset. If unavoidable, women police personnel will have to be present or the police must be able to justify before a court the summons. Women can go to a police station anytime to file a complaint. But if it is after sundown and a woman fears for her safety, the police are expected to go to her place and record the complaint. “You (women) must write to the district magistrate, the chief minister and the Prime Minister if you face problems. The government has done a lot of work for women and their situation has improved,” Maurya said. Her comments came at a BJP event at the Valmiki (Dalit) Basti in Varanasi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency. A senior BJP leader said Maurya’s comments seemed aimed at proving her credentials as an honest politician who wouldn’t spare even her own party’s government in matters of the public good. Also, Maurya seemed to be trying to deflect blame for the poor governance to the lower rungs, as suggested by her next comment. “Government officers mislead us (politicians). A farmer called me for fertilisers, and I asked officers to look after the matter,” she said. “An officer assured me the farmer would get fertilisers, but later refused to give them to the farmer. This kind of mischief is being played at the lower levels (of officialdom).” There’s speculation within the BJP that Maurya might be given a senior post in the state government if the party wins the Assembly elections, due in March. “She is a woman and a Dalit. She suits the party in Uttar Pradesh. It was with this plan that she was asked last month to resign as governor and brought back to active politics in Uttar Pradesh,” the senior BJP leader, who didn’t want to be named, said. He said Maurya’s comments might help the party politically, for voters appreciate self-criticism. “But what she said in Varanasi also reflects poorly on law and order in the state and highlights the high-handedness of officials under Yogi Adityanath’s rule.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-93
24-10-2021||India||Amit Shah appeals to Kashmir’s youth to weed out terrorism||Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday appealed to Kashmir’s youth to weed out terrorism, saying the government would not be able to do it, and at one point acknowledged that the Centre had indeed imposed a “curfew” in the Valley in 2019 and that it may have “hurt” people. Addressing a gathering of youths in Srinagar on his first visit since Jammu and Kashmir’s special status was revoked, Shah said: “Friends, more than 40,000 people — militants, security forces and civilians — have lost their lives. Do we have to end it (militancy) or not? Is it possible to have terrorism and development at the same time? Can it happen? You tell me. It can never happen. The first condition for development is that there should be peace here.” The home minister added: “Who will weed it (militancy) out? Can the government do it? Na bhai na (No, brother, no). The government can only make an effort. The job of stamping out terrorism has to be done by the 45,000 members of the youth clubs who are standing in front of me. You have to become ambassadors of peace and take the message to all youths of Jammu and Kashmir that this is not the road to take our journey forward. It can never be.” He was referring to the 45,000 youths who are members of various sports and other clubs across Jammu and Kashmir. While some were present at the gathering, many others attended the event online. Shah’s overture to Kashmiris suggests a realisation that the government’s iron-fist policy to curb militancy may not have worked. There has been a spate in violence and civilian killings in the Valley, although one of the stated objectives of the dilution of Article 370 in 2019 had been to counter militancy. The home minister claimed the “curfew” and the “Internet shutdown” imposed in 2019 after the scrapping of the special status was meant to save lives, trying to address the anger over the unprecedented clampdown that lasted months. This is the first time the government has acknowledged a curfew, claiming all along that only restrictions had been in place. “Despite that, if someone is hurt…,” Shah said and put his hand on his chest. If the gesture was seen as a precursor to an apology, it did not come at this venue. He continued: “I want to tell you all that for the long-term good you were given a short pain. Just as for malaria, doctors recommend a bitter medicine. This was that kind of pain which saved your kids.” Shah said some people had cried themselves hoarse after the 2019 clampdown. “At that time (2019) there were attempts to ignite emotions. There was a conspiracy and some foreign powers were also involved. Had we not imposed a curfew, we do not know how many elderly parents would have had to lift the coffins of their children. Who was saved through the imposition of the curfew, can somebody tell me? It’s the Kashmiri youth,” Shah said. The home minister iterated the Centre’s position on the restoration of statehood, saying it would be done only after the delimitation and Assembly elections.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-93
24-10-2021||India||Lalu Prasad set to return to Patna after three years||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president Lalu Prasad is expected to return to Patna on Sunday after a gap of over three years. His wife Rabri Devi and daughter Misa Bharti will accompany him on the flight from Delhi. The imminent arrival at the time of bypolls to two Assembly seats has heated up politics in the state. According to RJD sources, the doctors have granted Lalu permission to travel to Patna and flight tickets have been booked. The RJD chief is suffering from severe diabetes, kidney and heart ailments. He has been mostly under treatment at various hospitals in Ranchi, Mumbai and Delhi after being convicted and incarcerated in the fodder scam cases. He was granted bail in April, but was stuck in Delhi for health reasons. “There is a strong possibility of our party chief coming to Patna in a day or two. Let him come. We will inform you,” Lalu’s confidant, advocate and RJD national general secretary Bhola Yadav told The Telegraph. Bhola added that the possibility of Lalu campaigning for the bypolls to the Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan constituencies was slim but the final decision would be taken after his arrival. “One thing is for sure, Laluji will not opt for digital campaigning in the bypolls. At present, his son and RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav is spearheading the campaign,” Bhola said. The RJD chief’s return is being considered crucial at this juncture for two reasons. The Congress has quit the Opposition Grand Alliance, has fielded candidates for the two seats and has fielded young and dynamic leaders such as Kanhaiya Kumar, Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani to campaign in the bypolls. They are being seen as a threat to Tejashwi. The second reason is that Lalu’s eldest son and Hasanpur MLA Tej Pratap Yadav, in his struggle for power with Tejashwi, is continuously rebelling against the party. Lalu’s presence in Bihar, even if he does not campaign physically in the bypolls, will boost the RJD’s chances in both the seats. Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan were won by chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal United and fell vacant when their representatives passed away earlier this year.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-93
24-10-2021||India||Uttarakhand: Two trekkers missing, bodies of two recovered||The bodies of two more trekkers of an 11-member team that had gone missing in rain-wracked Uttarakhand were recovered on Saturday by ITBP personnel from near the Himachal Pradesh border. They were identified as Richard Mandal, 30, of Calcutta and Upendra Singh, 37, from Purola in Uttarkashi, district disaster management officer Devendra Patwal said. The bodies found near the Lamkhaga pass are being brought to Sangla from where they will be taken to Uttarkashi, district magistrate Mayur Dikshit said. The bodies had been spotted on Friday but could be recovered after rescue operations resumed on Saturday, he added. The bodies of five more trekkers had been brought down on Friday. Two are still missing while two surviving members of the team that was bound for Chitkul via Harsil are under treatment in Harsil and Uttarkashi. The search operation for the missing trekkers has been halted due to bad weather at a height of 12,000ft, DM Dikshit said, adding that it would be resumed as soon as the weather permits. The missing have been identified as Calcutta resident Suken Manjhi, 43, and Purola resident Gyan Chand, 33.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-93
24-10-2021||India||Kerala: Young mother forces govt to act to get back her child||A young mother began a hunger strike outside the Kerala secretariat on Saturday morning seeking help to get back her child, whom she said her parents had forcibly given away for adoption a year ago to protect their “honour” since she was unwed. Anupama S. Chandran, 22, called off her protest after an embarrassed state government — the woman’s parents happen to be CPM leaders — applied to a court to halt what it said was the baby’s still-to-be-completed adoption process. A senior lawyer, however, told The Telegraph that unless the state could prove irregularities in the adoption process, it could be a long legal battle without a known precedent. Anupama, a former member of CPM student arm SFI, had delivered a boy on October 19 last year. She had been in a relationship with Ajith Kumar, a married man and a member of CPM youth wing DYFI. Anupama says her parents — local CPM leaders P.S. Jayachandran and Smitha James — forcibly gave the baby away for adoption through a government channel on October 21 last year. The boy is now in “foster care” — a stage prior to full-fledged adoption — with the would-be adoptive parents, state minister for health and family welfare Veena George told a news conference. Anupama has been living with Ajith since March after he divorced his wife Naziya. After letters to the state government and the CPM brought no results, Anupama launched her pavement protest. Jayachandran claims he had written consent from Anupama to give the baby away for adoption. But the mother denies the document’s legal validity, alleging she was forced to sign some papers under duress before being hospitalised for the delivery. “The baby was taken away on the third day after delivery and I was locked up at home until I managed to escape in March and move in with Ajith,” Anupama said. Her police complaint, lodged on April 19, saw no action till October 18, when an FIR was registered naming her parents, elder sister, brother-in-law and two friends of her father. They have been booked under penal code sections 361 (kidnapping from lawful guardianship), 343 (wrongful confinement), 471 (fraudulently using forged documents) and 34 (common intention). Minister George said her department’s principal secretary had been told to investigate any lapses in the adoption process, and promised punishment if any official had erred. “The state adoption agency filed a petition in a Thiruvananthapuram court this afternoon stating the demands of Anupama and (requesting) that the baby be returned to her,” George told the news conference. She conceded that the legal process could be “arduous”. Advocate K.R. Subhash Chandran said: “If there were any errors or oversight in the adoption process it would not be valid and the court can interfere. In that case it will be easy for the mother to get the baby back. “If not, it will be a purely legal issue. Then the court will have to deal with the matter without any known precedent.” Ajith’s ex-wife, Naziya, has accused Anupama of lying. “She is lying. I have seen her signing the documents,” she told reporters on Saturday in her first public comments on the subject. Anupama dismissed the allegation and said Naziya was not present when she was forced to sign the document. “She is only repeating what my father has been telling everyone.” Over the past couple of days, several leaders of a cornered CPM have come out to express support for Anupama’s cause. “I didn’t get their support when I needed it. Now they are extending support while my parents continue to hold party positions,” Anupama told reporters. “So I find it difficult to trust them. Let the party act against my parents to prove its sincerity.” The Opposition has used the issue to attack the CPM. “The party is taking the law into its own hands. That’s why a CPM leader’s daughter is forced to protest outside the secretariat seeking her own child,” leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan of the Congress said on Saturday morning. “This is a clear example of the way the party and its government has been handling issues related to women’s rights.” CPM politburo member Brinda Karat described the matter as a “tragedy of immense proportions”. “As far as rights and morality are concerned, there is no doubt that what happened is totally wrong and Anupama must get her baby back,” she told reporters in Delhi.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-93
24-10-2021||India||Priyanka promises to waive UP farm loans if Cong voted to power ||Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has pledged to waive all farm loans and halve electricity bills if the Congress is voted to power in Uttar Pradesh next year. Addressing a gathering in Barabanki on Saturday after flagging off the Congress’s Pratigya Yatra, Priyanka also announced that the minimum support prices of wheat, paddy and sugarcane would be raised. “We have taken some pledges for you. We call on women to come forward and contest (the Assembly) elections as we want to reserve 40 per cent tickets for them. We have also decided to give smartphones to Class XII passouts and scooties to girls who become graduates. These are meant to empower them,” the Congress general secretary said. “We will waive the loans of farmers and reduce electricity bills of people by half. Labourers who have been financially affected by the pandemic will be given Rs 25,000 each,” Priyanka added. The minimum support price of paddy and wheat will be raised to Rs 2,500 per quintal and that of sugarcane to Rs 400 per quintal. The current MSP for paddy and wheat range between Rs 1,400 and Rs 1,940 per quintal, depending on the quality of the grain. The sugarcane MSP is Rs 250 per quintal Priyanka promised to regularise the employment of those recruited by the state government on an ad hoc basis, including teachers. She also pledged to generate 20 lakh new government jobs in Uttar Pradesh. The Congress leader said the party would release an election manifesto specifically for women in addition to the general manifesto. The Pratigya Yatra will take three different routes —Barabanki to Bundelkhand, Saharanpur to Mathura and Varanasi to Rae Bareli — from October 23 to November 1 with the slogan “Hum vachan nibhayenge (We will fulfil our pledge)”. Priyanka said the way the Narendra Modi government was “protecting” Ajay Mishra Teni, the Union minister of state for home whose car ran over and killed four farmers and a journalist in Lakhimpur Kheri district on October 3, was proof that the BJP government didn’t treat farmers as humans. Teni’s son Ashis Mishra, who was allegedly in the Thar jeep, was arrested only after the Supreme Court intervened. “The minister’s son brutally killed farmers by crushing them under his vehicle. Initially, the government delayed his arrest and now it doesn’t want to suspend the minister. It is enough proof that the government doesn’t treat farmers as humans,” Priyanka said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-93
24-10-2021||India||Centre asks schools to get children to do gallantry project||The Union government has asked central school boards and state authorities to get schoolchildren to do projects on the country’s gallantry award winners under a month-long “Veer Gatha Project”. An education ministry notification on Wednesday said schoolchildren should, between October 21 and November 21, write poems and essays or do paintings that highlight these heroes’ bravery and sacrifice. Academics welcomed the move, saying that doing projects gave children a better idea of a subject — and influenced their lives and personalities — than just reading up about it from a textbook. School activities and projects on government-prescribed topics have increased in recent years, with national board CBSE having earlier written to schools to have their pupils celebrate Yoga Day, National Integration Day and Swachhata Divas. Some education activists have suggested that big-picture projects — such as “What is swachhata and how we can practise it” — can help the students more by forcing them to exercise their minds. The notification said the Veer Gatha programme “shall be open for all schools in all states and Union Territories as well as all schools affiliated to CBSE”. The defence ministry will arrange, through its field organisations or the three services, one-hour programmes for schoolchildren across the country to create awareness about the gallantry award winners. These can be virtual or face-to-face programmes. Educationist N.K. Ambasht, former chairman of the National Institute of Open Schooling, welcomed the initiative. “Doing a project helps the student understand the concept and reflect on it. It brings in behavioural changes,” Ambasht said. He suggested that schools prescribe projects on all kinds of topics. Prince Gajendra Babu, general secretary of the State Platform for Common Schooling System, a civil society watchdog in Tamil Nadu, agreed that having children do projects is a better way of teaching them about a topic. Babu suggested that the topics for projects be “open-ended”, dealing with ideas rather than merely “glorifying” something. “Having a close-ended topic limits the scope for analysis. School boards should prescribe open-ended topics, whether on contemporary issues or historical ones,” he said. “Students can be asked to write on topics such as the problems facing the country, and suggest solutions.” The CBSE has written to all its affiliated schools to get their students to participate in the Veer Gatha programme.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-93
24-10-2021||India||‘In Bangladesh, we are all equal citizens’||The Bangladesh Awami League, since its inception in the late 1940s, started practising non-communal politics in the subcontinent. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Father of the Nation who led the liberation struggle of Bangladesh, took the initiative to secularise the Awami League and the erstwhile socio-political culture of this land. One of the core principles of Bangabandhu’s liberation struggle was that of secularism and non-communalism. After the independence of Bangladesh, Bangabandhu adopted secularism as one of the four fundamental principles of state policy. After the assassination of the Father of the Nation along with his family members, the extra-constitutional government of General Ziaur Rahman unconstitutionally dismantled the principle of secularism from the constitution and incorporated provisions allowing religious politics in the country, amending Article 38 for their narrow political gains. Subsequently, in line with General Zia’s philosophy, another extra-constitutional regime of General Ershad also continued to bring religion in state affairs for their narrow political gain and to perpetuate their rule. The BNP-Jamat’s two government tenures led by Begum Khaleda Zia carried on the legacies of the extra-constitutional military regimes in terms of supporting communal policies at all levels. During this period, the religious minorities, especially a significant number of the Hindu population, were subjected to oppression and repression. The daughter of the Father of the Nation, Sheikh Hasina, after returning to Bangladesh in May 1981 started to lead a historic movement for restoration of democracy and rule of law in the country. Protection of the rights of the people belonging to the religious minorities was an important feature of her movements. Her movements for establishing fundamental rights continued till she took state power by winning the general election in 1996 and even beyond. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina adopted a zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism and violence against people belonging to religious minorities. “Dhormo jaar jaar, utsob shobar (Religion as per one’s own, but festivals common to all)” is not only a slogan adopted by the Awami League but is also a depiction of religious harmony in Bengali society and culture for hundreds of years. Our government always provides adequate protection during the festivals of religious minorities. This year, about 35,000 Durga Puja mandaps were set up across the country and the festivities went off peacefully except for some undesired and heinous incidents in Cumilla, Chandpur, Noakhali, Feni and Rangpur. The total number of Durga Puja mandaps rose from 30,000 in 2017, which signifies the fact that the government has been adequately providing security and other facilities to them. On October 13, 2021, the first attack at a local temple in Cumilla town was reported, arising out of an unexpected incident that is deemed to be a part of a conspiracy to start communal terrorism. On the directive of the Prime Minister, the government took serious cognisance instantly and started initiating all the necessary actions. The Prime Minister has directed all concerned in the government to take immediate steps to identify and arrest the criminals, bring them to justice and take preventive measures in order to protect the religious minorities, especially the Hindu population. Prime Minister Hasina also ordered to provide adequate compensation speedily to the affected people. The government deployed the Border Guard Bangladesh in 22 districts following tensions over the Cumilla incident. But several incidents of attacks on Hindu temples occurred in the next few days in Chandpur, Noakhali, Feni and Rangpur, the most serious of them in Noakhali. Prime Minister Hasina has urged Awami League leaders and activists to step out and resist the attacks on Hindu mandirs and houses and properties belonging to the religious minorities. Starting with the Cumilla incident till date, 71 criminal cases have been lodged and about 500 people arrested all over the country on charges of communal attacks and violence. More cases are being processed. The police and the other law-enforcing agencies are working hard and conducting operations to arrest the accused. Prime Minister Hasina has dismantled the regime of impunity in Bangladesh and established the rule of law. Her government has responded instantly to every incident of communal violence in the country by way of bringing the criminals to justice, while the other governments had actively indulged to this kind of heinous acts. After the attack on a Buddhist temple in Ramu in 2012, 300 people were arrested within seven days, including the Upazilla chairman of Naikhongchhari, Tofael Ahmed, a Jamat leader who was suspended from his position. The trials of the accused are continuing in the regular criminal courts and the government has been working hard as prosecution to ensure they are punished. In the Nasir Nagar violence of 2016, 53 suspected were arrested and sent to jail within the first two days. The government did not exempt anyone from the prosecution. The trial is going on in the regular courts. Because of the number of courts in comparison with the population, trials in Bangladesh generally take a considerable period of time for disposal. Even the trial of the killers of the Father of the Nation and his family members continued for many years. Prime Minister Hasina has given a stern warning to perpetrators of communal violence. “Nobody will be spared. It does not matter which religion they belong to. They will be hunted down and punished,” she has said. Prime Minister Hasina, who truly believes in secular and non-communal politics, has said: “The Bangladesh Awami League does not use the term minority as a nomenclature for religious minorities in Bangladesh. We all are citizens of Bangladesh standing on equal footing and our constitution, laws of the land and the culture and heritage do not discriminate among our citizens on the grounds of religion, caste, creed, gender, etc.” There is information that some political parties are trying to take recourse to communal terrorism in order to dismantle the current political and economic stability of the country and tarnish the image of Bangladesh before the outside world. It is substantially clear who could be the potential beneficiary. A number of authentic reports indicate a political motive to destabilise the government through the recent communal violence. The reports have clearly indicated that the BNP and its allies and their activists and supporters have actively participated in the communal violence. After the first incident in Cumilla, many BNP leaders, through their social media handles, had instigated or indulged the common people to engage in communal violence. In the past 10 years, the BNP and its allies have used several methods of campaign to try to destabilise the government. Having failed in every method, they have taken recourse to communal violence. Given the sensitivity of the socio-political-cultural ethos of South Asia, playing the communal card was an easy task for them. However, because of the staunch and stringent position of Prime Minister Hasina’s government in dealing with and addressing the issue, the situation is under control. The government has taken effective and adequate measures, both preventive and punitive, for the protection and welfare of the people belonging to religious minorities as well as for rendering justice to the victims and their families. ⚫ The author is the information and research secretary of the Bangladesh Awami League||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-93
24-10-2021||India||Puri temple administration implements dress code for servitors||The Puri Shree Jagannath Temple administration has implemented a dress code for its servitors who have to enter the sanctum sanctorum for performing rituals. All these servitors will be required to wear traditional clothes like dhoti, gamuchha and patta. No one will be allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum of the temple in modern clothing like shirt and trousers. “Earlier, we had servitors with no ritual duties in the sanctum sanctorum entering the area wearing shirts and trousers. This makes a bad impression on the devotees who are unable to differentiate between the public and temple servitors,” said Jitendra Sahu, administrator (rituals) of the temple. He added: “The servitors themselves have been demanding a dress code. This will help identify servitors who will also be conscious about their duties.” Senior servitor Rama Krushna Das Mohapatra told The Telegraph: “Since ages our forefathers have been entering the temple in traditional clothes. But now we are noticing a deviation in the new generation. We have even noticed a few are entering the shrine wearing half-pants and even in jeans. “We have no objection to wearing modern clothes but they should be worn outside the temple. This will help maintain the sanctity of the shrine and devotees coming from far and wide will be able to easily identify servitors. It’s a win-win situation both for the devotees and the servitors.” The temple administration has also decided to implement the dress code for its employees from November 5, the day after Diwali. The Jagannath temple police and other staff who need to enter the sanctum sanctorum and its periphery areas within 10 metres will have to wear traditional clothes. However, the police and other staff are allowed to wear their official uniform in other parts of the temple. The temple is spread over a huge area and there are many small temples within its premises. “The temple police will help the devotees if they need their assistance. There will be cameras keeping an eye on what is happening inside the temple,” an official said. However, the temple administration is yet to take a call on whether they would implement any dress code for devotees entering the shrine. “Though it has been implemented in many temples, including Sabarimala in Kerala, we are yet to take a call on the issue. Before taking any such decision, we will have discussions with various stakeholders, including public servants,” said another official.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-94
