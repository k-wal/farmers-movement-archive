27-07-2021||India||Rakesh Asthana appointed Delhi police commissioner||Rakesh Asthana, a senior IPS officer of Gujarat cadre, was appointed as the Commissioner of Delhi Police on Tuesday. According to a Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) order, Asthana, currently serving as Director General of the Border Security Force (BSF), will join as the Delhi Police Commissioner with immediate effect. The appointment of Asthana to the post came just days before his superannuate on July 31. He will have a tenure of one year. This is one of the very few instances when an IPS officer outside of the AGMUT cadre has been appointed as the Delhi Police chief. Usually, an officer belonging to the Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory (AGMUT) cadre is appointed to the post. Asthana, a 1984-batch IPS officer, had served as the Special Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). During his stint in the CBI, he was engaged in an unsavoury spat with the then CBI Director Alok Verma.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-388
27-07-2021||India||SC seeks Centre's response on uniform standard of healthcare||The Supreme Court Tuesday sought the Centre's response on a plea seeking directions for a uniform standard of healthcare for citizens in line with the Constitution by adopting the provisions of the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010. The plea has also sought directions for operationalising all the provisions of the Act, as well as Clinical Establishment Rules, 2012 in order to ensure affordable and quality healthcare. A bench comprising Chief Justice NV Ramana and Surya Kant issued notice to the government and others on the plea filed by Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, Patients' Rights Campaign and K M Gopakumar. Senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, appearing for the petitioners, argued that the Clinical Establishment Act (CEA) came after several committees' recommendations and National Policy on Health and provided guidelines for determining charges and standard treatment. The plea has sought directions for notification and implementation of the conditions for registration of clinical establishments such as observance of minimum standards, display of rates for procedures and services, compliance with the standard treatment protocol, as provided in Sections 11 and 12 of the CEA read with Rule 9 of the Rules, 2012. The plea has also sought directions that a grievance redressal mechanism be created for the patients at the district, state and national level till the lacunae in the CEA are filled by a suitable legislation. The PIL said the duty to provide healthcare to citizens was put on the government under Article 47 of the Constitution; however, the public healthcare system did not proceed as conceived and treats only 30 per cent of the patients, while the rest are treated by the private sector. The petition contended that the public healthcare system suffers from a lack of public health infrastructure and human resources, non-availability of medicines, lack of public investment and forced dependency on the private sector. The plea submitted that there is an urgent need to develop the public healthcare system in India by providing proper infrastructure and sufficient budget to ensure that the maximum facilities exist in the public domain, not only in normal times but also at the time of emergencies such as COVID-19. Since it will take time and investment to develop the public health infrastructure, there is an urgent need to regulate the private healthcare providers to ensure access to affordable and quality healthcare to citizens, the plea said. "If the provisions of the Clinical Establishments Act 2010 are implemented, which apply both to the public and private sector, it would be possible to control some of the ailments from which the private medical the sector is suffering from and also provides an enabling environment to enjoy the right to health guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution and Article 12 of International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights," the plea said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-388
27-07-2021||India||Day after clashes, Centre summons top Assam, Mizoram officials||The Centre has summoned to New Delhi the chief secretaries and DGPs of Assam and Mizoram for a meeting on Wednesday while the restive inter-state border was calm, a day after armed clashes left six dead and over 50 injured, officials said. Notwithstanding the apparent placidity at the border, leaders from the two sides Tuesday voiced anger over the incident, betraying the brittleness of peace. Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla will chair the meeting to discuss the sudden escalation of violence along the Assam-Mizoram border. The meeting of the chief secretaries and Directors General of Police is expected to work on a peace formula so there is no repeat of such violence, a home ministry official said in New Delhi. The two northeastern states are locked in a battle over their boundaries for decades, often culminating in clashes big and small but none like the one witnessed on Monday. Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, meanwhile, blew hot and cold, saying he will abide by any law enacted by Parliament that forces it to even cede its land to another state but till then it will not allow even an "inch to be encroached". BJP general secretary and Lok Sabha MP from the state Dilip Saikia demanded that Mizoram tender an apology to the people of Assam for the death of its police personnel. "What Mizoram police along with local people did yesterday is condemnable. There was a video showing Mizo people celebrating the killing of Assamese police personnel. I condemn this barbaric attack on Assamese people and police," Saikia told reporters in the national capital and demanded an apology. Mizoram Information and Public Relations Minister Lalruatkima shot right back and claimed CRPF personnel at the border did not restrain armed police personnel and civilians from Assam from intruding into Mizoram despite the tension. "The bloody clashes could have been averted had CRPF personnel prevented Assam police from entering Mizoram territory," Lalruatkima told PTI. Assam chief minister Sarma told reporters in Silchar that his government will move the Supreme Court seeking protection of Innerline Forest Reserve from destruction and encroachment and deploy three commando battalions in Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi districts bordering Mizoram to strengthen security. "It is the responsibility of the Centre to define the boundary and we will abide by it...if tomorrow the Parliament enacts a law by which our land can be given to another state, we will do so but till then we will protect our constitutional boundary," he said after paying floral tributes to the slain personnel. Assam has declared a three-day state mourning after the incident. "The dispute is not regarding land but encroachment of reserved forests is the issue. We have no settlements in the forest areas and, if Mizoram can give evidence, we will immediately carry out eviction," he said. "People have sacrificed their lives but boundary has been protected which we will continue to do at any cost. There is very strong deployment of police inside our border and not an inch of land will be allowed to be encroached," he asserted. Responding to a question about whether there could be a foreign angle to the border flare-up, he said, his government had taken decisions in the last two months which might have angered "certain non-state vested actors". He claimed some people who entered India from Myanmar wanted to settle in Assam's Dima Hasao district via Mizoram but his government thwarted the attempts. "Then we hit the drug route through Mizoram and Manipur to Assam," he said. "Finally, the tabling of the Assam Cattle Protection Bill in the state assembly also created apprehension though we have clarified that transporation to northeastern states will not be affected provided they have valid permit," he added, while explaining the reasons that could have upset the non- state actors. When asked if the problem could have been resolved as constituents of NEDA, the northeastern version of the NDA, were ruling the two states, Sarma shot back, saying, "This is not a political issue but a long-standing boundary dispute. Earlier, there were Congress governments in both the states. Was the problem resolved then?" Assam's Barak Valley districts of Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi share a 164-km border with Mizoram's three districts of Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit. Tensions along the border with Mizoram in Cachar and Hailakandi districts of Assam have been escalating since October 2020 with frequent incidents of burning of houses and charges of encroachment of land by both sides. On October 22, 2020, high-level talks were held under the aegis of the Union Home Ministry where it was decided to maintain the status quo and resolve the dispute through discussions. Tensions flared up again in February this year and since then hundreds of people have fled their homes near Gallacherra border outpost after two huts were burnt down, an Aizawl report said. After a lull of few months, a grenade was hurled on an Assam government team visiting the border by unknown attackers from Mizoram on July 10, while two back-to-back explosions were heard from across the border in the wee hours on July 11. Mizoram was a district of Assam before it was carved out as a union territory in 1971 after years of insurgency and the district borders did not really matter. It became a state in 1987 and border issues cropped up as perceptions over where the boundary should be differed. While Mizoram wants it to be along the inner line notified in 1875, which Mizo tribals feel is part of their historical homeland, Assam insists it should be defined according to district demarcation done much later. In an unrelated development but which could give an insight into the Centre's approach to border row among states, the government told the Lok Sabha on Monday that such disputes can "only" be resolved with the cooperation of states involved and the Union government just acts as a facilitator. "The approach of the central government has consistently been that inter-state disputes can be resolved only with the cooperation of the state governments concerned and that the central government acts only as a facilitator for amicable settlement of the dispute in the spirit of mutual understanding," Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai said. Assam is engaged in protracted border disputes with Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Meghalaya and Mizoram. The Union home ministry, meanwhile, said the Centre is in regular touch with the Assam and Mizoram governments and trying to calm down the situation. CRPF contingents have been deployed in the violence-hit area.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-388
27-07-2021||India||Lok Sabha witnesses repeated adjournments amid opposition protests over Pegasus, farm laws||Lok Sabha on Tuesday witnessed a series of brief adjournments amid uproar created by opposition members over various issues, including the Pegasus spying controversy and the three contentious farm laws. While no legislative business could be transacted, the House for the first time in the Monsoon session took up "matters of urgent public importance" wherein MPs raise issues relating to their respective constituencies. Soon after the House assembled for the day, Speaker Om Birla repeatedly urged the protesting members to go back to their seats. “Do not compete with each other in sloganeering. Compete with each other to raise people's issues,” he said. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar took a swipe at the protesting opposition members and said if they are concerned about farmers, they should allow the proceedings of the House to continue. He made the remarks while replying to a supplementary query related to an insurance scheme for farmers during the Question Hour as the opposition members continued with their sloganeering on various issues, including the Pegasus spying controversy and the agriculture laws against which a section of farmers has been protesting on Delhi's borders for eight months. “There are around 15 questions related to farmers. If the opposition members are really concerned about farmers, they should listen to what the government has to say,” Tomar said. “Disruptions are lowering the decorum of the House,” he said. After being adjourned nine times, the lower house reassembled at 4.30 PM and Rajendra Agrawal, who was in the Chair, once again took up one matter of urgent public importance. However, the opposition members again trooped into the well shouting slogans and carrying banners. The members of the Congress, CPI, CPI(M) and the TMC were protesting over the Pegasus snooping row, while the BSP, SP and the Shiromani Akali Dal were raising slogans against the Centre's three farm laws. Agrawal urged the protesting members to go back to their respective seats. “We are requesting you to please cooperate and participate in the proceedings,” he said. With opposition members not willing to relent, Agrawal adjourned the House for the day. Earlier, Speaker Om Birla led the members in paying tributes to Anerood Jugnauth, former president of Mauritius, and Kenneth David Buchizya Kaunda, the first president of Zambia. The opposition's protests started soon after the proceedings began at 11 am. Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal said by disrupting the proceedings, the opposition is not allowing the ministers to do their duty of replying to questions. As the protests continued, the House was adjourned for the first time till 11.45 am. When the House met again, the protests continued, leading to another adjournment till 12 noon. As Lok Sabha reassembled at 12 noon, Agrawal, who was chairing the proceedings, asked the protesting members to discuss their issues and said the government is ready to answer their questions. As the protests continued, Agrawal adjourned the House till 12.30 PM and later till 2 pm. Subsequently, Bhartruhari Mahtab, who was in the Chair, had to repeatedly adjourn the House due to continuing protests.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-388
27-07-2021||India||Unity of opposition parties will take shape on its own: Mamata||Trinamool Congress leader and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday said the unity of opposition parties will take shape on its own, sidestepping questions of her taking on the leadership role. Banerjee, who is in the national capital for the first time after her party's resounding victory in the assembly polls, met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and described it as part of protocol. "I had asked for an appointment from the PM... This was a courtesy visit. Post election, following the protocol we have to meet the PM once. But I also spoke about the Covid situation. I asked him to ensure that West Bengal gets enough vaccine doses. I am not against giving vaccines to other states, but considering the population of Bengal, we need more doses," she told reporters after the meeting. She said during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Bengal in May, there was no scope for a one-to-one meeting. Banerjee also said that she mentioned the issue of the change in West Bengal's name and told him that it was a long pending issue that should be resolved. While Banerjee refused to say if she discussed the Pegasus project with Modi, said that the prime minister should convene an all-party meet on the snooping row and decide on a Supreme Court-led probe. When asked if she has lined up a series of meetings with the Opposition parties with the 2024 Lok Sabha polls in mind, she said that the general elections are far away. "However planning for it has to be done in advance. Like there is election in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Tripura. Like how happened in Tripura with our boys and the issue of Dainik Jagran," she said. Asked about her efforts to unite the Opposition leaders, she said that it will happen "automatically". "Opposition unity will happen naturally, automatically," she said. On whether she will lead the Opposition against the BJP, she said, "The country will lead the Opposition, we are the followers." She said that she will meet all Opposition members after the Parliament session is over and the coronavirus situation normalises, indicating that another visit soon was on the anvil. This time around, however, she has her itinerary set with meetings with opposition party leaders who are seeking time from her and those like Congress Chairperson Sonia Gandhi who has invited her for tea. "She has called me for a chai per charcha tomorrow. Many of these leaders are my old friends. We discuss about old and new times. I will meet Arvind Kejriwal day after tomorrow. Javed Akhtar and Shabana Azmi asked for time, I have given them time. I will meet my party MPs tomorrow. I met Congress leaders Kamal Nath, Anand Sharma and Abhishek Manu Singhvi today," she said. A name missing from her list was that of NCP chief Sharad Pawar. "I haven't spoken to Sharad Pawar. I will meet him after the monsoon session," she said. She also said that she wants to meet the President but she has been informed that she needs to get a RT PCR test done, which, according to her, is difficult to do.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-388
27-07-2021||India||BS Yediyurappa had resigned on July 10, Narendra Modi had his letter, say sources||Though BS Yediyurappa kept alive the suspense surrounding his exit until his tearful announcement on Monday, he had resigned as Karnataka chief minister weeks back, sources told NDTV. According to sources, Yediyurappa resigned on July 10. A senior leader close to him delivered the resignation letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi the same day. Six days later, when Yediyurappa took a chartered flight to Delhi to meet with PM Modi and others in the BJP leadership, there was a strong buzz that he was about to resign. According to NDTV reports, he had offered to quit citing his poor health during his meeting with the prime minister. But Yediyurappa hedged and shut down all talk of his exit, telling reporters: “Not at all, not at all, not at all. There is no truth in it.” But sources say at that meeting, Yediyurappa, 78, told the prime minister he wanted some more time to step down. He reportedly said he wanted to unfurl the national flag on Independence Day August 15 as his last act as Chief Minister. That would mean nearly another month's grace period. He met with BJP chief JP Nadda and Home Minister Amit Shah too. After each meeting, he said he had been told that the party has immense faith in him and wanted him to strengthen the party in Karnataka. After that day, Yediyurappa kept saying he had heard nothing from his party and that he would resign the moment he was asked to. Sources told NDTV that it appeared to be an attempt to project uncertainty over his exit and doubts in the party over whether to let him go. The apparent fluidity also helped build the perception that the BJP was finding it hard to find a replacement for the four-term chief minister and powerful Lingayat leader. In all this speculation, Yediyurappa kept a busy schedule and met with religious heads, including Lingayat seers, in an apparent message to his party leadership in Delhi on the strong support he enjoys. The Lingayats are a powerful community with a huge electoral impact in Karnataka, a fact that fortified Yediyurappa for long from dissenters and even from corruption allegations. Finally, Yediyurappa could stall no more as his government's two-year anniversary arrived. He told reporters on Sunday evening that he had heard “nothing till now” from the BJP but hinted heavily that come Monday, he may not remain in the post. “Nothing has come till now... In the morning there is a programme to mark two years of government. I will speak about the achievements in those two years. After that, you will know the progress,” he said. “I have decided that I will work till the very last minute. I already said two months ago that I was ready to resign whenever I was asked to. I will say it again - until now I have got no message from the centre. As soon as it comes, if they ask me to continue I will. If not, I will resign and work for that party,” he added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-388
27-07-2021||India||Basavaraj Bommai elected as new Karnataka chief minister||The Karnataka BJP legislature party on Tuesday elected Basavaraj Bommai as its new leader and he will succeed outgoing Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa. According to party sources, Bommai, a Lingayat leader from North Karnataka, had the backing of the outgoing chief minister Yeddyurappa to succeed him. Basavaraj Bommai is the son of former chief minister, the late S R Bommai. The 61-year-old leader was Minister for Home Affairs, Law, Parliamentary Affairs and Legislature in Yediyurappa's council of ministers which was dissolved on Monday. "The new leader proposal was made by senior leader B S Yediyurappa and was supported by Govind Karjol, R Ashok, K S Eshwarappa, B Sriramulu, S T Somashekar, Poornima Srinivas, and the newly elected legislature party leader and new Chief Minister will be Basavaraj Bommai," BJP's central observers and Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan said after the meeting. Soon after the announcement, Bommai sought the blessings of Yediyurappa, and he was greeted by other party leaders. The legislature party meeting to elect the new leader took place at a city hotel in the presence of Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and G Kishan Reddy who were appointed as central observers by BJP's parliamentary board. It was attended by BJP national general secretary in-charge of Karnataka Arun Singh, state president Nalin Kumar Kateel, national general secretary C T Ravi, among others. Known for his "clean and non-controversial" image, Bommai is considered among the close confidants of Yediyurappa. Ending months of speculation over his exit, Yediyurappa on Monday stepped down as the Chief Minister, coinciding with his government completing two years in office. Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot accepted the 78-year-old BJP veteran's resignation, and dissolved the Council of Ministers headed by him, with immediate effect. The notification from the Raj Bhavan said Yediyurappa shall continue to function as Chief Minister till alternative arrangements are made.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-388
27-07-2021||India||US Secretary of state arrives in India for two-day visit||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in India on Tuesday on a two-day visit aimed at further boosting bilateral ties and deliberate on the rapidly evolving security situation in Afghanistan as well as to expand cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region under the framework of Quad. On Wednesday, Blinken will hold extensive talks with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and meet National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. He is also scheduled to call on Prime Minister Narendra Modi before leaving for Kuwait as part of his two-nation tour. Just before leaving for India, Blinken said he was looking forward to consultations with partners of the US for further cooperation in support of its shared interests in the Indo-Pacific and Middle East. "Wheels up for my trip to New Delhi and Kuwait City. I look forward to consultations with our partners to further cooperation in support of our shared interests in the Indo-Pacific and Middle East," he tweeted. This is Blinken's first visit to India after assuming charge as the US Secretary of State and the third by a high-ranking Biden administration official after it came to power in January. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin visited India in March while US Special Envoy on Climate Change John Kerry travelled to New Delhi in April. "Secretary Blinken's visit is an opportunity to continue the high-level bilateral dialogue and bolster the India-US global strategic partnership," the Ministry of External Affairs said last week while announcing the visit. "Both sides will review the robust and multifaceted India-US bilateral relations, and potential for consolidating them further," it said. Acting Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Dean Thompson said on Friday that the discussions will focus on expanding ties in areas of security, defence, cyber, and counterterrorism cooperation. "We collaborate across the government on these issues, including through regular US-India working group meetings, and we look forward to further strengthening our ties with India to ensure a safer and more secure world," he said. People familiar with the agenda of the visit said both sides will extensively deliberate on the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan with the Taliban increasing its hostilities in an attempt to seize control of new areas in the country. Afghanistan witnessed a series of terror attacks in the last few weeks as the US withdrew the majority of its troops and is looking at completing the drawdown by August 31, ending nearly two-decade of its military presence in the country. The two sides are also expected to explore ways to deepen defence collaboration, including exercises, defence transfers and technologies ahead of the next edition of the 2+2 defence and foreign ministerial dialogue to be held in the US later this year, those familiar with the development said. Both sides will also discuss ways to deepening engagement in the Indo-Pacific region as well as in enhancing Covid response efforts. The two sides are also expected to look at implementing the Quad vaccine initiative. They are also expected to focus on ways to augment trade and investment ties besides looking at opportunities in healthcare, education, digital domains, the people cited above said. In the talks, India will continue to push for ensuring open and consistent supply chains for materials and items required for vaccine production, the people cited above said. Boosting defence and strategic ties is expected to also figure in the talks.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-388
27-07-2021||India||Seven Opposition parties write to PM, seek intervention on Pegasus row||Seven Opposition parties have written to President Ram Nath Kovind seeking his intervention to direct the government to discuss farmers' issues and Pegasus phone-tapping in Parliament, NCP leader Supriya Sule said on Tuesday. The BSP, RLP, SAD, National Conference, CPI and the CPI(M), besides the NCP, are the signatories to the letter. SAD leader Harsimrat Badal said it is very unfortunate that farmers have died while protesting against the three farm laws but the Centre is not even ready to discuss their issues. NCP leader Sule said the seven parties have written to the President seeking his intervention to instruct the government to discuss the farmers' issues and Pegasus snooping in the Parliament. Shashi Tharoor promises action Parliamentary panel on Information Technology will question government officials on the issue, the committee chairman and senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said on Tuesday asserting that it is the "most important issue" for many members. The 32-member Parliamentary Standing Committee on IT is scheduled to meet on Wednesday, for which the listed agenda is ''Citizens' data security and privacy'', according to a notification issued by Lok Sabha Secretariat. The panel, which has the maximum members from the ruling BJP, has summoned officials from the Ministry of Electronics, Information and Technology and the Ministry of Home Affairs. An international media consortium has reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on a list of potential targets for surveillance using Israeli firm NSO's Pegasus spyware. Opposition leaders including Rahul Gandhi, two union ministers -- Prahlad Singh Patel and Railways and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, businessman Anil Ambani, a former CBI chief, and at least 40 journalists are on the list on the leaked database of NSO. It is, however, not established that all the phones were hacked. "The subject of Citizens Data Privacy and Security is an approved agenda item of the committee and it was under this item that we had earlier discussed the Pegasus issue in November-December last year. So it's a continuing issue. There would be other questions as well, as this is not necessarily the only issue. But, for many of us in the committee this is perhaps the most important issue," Tharoor told PTI a day before the panel's meeting. Since the beginning of the monsoon session on July 19, both houses have seen repeated disruptions as opposition parties have been demanding a Supreme Court-monitored judicial probe in this matter. "Parliament is not functioning because of this issue. People are anxious to find out about this and we are definitely likely to have questions for the government officials attending the meeting.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-388

M V Ramana, CEO of Branded Markets (India and Emerging Markets), Dr Reddys, said due to the sudden spike of Covid-19 cases in Russia, the arrival of Sputnik V doses is getting delayed and the situation may ease by August end. "The local manufacturers are currently in the process of Technology absorption and scale up. “And we expect and from the October-September timeframe we are likely to have locally manufactured Sputnik available," Ramana told reporters. Dr Reddy's, which has tied up with Russian Direct Investment Fund for Sputnik V in India, soft launched the vaccine in India in May 2021 after receiving Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in April 2021. Ramana said the company is in discussions with RDIF for ramping up supplies. RDIF has tied up with six Indian drug makers to manufacture Sputnik V. Dr Reddy's is in a pact with Russian Direct Investment Fund to sell the first 125 million people doses (250 million vials) of COVID-19 vaccineSputnikVin India. The official said the vaccine was launched in 80 cities and over 2.5 lakh people have been administered the jab. Replying to a query, he said the trials of Sputnik V in adolescents have commenced in Russia and they are expected to be completed by October. On the arrival of more Sputnik V stock from RDIF, Ramana said "What we wait for now is the balance of the second dose and we are in discussions with RDIF. We do expect to hear back from them by the end of July. The indications are that in the month of August we should start seeing a bit of floor of the imported product." Meanwhile, Dr Reddy's, in a press release, said SVAAS Wellness Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the drug maker, tied up with ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Limited for a pilot launch of a first-of-its-kind cashless outpatient offering in India. The partnership marks the launch of Dr.Reddys digital health solution 'SVAAS' and demonstrates ICICI Lombards deeper foray into the wellness space.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-389
27-07-2021||India||There has been a slowdown in rate of decline of Covid-19 cases, says Centre||In the past few weeks, there has been a slowdown in the rate of decline of average daily Covid cases, which is a cause of concern, the Union health ministry said on Tuesday. It also said that there are 54 districts in 12 states and Union Territories, which reported over 10 per cent Covid positivity rate for the week ending July 26. "The average daily new cases declined from 3,87,029 cases between May 5-11 to 38,090 cases between July 21- 27. In the past few weeks, there has been a slowdown/reduction in the rate of decline, which remains an area of concern," joint secretary in the health ministry, Lav Agarwal, said. Twenty-two districts in seven states have reported an increasing trend in daily Covid cases for the last four weeks and this is also a cause of concern, the ministry said. There are also eight districts, which were witnessing a decline in positivity rate, but are now seeing a rise in Covid cases, it said, adding that "we cannot take the situation for granted". A study by the Armed Forces Medical College looked at 15 lakh doctors and frontline workers and found that Covishield gives 93 per cent protection while there was 98 per cent mortality reduction, the government said India recorded less than 30,000 fresh Covid-19 cases after 132 days while its active caseload fell below 4,00,000 after 124 days on Tuesday, according to health ministry data.

Superintendent of Police, Baghpat, Abhishek Singh said 10 policemen of Binauli police station have been relieved of their duties and attached to police lines. Akshay, a son of a local RSS leader, had taken his mother (62) to a vaccination centre to get her vaccinated against COVID-19 on Monday. He wanted to get her the jab first instead of standing in queue, citing her age. This led to an altercation with police, his family members said. A policeman allegedly slapped Akshay and got into a scuffle, they said. The vaccination camp was organised by the Health Department in a primary school in Ranchhad village. Later, policemen raided Akshay's house and broke chairs and a window of the car and also vandalised a tractor, the family said. When the women of the house protested, they were insulted. Akshay's mother Madhu, her sister-in-law Kamlesh and one Dharamveer Singh of the village were taken into custody and brought to the police station. A case was filed against Akshay, they alleged. Upset over this, Akshay allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself, the family said. After the news of the suicide reached the villagers, they held a demonstration demanding that a case be lodged against policemen. It was only after senior police officials pacified them that they allowed police to take the body for post-mortem at around 7.30 am on Tuesday. On the complaint of Akshay's father, a case was filed against five policemen, including police station in-charge Chandrakant Pandey, SSI Udham Singh Talan, constable Ashwani, head constable Salim and constable Murli, under section 306 (abetment of suicide) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, police said. SP Singh said Akshay had assaulted the police personnel due to which there was chaos in the camp. A report was filed against Akshay at the Binauli police station for obstructing government work as well as for assault. Later, he ended his life by suicide, the SP said. On the basis of the complaint given by the family members at Binauli police station, an FIR was lodged and 10 policemen were attached to police lines with immediate effect, he said. The investigation into the incident is underway, the SP said. Policemen in large numbers have been deployed in the village to maintain law and order. In a similar incident, five people, including a doctor, were injured when a clash broke out between two groups over Covid-19 vaccination in the Sukhpura area of Ballia district on Monday, according to police.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-389

27-07-2021||India|| Children to get Covid-19 jabs from August, says health minister||Vaccination for children against Covid-19 is expected to kick off in August, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday informed the Parliamentary meeting of the BJP chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, according to news agency ANI. "In BJP Parliamentary Party meeting today, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said that the government would likely start vaccinating children next month for Covid-19. He also said that India is soon going to be the largest vaccine producing country as more companies will get production licences," tweeted ANI. "We would likely begin vaccinating children from next month," the health minister reportedly said during the meeting," Mandaviya was quoted as saying by Hindustan Times. As of now, every citizen in India above the age of 18 is being inoculated with the Covid-19 vaccine. Mandaviya's statement comes amid increasing concerns regarding a third wave of the pandemic, which is likely to affect more children according to experts. The lack of vaccines for kids is increasing worries among citizens. Days ago, AIIMS chief Dr Randeep Guleria said that children are likely to get their vaccines by September, explaining that it will be a significant move to break the chain of Covid-19 transmission. "I think Zydus has already done the trials and they're waiting for the emergency authorisation. The Bharat Biotech's Covaxin trials should be over by August or September, and by that time we should get approval. Pfizer vaccine has been already approved by the FDA (US regulator - Food and Drug Administration)," Guleria told ndtv.com. The European Medicines Agency has already recommended authorising Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine for children aged 12 to 17, the first time the shot has been authorized for people under 18. In May, the US had authorised the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for children aged 12 to 15 years old. The total number of Covid vaccine doses administered so far as part of the nationwide vaccination drive has reached 44.19 crore, the Union health ministry said in its daily bulletin on Tuesday. A total of 45.7 crore doses have been supplied to the states and Union territories from January till date and an additional 6.03 crore doses are expected to be supplied by July 31. This will amount to a total of 51.73 crore doses supplied from January to July 31, the health ministry said in another statement. India recorded less than 30,000 fresh Covid-19 cases after 132 days while its active caseload fell below 4,00,000 after 124 days on Tuesday, according to Union health ministry data. As many as 29,689 new coronavirus infections took the country's tally of Covid-19 cases to 3,14,40,951 while 415 fresh fatalities pushed the death toll to 4,21,382, the data updated at 8 am showed.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-389

He was replying to a question from Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi on whether the government had missed the deadline to frame and notify CAA rules and the steps taken in this context. “The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) has been notified on 12.12.2019 and has come into force w.e.f. 10.01.2020,” the minister said. “The Committees on Subordinate Legislation, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have been requested to grant further extension of time upto 09.01.2022 to frame the rules under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019,” Rai said. The CAA envisages to grant Indian nationality to persecuted non-Muslim minorities of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. This is the fifth extension sought by the government for framing of these rules. According to the Manual on Parliamentary Work, the rules for any legislation should have been framed within six months of presidential assent or seek extension. The objective of the CAA is to grant Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities like Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis and Christians from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Those from these communities who had come to India till December 31, 2014, facing religious persecution there, will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship. After the CAA was passed by Parliament, widespread protests were witnessed in different parts of the country leading to deaths of nearly 100 people in police firing and related violence.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-389

27-07-2021||India||Centre trashes reports claiming India will fail to meet July vaccine target||The government on Tuesday dismissed media reports that claimed that India will miss the end-July target of administering 50 crore Covid vaccine doses as "ill-informed and misrepresenting" and asserted that over 51.60 crore vaccine doses will be supplied from January to July 31. The health ministry issued a statement referring to recent media reports alleging that the country will miss the target of administering half-a-billion (50 crore) doses of the COVID-19 vaccine by July-end, while pointing out that the government had stated in May that it would make 516 million (51.60 crore) vaccine shots available by the end of this month. "These reports are ill-informed and have clearly misrepresented the facts," the statement said. The figures of 516 million vaccine doses might have been picked up from various sources which informed about the likely availability of the vaccine doses from January to July-end, it added. "The facts are that a total of more than 516 million vaccine doses will indeed be supplied from January 2021 to 31st July, 2021," the ministry said. It added that the vaccine doses are supplied to the states in accordance with the advance allocation plan and they are informed about it in advance. The vaccines are supplied to the states in various schedules throughout the month. "Therefore, availability of 516 million doses till end of a particular month does not mean that every dose supplied till that month is going to be consumed/administered. "There would be supplies in pipeline, which should be available for next few days till the next supplies of vaccine doses materialise in a particular state/district/sub-district to keep vaccination going on," the statement said. A total of 45.7 crore doses have been supplied to the states and Union territories from January till date and an additional 6.03 crore doses are expected to be supplied by July 31. This will amount to a total of 51.73 crore doses supplied from January to July 31, it added. "It should be appreciated that India has crossed the landmark of 440 million (44.19 crore) doses administered, which is the largest number achieved in the world and has been done at quite a brisk pace too. Out of these, 9.6 crore are cases where both the doses have been administered," the statement said. A total of 11.97 crore Covid vaccine doses were administered in June. For the month of July (as on July 26), a total of 10.62 crore doses have been administered. It is the endeavour of the government to provide vaccination to the eligible citizens in the shortest possible time according to the availability of the vaccines, the statement said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-389

27-07-2021||India||Border disputes can only be resolved with state govts' cooperation, says Centre||Inter-state border disputes can "only" be resolved with the cooperation of state governments involved in the matter and the Centre just acts as a facilitator in such cases, the Union government informed Parliament on Tuesday. Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai said this in a written statement to the Lok Sabha in response to a question on the role of the Union government in redressing border disputes between states in the country. "The approach of the central government has consistently been that inter-state disputes can be resolved only with the cooperation of the state governments concerned and that the central government acts only as a facilitator for amicable settlement of the dispute in the spirit of mutual understanding," Rai said. He cited at least seven such disputes in the country with Assam being involved in four. According to available information, there are boundary disputes arising out of demarcation of boundaries and claims and counter-claims over territories between Haryana-Himachal Pradesh, Union Territory of Ladakh-Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra-Karnataka, Assam-Arunachal Pradesh, Assam-Nagaland, Assam-Meghalaya and Assam-Mizoram, he said. "Occasional protests and incidents of violence are reported from some of the disputed areas," the minister said. On Monday, at least five Assam Police personnel were killed while defending the "constitutional boundary" of the state with Mizoram as the festering border dispute between the two northeastern states erupted into a bloody conflict, officials said. Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had earlier claimed six police personnel were killed in action during the clashes. An Assam government statement revised the figure just before midnight and said that five state police personnel died and more than 50 people of the force were injured.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-390
27-07-2021||India||Senior journalists move Supreme Court, seek independent probe on Pegasus row||Veteran journalists N Ram and Sashi Kumar have moved the Supreme Court seeking an independent probe by its sitting or retired judge into the reports of alleged snooping by government agencies on eminent citizens, politicians and scribes by using Israeli spyware Pegasus. The petition, likely to come up for hearing within next few days, sought to investigate if the illegal hacking into the phones using the Pegasus spyware represented an attempt by agencies and organisations to muzzle and chill the exercise of free speech and expression of dissent in India. It also sought a direction to the Centre to disclose if the government or any of its agencies obtained license for Pegasus spyware and used it, either directly or indirectly, to conduct surveillance in any manner. The petitioners claimed that investigation involving several leading publications around the world has revealed that more than 142 Indians, including journalists, lawyers, government ministers, opposition politicians, constitutional functionaries and civil society activists, have been identified as potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus software. It climaxed that the forensic analysis of several mobile phones belonging to persons targeted for surveillance by the Security Lab of Amnesty International have confirmed Pegasus-induced security breaches. The targeted surveillance using military-grade spyware is an unacceptable violation of the right to privacy which has been held to be a fundamental right under Articles 14 (equality before the law), 19 (freedom of speech and expression) and 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) by the Supreme Court, it added. It said the targeted hacking of phones belonging to journalists, doctors, lawyers, civil society activists, government ministers and opposition politicians seriously compromises the effective exercise of the fundamental right to free speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. It has an obvious chilling effect on expression by threatening invasion into the most core and private aspects of a person's life, it claimed. It claimed that the hack occasioned by the Pegasus spyware constituted a criminal offence punishable under interalia Section 66 (computer related offences), 66B (punishment for dishonestly receiving stolen computer resource or communication device), 66E (punishment for violation of privacy) and 66F (punishment for cyberterrorism) of the IT Act, punishable with imprisonment and/or fine. The attack prima facie constitutes an act of cyber-terrorism that has several grave political and security ramifications, especially considering that the devices of government ministers, senior political figures and constitutional functionaries which may contain sensitive information have been targeted, it added. Earlier, a petition was filed by a lawyer before the apex court seeking a court-monitored probe by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) into the snooping row.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-390
27-07-2021||India||Won't listen to elitists views asking to ban beggars on streets, says Supreme Court||Making clear it will not take an "elitist view" that no beggars be allowed on the streets, the Supreme Court Tuesday asked the Centre and Delhi government to respond to a plea seeking vaccination and rehabilitation of beggars and vagabonds in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The apex court said begging is a socio-political problem and people are compelled to beg on the streets to eke out some elementary livelihood in the absence of education and employment. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah told the counsel appearing for the petitioner that it would not consider one part of the prayer which sought direction to the authorities to restrain beggars, vagabonds and homeless persons from begging at public places or traffic junctions. The bench said it would issue notices to the Centre and the Delhi government seeking their responses on the prayer made in the petition for rehabilitation, vaccination and providing food and shelters to beggars and vagabonds amid the pandemic. "As the Supreme Court, we would not want to take an elitist view that no beggars should be there on the streets," the bench said. While referring to a part of the prayer made in the plea, the bench said it is seeking to restrain people from begging on the streets. "This is a socio-economic problem of poverty. The idea is to rehabilitate them, give them and their children education, it said, adding that such people have no choice and nobody wants to beg," it said. The bench said it is a wider issue of social welfare policy of the government and the apex court cannot say that such persons should be kept away from our eyes. The counsel appearing for the petitioner said the object and purport of the prayer is to rehabilitate them and ensure that they are provided vaccination, food and shelter amid the pandemic situation. The bench asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to assist it in the matter and posted it for hearing after two weeks. At the outset, the petitioner's counsel told the bench that issue raised in the plea is regarding rehabilitation of beggars as the impending third wave of Covid-19 pandemic poses a serious threat. The bench noted in its order that it has indicated to the petitioner that it is not inclined to countenance a prayer seeking directions to restrain beggars and vagabonds from the streets. "The reason why people are generally required to take to the streets to beg is to eke out some elementary livelihood in the absence of education and employment. This is a socio-economic problem and can't be remedied as sought in prayer A," the bench observed. It noted that petitioner's counsel has said that he is not pressing the prayer seeking directions to restrain beggars and vagabonds from the streets. "In view of the clarification issued, we are inclined to issue notice," the bench said, while granting liberty to the petitioner to amend the prayer. It said since the immediate issue which needs to be attended is that of vaccinating these persons, it would expect the Centre and Delhi government to apprise it about the steps which are being taken to deal with this human situation.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-390

Sources said the prime minister also asked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MPs to expose the Opposition parties as the government is ready for a discussion but they are not. Accusing the Congress and other Opposition parties of not letting the Parliament to function since it started for the Monsoon Session, the prime minister asked all MPs to expose the party before the public and the media. The session at the Parliament has been constantly interrupted due to protests from the Opposition and demands for discussions on the Pegasus phone-hacking row, the farm laws and other issues. Rajya Sabha proceedings were adjourned for almost an hour till 12 noon on Tuesday as a determined Opposition continued to protest against snooping of political opponents of the ruling BJP, journalists and government critics as well as over farm laws. Congress, TMC and other opposition party MPs rushed into the well of the House, shouting slogans against mass surveillance and farm laws. Slogan-shouting by the MPs, who also carried placards, drowned the voices of ministers and others who were called to lay official papers on the table of the House. On the other hand, Lok Sabha was adjourned till 12:30 pm for the third time since the House convened for the day, amid continuous protest by Opposition members over the Pegasus snooping controversy and farm laws. After the House convened for the day at 11 am, the Opposition members trooped into the Well, shouting slogans and raising banners. The Congress, CPI, CPI(M), TMC members were protesting over the Pegasus snooping issue, while the BSP, SP and Shiromani Akali Dal were protesting against three farm laws of the Centre. This has been the dominant behaviour in the Parliament this season and little to no work has been done amid protests by the Opposition. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar took a swipe at the protesting Opposition members and said if they are concerned about farmers, they should allow the proceedings of the House to continue. He made the remarks while replying to a supplementary query related to an insurance scheme for farmers during the Question Hour as the Opposition members continued with their sloganeering on various issues, including the Pegasus spying issue and the agriculture laws. On Monday the Centre reached out to the Opposition to end the deadlock over the issues, amid new demands that Home Minister Amit Shah resign and the Prime Minister be investigated. Meanwhile, addressing the BJP parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday, Modi also said the 75th anniversary celebrations of independence should not merely be a government programme, but it should be a people's movement with people's participation, Meghwal told reporters after the meeting. He asked the BJP MPs to form a team of two party workers in each Assembly segment, which will organise the programmes and seek suggestions and ideas from people on how they envisage India in 2047 when the country will complete 100 years of independence. The prime minister told the MPs that these teams of two BJP workers will visit 75 villages in each Assembly constituency and spend 75 hours in each constituency, Meghwal said. The 75 years of independence can also be celebrated by organising local sports events and cleanliness drives, Modi said. He also emphasised on the digital literacy of people in rural India so that they can avail maximum benefits of the government welfare schemes, the minister said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-390
27-07-2021||India||NSO Group's India client will be revealed soon: Chidambaram||The government would brazen out the allegations of snooping until it is known who the "Indian client" of Israeli firm NSO Group's Pegasus spyware was and that name would be revealed soon, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said on Tuesday. The former home minister said that based on investigations by an international group of journalists, news portal 'The Wire' has reported that there was "an Indian client of the NSO Group". Last week, an international media consortium reported that over 300 verified mobile phone numbers, including those of two ministers, over 40 journalists, three opposition leaders besides scores of businesspersons and activists in India, could have been targeted for hacking through the Pegasus spyware of the NSO Group. The government has been denying all Opposition allegations in the matter. "Who was the 'Indian client'? Was it the government of India? Was it an agency of the government? Was it a private entity?" Chidambaram asked in a tweet. "I am certain the client's name will be revealed soon. Until then, I suppose the government will brazen out the allegations of snooping," he said. Amid reports that French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on the Pegasus snooping allegations, Chidambaram had attacked the Centre on Monday, too, saying the only government that was "unconcerned" over the issue was that of India. The parliamentary panel on information technology led by Congress leader Shashi Tharoor is likely to question top government officials, including those from the home ministry, later this week on Pegasus snooping allegations, according to sources. The Pegasus scandal has created ripples all across the country with the non-BJP ruled states continuously attacking the Centre over snooping allegations. On Monday, Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced the nation’s first commission to probe the Pegasus snooping allegations, shortly before setting off for Delhi on a five-day trip during which she will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several Opposition leaders. Bengal’s two-man commission of inquiry will be made up of the retired Supreme Court judge, Justice Madan B. Lokur, and the former Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court, Justice Jyotirmay Bhattacharya. It has to submit its findings and recommendations within six months from Monday. Under its terms of reference, the commission is to ascertain whether any interception occurred; identify the state and non-state actors involved, if any; determine the mechanism used for the alleged hacking; find out whether Pegasus or any other spyware was used; examine the information collected, altered, stored or used; and gather the details of how people were affected.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-390

The Brazilian health regulator's decision comes after the vaccine maker informed the South American country about thetermination of its pact with its partners in that country. According to a statement issued by the National Health Surveillance Agency of Brazil, Anvisa, its Collegiate Board on Saturday unanimously decided "to close the process that dealt with the temporary authorization of emergency use, on an experimental basis, of the Covaxin vaccine". Earlier Anvisahad suspended the clinical studies of Bharat Biotechs COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin in Brazil following the termination of the companys agreement with its partners there. "The decision was taken after Anvisa was informed by the Indian company Bharat Biotech International Limited that the company Necessidade no longer has authorization to represent Bharat Biotech,manufacturer of the Covaxin vaccine, in Brazil," Anvisa said. Anvisa's decision refers to the request for emergency use of Covaxin that had been filed by the Brazilian company Necessidade with Anvisa. Bharat Biotech on July 23 said it terminated the MoU it entered with Precisa Medicamentos and Envixia Pharmaceuticals LL.C for its COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin for Brazilian market. The termination of the MoU came after the deal with the Brazilian Government for supply of 20 million doses of the Covaxin landed in controversy and attracted investigation by authorities in that country. Following the graft allegations and subsequent inquiry by the authorities, the Brazilian government had earlier suspended Covaxin's order temporarily. Bharat Biotech will continue to work diligently with Anvisa, to complete the regulatory approval process for Covaxin, Bharat Biotech had said while announcing the termination of its pact with its Brazilian partners.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-390

Some of the stretches and areas where waterlogging was seen included Dhaula Kuan, Mathura Road, Moti Bagh, Vikas Marg, Ring Road, Rohtak Road, Sangam Vihar, Kirari and near Pragati Maidan among others. The waterlogging also created traffic snarls in different locations of the city. Traffic moved at slow pace at ITO, underneath Moti Bagh metro station, Dhaula Kuan underpass, near Pragati Maidan, Mathura Road, Vikas Marg, Ring Road near IP Flyover, Rohtak Road among others. Public Works Department (PWD) officials said waterlogging complaints were being dealt with priority. Morning rain was of high intensity so a few areas of the city witnessed waterlogging. Our field staff is on the ground and we are closely observing the situation, a PWD official said. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the Southwest Monsoon had reached the capital on July 13, which was 16 days behind the usual date of onset. Normally, monsoon reaches Delhi by June 27. It covers the entire country by July 8.

27-07-2021||India||Pegasus : Mamata announces panel to probe snooping allegations||Mamata Banerjee on Monday announced the nation’s first commission to probe the Pegasus snooping allegations, shortly before setting off for Delhi on a five-day trip during which she will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several Opposition leaders. Bengal’s two-man commission of inquiry will be made up of the retired Supreme Court judge, Justice Madan B. Lokur, and the former Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court, Justice Jyotirmay Bhattacharya. It has to submit its findings and recommendations within six months from Monday. Under its terms of reference, the commission is to ascertain whether any interception occurred; identify the state and non-state actors involved, if any; determine the mechanism used for the alleged hacking; find out whether Pegasus or any other spyware was used; examine the information collected, altered, stored or used; and gather the details of how people were affected. Among those whose phone numbers are said to have been hacked is poll strategist Prashant Kishor, whom Trinamul has consulted extensively since 2019. The phone number of Trinamul Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee is reported  to be on the list of the potential targets of Pegasus-enabled spying. Mamata said the Bengal government was well within its rights to institute the probe under the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, as the state is home to people whose phones may have been hacked via the Israeli spyware Pegasus. “They (the retired judges) will see who hacked — totally illegal — how it is being done, in order to shut every mouth. It’s all done, ready…. We request Justices Lokur and Bhattacharya to immediately join and begin investigating this,” the chief minister said at a brief media conference at Nabanna before leaving for Delhi. The timing of the announcement makes it clear that Mamata would, during her Delhi trip, flag the subject to try and mobilise the Opposition against the Modi government. Bengal’s move comes at a time two public interest petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court seeking a court-monitored investigation into allegations that the Centre has snooped on judges, politicians, journalists and rights activists with Pegasus. The Narendra Modi government is yet to formally deny having bought the spyware. “I have an important piece of information to share with you,” Mamata said at the media conference. “The (state) cabinet has approved the appointment of a commission of inquiry… in the exercise of power conferred by Section 3 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, in the matter of widely reported illegal hacking, monitoring, putting under surveillance, tracking, recording, etc, of mobile phones of various persons in the state.” The Commission of Inquiry Act allows the Centre as well as the states to institute probes, Mamata later told The Telegraph. If the Centre orders an inquiry, the state cannot on its own appoint a panel to look into the same matter. Nor can the Centre order a probe under the act once a state government has done so — unless the Union government widens the scope to cover more states. “No state government shall, except with the approval of the central government, appoint another commission to inquire into the same matter for so long as the commission appointed by the central government is functioning,” according to the Commission of Inquiry Act. If a state government has ordered an inquiry, “the central government shall not appoint another commission to inquire into the same matter for so long as the commission appointed by the state government is functioning, unless the central government is of opinion that the scope of the inquiry should be extended to two or more states”. Mamata’s move is expected to put pressure on the Centre to order a wider probe as the possible targets for surveillance — as identified by a global media exposé on phone numbers earmarked for hacking through Pegasus — are based in multiple states. Sources close to Mamata said the chief minister had consulted multiple legal experts on the matter over several days, and spoken at length to Justice Lokur three times before arriving at the decision. Calls had gone out from her office to every member of her cabinet late on Saturday evening, asking them to show up before 1pm on Monday for a crucial cabinet meeting. Several ministers said in private that the agenda had not been shared with them till the meeting began. Since speaking out on the Pegasus controversy on July 21, Mamata has relentlessly tried to corner the BJP on the subject, accusing it of endangering India’s democracy through illegal snooping and urging the Supreme Court to take suo motu cognisance of the matter and intervene. After reaching Delhi on Monday, the chief minister went to the home of Abhishek Banerjee, the Trinamul MP and her nephew. There, she met senior journalist Vineet Narain, known for pursuing the “hawala scam” of the early 1990s. Narain had recently been booked by Uttar Pradesh police on various charges, including hurting Hindu sentiments, after he made land-grabbing allegations against a Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader and his brothers. On Tuesday, Mamata is scheduled to meet Modi and Congress leaders Anand Sharma, Kamal Nath and Abhishek Manu Singhvi. Sources close to her said she would keep the interaction with Modi a G2G (government-to-government) meeting, talking to the Prime Minister as chief minister of Bengal and bringing up the state’s demands and concerns, particularly those relating to vaccines and central dues. “Over the week, her trip will gather momentum with meetings with Sonia Gandhi, Sharad Pawar and other key Opposition politicians,” a source said. “In all this, her focus on the Pegasus scandal will remain unwavering.” The source said Covid concerns had forced several changes to Mamata’s plans, and that a proposed visit to Parliament’s central hall, for instance, was no longer a certainty. At the news conference at Nabanna, Mamata said: “For a week (since the media exposé), we had thought the Centre would definitely conduct a probe by a Supreme Court judge under the watchful eye of the Supreme Court, which people have faith in — while Parliament was on. “In that case, people would not have been denied justice. But when we saw that this Centre, even while Parliament was on, was not paying this any attention, Bengal became the first state — even before my trip to Delhi — to do this. “If somebody refuses to wake up, they have to be forcibly woken up. This is one small step by us, which we hope will awaken everybody else.” Bengal home secretary B.P. Gopalika issued the formal notification for the commission following approval from governor Jagdeep Dhankhar. The notification said the decision was taken keeping in mind the reports about widespread phone-tapping with sophisticated tools since 2017, which could potentially breach State secrets, jeopardise law and order in the state and violate privacy. “…The reported interception, if found to be true, shall result in grave interference with the privacy of the aforesaid individuals and the public at large…. (The) reported interception may have landed in the hands of state and/ or non-state actors, as being currently reported, which if found to be true can lead to a total breakdown of public order of the state and the same is serious criminal offence,” it said. It added that such snooping, if it happened, would cause “complete demoralisation” of the police force and other security services in the state, besides a “total loss of public confidence” in the police force.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-390
27-07-2021||India||Pegasus: Mamata appoints Lokur for a judicial probe into the scandal||Justice Madan B. Lokur, whom the Mamata Banerjee government appointed on Monday to a two-member judicial probe into the Pegasus controversy, has often found himself at odds with the Narendra Modi government. So much so that last October, the Centre had rushed to stall the Supreme Court’s move to appoint him as a one-man committee to monitor efforts to prevent Delhi’s air pollution. The government got the court to withhold the appointment by promising an ordinance on air quality management. As a sitting judge, Justice Lokur had headed a bench that delivered an unpalatable verdict for the Modi government on extra-judicial killings. Justice Lokur had condemned, after retirement, the use of the sedition law against “youngsters, students talking about doing something good for the country”. Justice Lokur confirmed his appointment by the Bengal government on Monday but told The Telegraph he was yet to receive the formal notification. “Obviously,” Justice Lokur said, asked whether the Bengal government had taken his consent before appointing him. He said he was not aware of the two-man commission's terms of reference or the timetable for submission of the report. “I’m yet to receive any formal communication from the Bengal government. As such I'm not in a position to say anything,” Justice Lokur said. Two petitions had been filed in the Supreme Court seeking a court-monitored investigation into allegations about the government snooping on judges, politicians, journalists and rights activists with the Israeli spyware Pegasus. The petitions by John Brittas, a CPM Rajya Sabha member from Kerala, and advocate M.L. Sharma are expected to come up for hearing this week. In 2018, a Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Lokur had ordered a CBI inquiry into the alleged killings of 1,528 people by the security forces in Manipur between 1985 and 2001, despite the Modi government arguing this would demoralise the armed forces. Justice Lokur retired in December 2018. At a webinar last September, he had said without mentioning names that “(the charge of) sedition is being used with an iron hand to curb free speech, which is an overreaction to people expressing views”. Alluding to Dr Kafeel Khan, a Gorakhpur doctor who has emerged as a symbol of resistance against State oppression, he had said that recently in Uttar Pradesh, a speech calling for the unity and integrity of the country was used to keep the speaker in preventive detention on the ground that the speech was against the country’s integrity. Justice Lokur’s willingness to express dissent also showed in the way he had in January 2018 combined with three fellow apex court judges to hold a news conference and accuse then Chief Justice Dipak Misra of allocating key cases to certain favoured junior judges. Last Saturday, Justice Lokur had again expressed his concern at provisions like the sedition law, the anti-terror UAPA and the National Security Act and at the way accused were treated in jail --- all implied criticism of the central government. He had mentioned Father Stan Swamy - an ailing 84-year-old Jesuit who died in custody in Mumbai this month - and Delhi University teacher Hany Babu, both arrested under the UAPA in the Elgaar Parishad-Maoist links case. “There is now… something called ‘soft torture’.... You have somebody like Hany Babu whose eye is in very bad shape and when it appears that he might lose his eye, then he will be sent to hospital but not before that. Everybody has talked about Stan Swamy. Why could he not be given medical treatment earlier? Isn't that torture?” Justice Lokur had said at a webinar. He had suggested fixing accountability. “The only way is accountability. Accountability has to be in two forms; one is financial accountability where compensation has to be given. Once the courts start telling police or prosecution that you better pay Rs 5 or 10 lakh, I think they'll probably come to their senses,” he had said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-390
27-07-2021||India||Farmers' protest: Rahul arrives in Parliament driving a tractor||Rahul Gandhi on Monday arrived in Parliament driving a tractor, intent on drawing attention to the government’s indifference towards the agitating farmers and appearing to leave the ruling dispensation embarrassed. “We have brought the farmers’ message to Parliament. The government doesn’t allow a debate on the farmers’ ongoing protest in Parliament,” Rahul told reporters, explaining the optics that would have delighted the farmers sitting on the roads outside Delhi. “They are suppressing the farmers. We have brought the tractor here to convey the farmers’ message to the government. The black laws will have to be repealed,” he added. The farmers are protesting against three new farm laws that they say would facilitate their exploitation by big companies. “These laws were framed to help two-three industrialists. The whole of India knows this. These laws are not going to help the farmers,” Rahul said. Rahul said: “They know why these laws were brought. They have to be taken back, there is no other way.” The Congress has regularly been protesting in Parliament demanding a discussion on the contentious farm laws and the Pegasus snooping controversy. No demonstrations are allowed near Parliament, and Rahul would definitely have been stopped on the way had he come the entire distance from his own residence on a tractor, which has become a symbol of the farmers’ protest. But the Congress leader had cleverly started off from the residence of party Rajya Sabha member K.T.S Tulsi, which is quite close to Parliament House. His arrival on a tractor at the gate of the complex caused a flutter. The red tractor carried a banner on the front condemning the three “black farm laws”. While Rahul drove the vehicle, party MPs from Punjab and Haryana sat with him on the tractor carrying placards demanding the repeal of the contentious laws. Those accompanying Rahul included Pratap Singh Bajwa, Deepender Hooda, Ravneet Singh Bittu, Gurjeet Singh Aujla, Amar Singh and Jasbir Dimpa. How badly the security establishment was rattled became immediately obvious from the tough action taken against Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala when he tried to drive the tractor back after Rahul had left it at Parliament’s entrance. Along with Surjewala on the tractor were Youth Congress president B.V. Srinivas and other party functionaries. The police promptly arrested all of them and drove them to Mandir Marg police station on a bus. They were released in the evening after daylong detention, during which Youth Congress workers protested outside the police station. The Congress accused the government of suppressing people’s right to protest. “We are not going to be frightened by the police’s highhandedness and handcuffs. The agitation in support of the farmers will continue under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi,” Surjewala said. “This is a battle for the survival of the farmers and the Congress will not allow the government to bulldoze its way.” The last time tractors had had a field day in Delhi was January 26, when the government had allowed the protesting farmers to hold a “tractor parade” along specific routes in Delhi. But with some breaches of route happening amid huge confusion, and a few ugly scenes witnessed at the Red Fort, the protesting farmers’ movement in the capital has been strictly restricted since then. Now 200 farmers are allowed to come on buses to Jantar Mantar daily to hold a symbolic protest. It was the turn of women farmers on Monday, when the Delhi police inexplicably prevented former Congress MLA Alka Lamba from joining the protest. She was placed under house arrest with the police saying no one who lacked prior permission would be allowed to join in. The farmers protesting for the past eight months at three venues outside Delhi – at the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders – have been desperately trying to catch the government’s attention. They plan to campaign against the BJP in the upcoming state elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Uttarakhand next year, and believe the party can be taught a lesson. The situation is extremely volatile in large swathes of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh where the farmers have prevented BJP leaders from holding any programmes.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-391
27-07-2021||India||Puri becomes the first city to turn tap water into drinking water ||Puri has become the first city in India to turn tap water into drinking water quality, and that too 24x7, through a smart water management technology built up by Odisha, and hence putting it in same pedestal with global cities like London, Singapore and New York. According to the state government sources, the tap water now complies with all the parameters mentioned in drinking water standard — Indian quality standard 10500 — prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standard. The initiative, dedicated to the people by Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Monday, is part of the government’s ‘sujal’ or ‘drink from tap’ mission and is likely to benefit city’s 2.5 lakh resident population, including 66,000 slum population as well as about 2 crore tourists who visit the holy city annually. “Providing drink-from-tap quality water 24x7 to every household is a transformative project and this is a step in the direction of our vision for making Puri a world class heritage city,” Naveen said while inaugurating the network. “Puri residents, tourists and pilgrims alike can now drink water from tap across the city be it at home or across the newly-established water fountains,” added Patnaik. Pilgrims will have access to 120 drinking water fountains set up all along the Grand Trunk Road and other Puri hotspots. The state-of-the-art technology, which allows people to drink directly from the tap, has been put into place after 100 per cent of its nearly 32,500 taps were fitted with meters. Government sources claim that metered taps will ensure less wastage of precious water; and drink from the tap mechanism will reduce plastic burden of the city. “The entire technology is automated and there will be real time monitoring system in various strategic points. Any dip in quality will be automatically corrected,” Mathi Vathanan, principal secretary, housing and urban development department in Odisha, told The Telegraph on Monday. Vathanan pointed out that the field engineer would receive alerts in their mobiles if there are any quality issues and be able to undertake corrective measures remotely. “While rich and even middle class people can buy quality water, the poor in slums and elsewhere suffer most for poor quality of drinking water and hence the project will benefit the poor most,” said the official. Environmentalist Subhas Datta questioned the source of the water supply. “Puri traditionally had a sweet water supply near the sea but rapid withdrawal has been turning it into saline. Any further withdrawal will put Puri in more difficult situation,” he said. “We are only using surface water for Puri’s water supply,” pointed out Vathanan.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-391
27-07-2021||India||Pegasus: Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee protests against alleged used of spyware||The Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee’s Bhubaneswar wing on Monday organised a demonstration on the issue of the Centre’s alleged use of Pegasus spyware to hack phones of politicians, ministers, journalists, industrialists and other eminent personalities. Party activists burnt the effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah at Master Canteen Square near the Congress Bhavan. “We demand a judicial probe into this. This kind of hacking of phones using the Pegasus spyware could not have happened without the knowledge of the Prime Minister and home minister. The home minister should immediately resign,” said senior Congress leader Biswajit Das. Odisha Pradesh Congress president Niranjan Patnaik said: “We are opposing the heinous move of the Centre tooth and nail.” The Centre has made an attempt to hack the phones of members of the judiciary as well as politicians. The country’s integrity is under question at the moment. It’s an anti-national act. Everything including country security and its sensitive internal affairs has been exposed. A judicial probe should be initiated into the issue.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-391
27-07-2021||India||Vikassheel Insaan Party boycotts alliance meeting in Bihar||The ruling NDA in Bihar faced a fresh crisis on Monday after ally Vikassheel Insaan Party boycotted an alliance meeting here on Monday alleging that its voice was not being heard. The move came on the heels of party chief and state animal husbandry and fisheries minister Mukesh Sahni being stopped at Varanasi airport on Sunday by the administration and police in Uttar Pradesh and prevented from taking part in the installation ceremony of a statue of bandit turned politician Phoolan Devi on her death anniversary. The programme was being organised by Sahni’s party. The party accused the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government in Uttar Pradesh of working for a particular caste and that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas (Together, for everyone’s growth, with everyone’s trust)” was not being implemented in the neighbouring state. The banners and posters put up in Varanasi for the ceremony were also allegedly dismantled by the district administration. Sahni had to go to Calcutta to catch a flight back to Patna because no direct flight was available. His request to allow him to go back by road to Bihar was not accepted. “Our voice is not being heard in the NDA, nor our demands being met despite being a part of the government. Therefore we did not attend the NDA meeting today (Monday),” Sahni, known as “Son of Mallah”, said. “We believe in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas slogan, but it is not being implemented in Uttar Pradesh. The government there is working for a particular caste,” Sahni added. The NDA is in power in Bihar with a thin majority. It has 126 members and support of an Independent MLA in the 243-member House. The Opposition Grand Alliance has 110 MLAs. Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM has five legislators while one seat is vacant. Sahni’s party has four MLAs, and even if it quits the NDA, it will not lead to the immediate fall of chief minister Nitish Kumar’s government but leave it in a precarious position. The majority figure in Bihar Assembly is 122. Sahni is a member of the Legislative Council. His comments about Uttar Pradesh, which goes to polls next year, could queer the pitch for the BJP, which is seeking to get re-elected under the leadership of Adityanath. Bollywood set designer turned politician Sahni represents the Nishad or Mallah (fishermen, boatmen) community from which Phoolan hailed. She was in direct confrontation with the Rajput community of Adityanath. An estimated 14 per cent of the population of Uttar Pradesh consists of the Mallah community. It has a powerful presence in several districts, especially those located in the middle and eastern parts of the state. The community constitutes around eight per cent of the population in Bihar. Sahni opened a party office in Lucknow on Monday and revealed plans to contest 165 seats in Uttar Pradesh polls. These constituencies have a sizable Mallah population. He also vowed to spread the thoughts of Phoolan. His plans to contest elections in Uttar Pradesh appeared to be an act of going against ally BJP which could hurt its poll prospects. “The Uttar Pradesh government is afraid of me. It was the reason for stopping me from holding news conferences and installing statues of Phoolan Devi. The police stopped supporters of my party in various parts of Varanasi. The Mallah community will show its strength in the 2022 elections,” Sahni said on Monday evening.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-391
27-07-2021||India||India-China clash: Beijing  ramps up military positions along LAC||China is ramping up its military positions, including airbases and air defence units, along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh amid the border standoff with India that has been on since May last year, sources said. Sources in the security establishment said China has been building additional airbases, runways and heliports along the LAC which could give them an edge over the Indian Air Force in the event of a conventional military conflict. “An intelligence report suggests that China is building additional air bases, heliports and air defence units near the Line of Actual Control as part of rapid expansion of Chinese military infrastructure in the region,” said an Intelligence Bureau official. A retired lieutenant general said China had better military infrastructure and, with additional airbases and air defence units, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army can deploy more fighters from its several airbases. “Rapid expansion of China’s military infrastructure, especially air infrastructure, is a cause of concern. It gives them a slight edge in the event of a military conflict,” he said. The IAF has also enhanced deployment of frontline jets, attack helicopters and transport fleet in its key bases along the LAC besides battle tanks, missile systems and frequent sorties by its combat aircraft. “China has also been aggressively ramping up its air and military infrastructure in other disputed areas along the LAC in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. This raises the risk of escalations and sustained conflict in these regions too, apart from Ladakh,” the veteran said. The intelligence report has also revealed that armies of China and Pakistan have been conducting regular joint patrols in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Beijing is also said to be helping Islamabad set up multiple surface-to-air missile launch sites and a missile defence system in the region. “As per the intelligence report, an increase in Chinese air activities has also been observed in PoK. There is a closer cooperation at military and economic level between the two countries in the region amid the ongoing border standoff and prevailing tension between India and China,” said a defence ministry official. Defence minister Rajnath Singh had earlier hinted at the collusive threat from Pakistan and China amid the ongoing border standoff in Ladakh. India shares a 7,000km-long border with these two countries. “We have got reports that construction activities are in full swing for setting up military infrastructure with the help of the Chinese army at several locations in PoK. The construction work for the installation of a surface-to-air missile defence system was being carried out by Pakistan Army and the (Chinese) People’s Liberation Army near Lasadanna Dhok of PoK,” said another IB official. Joint reconnaissance has also been noticed regularly between the Chinese PLA and Pakistani troops in forward locations like Deolian and Jura in PoK. According to the intelligence report, Chinese aircraft have been landing in Skardu in PoK for refuelling. The Skardu airbase is located around 100km from the Leh airbase on the Indian side. In the past Pakistan had conducted joint air exercises with China at the Skardu airbase. Despite opposition from New Delhi, both Islamabad and Beijing are also building the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor that traverses through the PoK which connects both the countries.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-391
27-07-2021||India||Karnataka: Tearful Yediyurappa steps down ‘voluntarily’||A teary-eyed B.S. Yediyurappa “voluntarily” stepped down as Karnataka chief minister on Monday, announcing his decision at an event to mark his two years in office and ending several days of suspense. The 78-year-old, four-time chief minister, who had won his current term by engineering defections and toppling the Congress-JDS government in 2019, said he had decided to quit on his own with no message coming from the BJP leadership. “I have decided to go to the Raj Bhavan after lunch and submit my resignation — not out of sadness but in all happiness,” an emotional Yediyurappa said at the end of a 20-minute address, his voice choking as he recalled how he had helped turn the BJP into a political power in Karnataka. “I’m happily going to the Raj Bhavan to submit my resignation, as others should get an opportunity,” he told reporters while leaving the state legislature complex. Governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot accepted the resignation and dissolved the council of ministers with immediate effect. With speculation about his exit swirling, Yediyurappa had on Sunday said he was expecting a “message” from the BJP leadership by evening and would take a decision after that. But after meeting Gehlot on Monday, he said that no word had come from Delhi. “I volunteered to resign since I have completed two years (as chief minister). There was no word from Delhi.” He refused to name a successor: “I will not name any names. It’s the party high command that will decide.” Yediyurappa said he would continue to work for the party to ensure it won the 2023 Assembly polls. Since talk about his resignation had triggered protests from his Lingayat community, Yediyurappa urged its pontiffs to honour his decision to resign and stop issuing statements on the subject. “Some 400 to 500 pontiffs had come to bless me and ask me to continue in office. Since I have resigned on my own, I beg them not to issue any statements and trigger problems. I shall always be indebted to them for their support,” he said. At the anniversary event, Yediyurappa had dwelt at length on how he had built the BJP up in Karnataka from a time when he was its lone MLA, after Vasanth Bangera resigned from the party, in the late 1980s. “Today I have the satisfaction of fulfilling my duties,” he said. Yediyurappa, known for his organisational skills even when the BJP enjoyed little support in Karnataka, recalled how Rajnath Singh and Sushma Swaraj had expressed surprise at the way he had mobilised thousands of farmers and women for two rallies in the state. “Atal Bihari Vajpayee had asked me to become a Union minister. But I told him I wanted to build the party in Karnataka (voice chokes) and won’t come to Delhi at any cost,” he said. “At the time there would be hardly 200 to 300 people even when Vajpayee, L.K. Advani or Murli Manohar Joshi visited Karnataka. I used to tour Shimoga district on a bicycle because we did not have a car. Today the party has grown across the nation.” The BJP won its first election in Karnataka under Yediyurappa’s leadership in 2008. But he got embroiled in controversies and corruption cases as chief minister, and the BJP forced him to resign in July 2011. He was arrested in a land scandal in October and spent 25 days in judicial custody. Angry at the way the BJP had treated him, Yediyurappa launched the Karnataka Janata Party, branded it a “secular” party and ensured the BJP’s defeat in the 2013 elections by cutting into its votes. He returned to the BJP in 2014. His exit now leaves the BJP without an experienced leader to helm the government. While the RSS wants to move away from caste equations by picking national organising secretary B.L. Santosh, a Brahmin who is close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, many in the state BJP are against ignoring the Lingayat community that has been the BJP’s mainstay all these years. Several aspirants have already made a pitch for the top job before the party leadership. Mines and geology minister Murugesh Nirani — who happens to belong to the Panchamashali Lingayat sub-sect — has visited Delhi twice in recent days. Union minister for parliamentary affairs Pralhad Joshi is widely seen as a non-controversial candidate who could take all sections along with him. While all the three deputy chief ministers too have thrown their hats in the ring, the 70-year-old Govind Karjol will have the edge if the BJP opts for a Dalit chief minister.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-391
27-07-2021||India||Opposition skips meeting called at short notice by Piyush Goyal||The Opposition on Monday decided to skip a meeting called at short notice by leader of the Rajya Sabha, Piyush Goyal, to counter the charge that the government had not reached out to them to try and end the weeklong stalemate over the Pegasus snooping controversy and repeal of the three farm laws. Responding to a direct charge by the RJD’s Manoj Jha that ministers had not reached out to Opposition members to evolve a formula to break the deadlock despite a directive from the chairman, Goyal said: “I am appealing and inviting, on the floor of the House, the honourable leaders of different parties to join me over a cup of tea today at six o’clock (6pm). I am publicly inviting them to join me over a cup of tea. We are happy to discuss all the issues, evolve a consensus and develop a formula.’’ Goyal’s appeal cut no ice. If anything, the sudden invitation for a meeting 50 minutes later without checking if the Opposition leaders were free at that time further upset them. “They think we are at their beck and call,’’ AAP’s Sanjay Singh told The Telegraph, adding that the Pegasus snooping case has serious ramifications involving the Rafale deal and blackmail. According to Binoy Viswam of the CPI, the sudden invite smacked of arrogance. “A government which has shown absolute disregard for all norms of democracy is trying to play a gimmick on Parliament and trying to befool the Opposition. The CPI does not want to be a party to this, and opted out of the meeting,” he said. Congress chief whip Jairam Ramesh said no one went for the meeting, underscoring his earlier tweet in which he spelt out the Opposition’s demands. “The entire Opposition is united. 1. Have a discussion on Pegasus snooping issue in presence of Prime Minister or Home Minister. 2. Announce a Supreme Court-monitored enquiry into the scandal. Parliament is not functioning because Govt is not agreeing to these legitimate demands,’’ he had tweeted. Trinamul Congress’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien supported Ramesh’s tweet after the invite and said: “We need this in #Parliament @narendramodi @AmitShah. Not green tea at @PiyushGoyal office. Thanks. But no thanks.’’ DMK’s T. Siva told this newspaper that there were only a few party leaders present in the House when Goyal made the invitation. “Is this the way to ensure that the entire Opposition is present?” he asked. In the House, Siva also objected to the Chair switching off the mike of leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge when he was interrupted by Goyal. The government’s contention is that Goyal and parliamentary affairs ministers had reached out to various leaders of the Opposition for finding a way out of the deadlock. “But there is no consensus among all the Opposition parties on many issues,’’ Goyal said. With former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Trinamul national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee featuring in the list of potential hacking targets in the Pegasus snooping case, both parties are unwilling to settle for the statement by the IT minister which has already been tabled in both Houses. This, they say, is way beyond his remit; adding for good measure that not only is Ashwini Vaishnaw new to the job but he also features on the list.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-391
27-07-2021||India||Tikait announces launch of 'Mission Uttar Pradesh-Uttarakhand'||Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait, who has been one of the faces of the farmers’ protest against the three central farm laws, on Monday announced the launch of “Mission Uttar Pradesh-Uttarakhand” to “defeat the BJP in the 2022 Assembly elections”. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi claims that there is nothing anti-farmer in the three farm laws. It is a big lie of the Prime Minister. One of the three laws states that the farmers will have to buy fertiliser, seeds, insecticides, equipment, etc, from the corporates under contract farming. It also states that the farmers have to enter an agreement with the banks to take loans to buy these things. The fact remains that the farmers take loan after mortgaging their properties,” Tikait said at a news conference of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha in Lucknow on Monday. “We defeated the BJP in Bengal and now we will dislodge them in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand because the government is not ready to repeal the black laws. Our first mahapanchayat of Mission Uttar Pradesh-Uttarakhand would be held in Muzaffarnagar on September 5,” said Tikait, who is the BKU spokesperson. The farmers had campaigned against the BJP during the March-April Bengal elections. “We are soon going to sit on dharna at all the entry points to Lucknow, the way we are doing it around Delhi. The government thinks we are getting tired and would suspend our agitation at Delhi’s borders but we are expanding our protest base,” said the BKU leader. The Morcha is a coalition of farmer unions which is spearheading the farmers’ protest since November last year. Farmers from several states are gathered at Delhi’s borders with Uttar Pradesh and Haryana for the past eight months under the Morcha banner. Tikait said he is not planning to contest elections as the sole aim of the Morcha was to remove the BJP from power so that the new government repeals the three controversial farm laws enacted by the Modi government. “We are at war with the ruling BJP and not a single farmer of the country will vote for the party in future. Our simple strategy is to support those who are able to defeat the BJP. We did this effectively in Bengal and will repeat it in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand in 2022,” said the farmer leader.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-391
