Numbers of Ambani and one other official of the Reliance ADG Group were included in the list as the Rafale deal came under public scrutiny. The opposition Congress had accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of settling for a grossly overpriced deal for 36 Rafale fighters only to help Mr Ambani win a whopping offset deal from Rafale maker Dassault. The phone number for Dassault Aviation's representative in India, Venkata Rao Posina, former Saab India head Inderjit Sial and Boeing India boss Pratyush Kumar were also on the list The developer of the Pegasus, Israeli firm NSO -- which claims it supplies its software only to "vetted" governments for control of terrorism and crime - has claimed the leaked list of numbers is "not a list of targets or potential targets of Pegasus.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-405
22-07-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi targets Centre over deaths due to oxygen shortage||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi once again hits out at the central government on Thursday over the deaths due to the shortage of oxygen during the second wave of Covid-19, saying ‘sab yaad rakha jayega’ (everything will be remembered). Rahul tweeted a 44-second video on his Twitter profile showing people searching for oxygen cylinders and carrying their loved ones for the oxygen during the second wave of the pandemic. The video, which opens with the message “the truth about oxygen shortage”, shows several images and news articles from the time of the second wave of Covid-19, and the related deaths reported across states and Union territories (UTs) owing to lack of oxygen. It may be noted that the Narendra Modi dispensation has faced intense criticism after it informed the Rajya Sabha that no deaths were reported due to lack of oxygen during the second wave. Rahul’s latest remark follows the one he made on Tuesday soon after Union minister of state for health and family welfare Dr Bharati Pravin Pawar, in response to Congress MP KC Venugopal’s question, told the Rajya Sabha that no deaths “due to lack of oxygen have been specifically reported by the states/UTs.” “It wasn’t just the lack of oxygen but also a severe lack of sensitivity and truth. It was then, still is today,” Rahul wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. Several opposition leaders apart from Rahul, including Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, Delhi deputy chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Manish Sisodia, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, and Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, criticised the Centre over its claim on oxygen shortage. However, many states have backed the claim as well, citing that no Covid-19 patients died in their states due to lack of oxygen.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-405
22-07-2021||India||Pegasus: Ex CBI chief included in target list following his termination||The Wire has reported that following the sacking of former CBI chief Alok Verma at midnight on October 23, 2018, an unidentified Indian agency, known to be a Pegasus user, noted three telephone numbers registered in his name. Along with Verma, the telephone numbers of his wife, daughter and son-in-law were eventually included in the list, totaling 8 numbers from one family. Numbers of two other senior CBI officials, Rakesh Asthana and A.K. Sharma, were also added to the list. Asthana was also removed from the CBI on the night of October 23, 2018;  he is currently head of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). Sharma was removed as the head of the policy division, but continued with the CBI till January 2019, when he was transferred out. He retired from government service earlier this year. Verma’s ousting came two days after he ordered the filing of a criminal case against Asthana, then special director, accusing him of corruption. Asthana, known to be close to PM Modi, filed a complaint against Verma with the Central Vigilance Commission two days later. It is also believed that Verma invited the Centre’s ire by not rejecting a request for a criminal probe into the controversial Rafale deal. On October 4, 2018, about three weeks before his termination, Prashant Bhushan and former Union minister Arun Shourie met him to hand over a complaint involving the Rafale deal. The government’s displeasure with this meeting was widely reported by news agencies at that time.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-405

They said some opposition MPs "misbehaved" with the treasury bench members, including a minister, even after the House was adjourned.  Sen snatched papers from Vaishnaw after the TMC, Congress and other opposition party members, who had earlier forced two adjournments of the proceedings in the Rajya Sabha, rushed into the well of the House as the minister was called to make a statement on the Pegasus snooping row.  The government will move a motion seeking suspension of Sen on Friday. Union Minister V Muraleedharan is expected to move the motion, sources said.  "We are approaching the Rajya Sabha chairman seeking action against them (opposition MPs) as their behaviour is a blow to parliamentary decorum," a Union minister, who did not wish to be named, said.  Government sources said Leader of the House in Rajya Sabha Piyush Goyal and his deputy Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi reached out to the Opposition members and assured them that the minister will reply to their queries after he makes his statement, but in vain.  With Vaishnaw not able to read out the complete statement, it was laid on the table and the House was adjourned. However, the situation remained tense in the House as the two sides engaged in heated exchanges.  Sen alleged that Union minister Hardeep Puri verbally abused him in the Upper House of Parliament and was on the verge of physically assaulting him before he was rescued by his colleagues. Puri has so far not commented on the issue.  The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has described the opposition conduct as a "new low" in Parliament.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-405
22-07-2021||India||Amarinder Singh to attend Sidhu's installation ceremony on Friday ||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has invited party leaders for tea on Friday from where they will "all go for the installation" of the new Congress team under Navjot Singh Sidhu, his media adviser said, signalling truce in the dissension-riven party. In an apparent bid to bury the differences with the CM, Sidhu too in a separate letter requested Amarinder Singh to come for the installation ceremony and said he had "no personal agenda". "My resolve and commitment on Punjab's issues and fulfilling high command's pro-people 18-point agenda for the welfare of every Punjabi is well-known to you and all," Sidhu said. "Thus as the eldest of our Punjab Congress family, I request you to please come and bless the new team," wrote Sidhu. The tweet by the CM's media adviser came after Kuljit Singh Nagra and Sangat Singh Gilzian, two of the four newly appointed working presidents for the state party unit, extended a formal invite to the CM at his farmhouse in Mohali's Siswan for the installation ceremony. The invitation letter was signed by over 55 legislators. Sidhu and Amarinder Singh have been at loggerheads for the past some time, with the Amritsar (East) MLA recently attacking the CM over the desecration cases. The chief minister had opposed Sidhu's appointment as the state Congress chief and had said he won't meet him until the cricketer-turned-politician apologises for his "derogatory" tweets against him. On Thursday, after the Congress leaders met the chief minister, the media adviser tweeted, "Punjab CM @capt_amarinder has invited all @INCPunjab MLAs, MPs and senior party functionaries at Punjab Bhawan for tea at 10 am on Friday. They will all then go to Punjab Congress Bhawan together from there for the installation of the new PPCC team." Nagra told reporters that the CM will come to the event. "An invitation from the pardhan sahib (PPCC president), ministers and MLAs has been given to the CM. He has accepted the invitation and will reach there to give his blessings," said Nagra. Incharge of Punjab affairs at the AICC, Harish Rawat, is also expected to attend the event. Congress president Sonia Gandhi had on Sunday appointed Sidhu as the new president of the party's Punjab unit, notwithstanding the strong opposition from Chief Minister Amarinder Singh. Gandhi also appointed four working presidents, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Sukhwinder Singh Danny, Pawan Goel and Kuljit Singh Nagra, to assist Sidhu in the run-up to the state Assembly elections next year. On Wednesday, several legislators backing Sidhu had said that there was no need for him to tender an apology to Amarinder Singh. Tensions between the CM and Sidhu flared up in April this year after the Punjab and Haryana High court quashed a probe report into 2015 Kotkapura police firing incident. Sidhu had attacked the CM through his tweets over the issue of alleged delay in justice in the 2015 sacrilege and subsequent police firing incidents. The Amritsar legislator had resigned as minister in 2019 after he was divested of his Local Bodies portfolio. Sidhu had joined the Congress after leaving the BJP before the 2017 Assembly polls.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-406
22-07-2021||India||Pegasus: Dalai Lama's advisors, NSCN leaders listed as potential targets||Top ring of advisers around the Dalai Lama and several leaders of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN) are among those listed as potential targets of Israeli spyware Pegasus, an international media consortium reported on Thursday. In the continuing series of reports on revelations from the international collaborative journalistic investigation called the Pegasus Project, the Wire has reported that phone numbers of multiple people close to Dubai Princess Sheikha Latifa, who was captured by Indian soldiers in 2018, were added to a list of potential targets for surveillance. According to a report in The Guardian, the phone numbers of the top ring of advisers around the Dalai Lama are believed to have been selected as those of people of interest by government clients of NSO Group. "Analysis strongly indicates that the Indian government was selecting the potential targets. Other phone numbers apparently selected by Delhi were those of the president of the government-in-exile, Lobsang Sangay, staff in the office of another Buddhist spiritual leader, the Gyalwang Karmapa, and several other activists and clerics who are part of the exiled community in India," it claimed. "Senior advisers to the Dalai Lama whose numbers appear in the data include Tempa Tsering, the spiritual leader's long-time envoy to Delhi, and the senior aides Tenzin Taklha and Chhimey Rigzen, as well as Samdhong Rinpoche, the head of the trust that has been tasked with overseeing the selection of the Buddhist leader's successor," the report added. The Pegasus spyware was created by Israeli technology firm NSO. The government has dismissed the reports on the use of Pegasus software to snoop on Indians, saying the allegations levelled just ahead of the Monsoon session of Parliament are aimed at "maligning Indian democracy". In a separate report by the Wire, the phone numbers of several top leaders of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak Muivah), NSCN (I-M) were added to a list of numbers of persons of interest believed to be generated by an Indian client of the Israeli spyware company. "In the aftermath of the August 2015 framework agreement, which is intended to resolve the six-decade-old Naga political issue, the NSCN (I-M) has been in talks with the Modi government to flesh out the details of a final settlement. Among the top leaders of the NSCN (I-M) whose phone numbers have been found in the leaked database are that of Atem Vashum, Apam Muivah, Anthony Shimray and Phunthing Shimrang. "The leaked records also shows that N. Kitovi Zhimomi, convenor of the Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs), with which the Modi government is also in parleys to find one solution' to the Naga issue since end 2017, was selected as a possible candidate for surveillance towards the end of 2017," the Wire report said. In another report, the Wire said, after princess Sheikha Latifa fled Dubai where her father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, is the ruler her closest relatives and friends had their telephone numbers added to a list of potential targets of a military-grade spyware. "Latifa's own number was added just before she fled but she had ditched her phone in Dubai before slipping across to Oman. While the UAE authorities had multiple methods of surveillance at their disposal, the analysis of a leaked database highlights how her escape seems to have coincided with the inclusion of several numbers related to Latifa appearing on a list of potential Pegasus targets," the report said. The reports have been published by The Wire in collaboration with 16 other international publications including the Washington Post, The Guardian and Le Monde, as media partners to an investigation conducted by Paris-based media non-profit organisation Forbidden Stories and rights group Amnesty International. The investigation focuses on a leaked list of more than 50,000 phone numbers from across the world that are believed to have been the target of surveillance through Pegasus software of Israeli surveillance company NSO Group.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-406

After a reporter referred to "farmers" attacking a camera person when he was covering their protests at Jantar Mantar, she said, "You should stop calling them farmers because they are not farmers. They are playing in the hands of some conspirators. Farmers don't have time to sit in Jantar Mantar. They are working in their farms. Middlemen are behind them (protestors) who do not want farmers to get benefits." She also cited the violent incidents in the national capital during farmers' protest on January 26, and said these protestors should not be called farmers. Replying to another question about the attack on the camera person, who work with a leading Hindi news channel, and also the January 26 incidents, she said, "You are calling them farmers again. They are mawali." She said such attacks are criminal incidents whose cognisance should be taken. The cameraperson was injured after he was allegedly attacked by a freelance journalist on Thursday at Jantar Mantar where the farmers are protesting against the new agri laws, police said. The cameraperson has been identified as Nagendra Gosain, police said. A senior police officer said Gosain was attacked by Prabhjot Singh, a freelance journalist.

22-07-2021||India||Centre tables Bill at Lok Sabha to ban people working in essential services from holding strikes||The government on Thursday introduced a bill in Lok Sabha which seeks to prohibit any agitation and strike by anyone engaged in the essential defence services. The Essential Defence Services Bill, 2021, introduced by Minister of State for Defence Ajay Bhatt amid din created by the Opposition over three new agri laws and the alleged Pegasus snooping controversy, seeks to replace an ordinance issued in June. According to the Statements of Objects and Reasons of the Bill, Indian Ordnance Factories is the oldest and largest industrial set up which functions under the Department of Defence Production of the Ministry of Defence. The ordnance factories form an integrated base for indigenous production of defence hardware and equipment, with the primary objective of self-reliance in equipping the armed forces with the state-of-the-art battlefield equipment. In order to improve autonomy, accountability and efficiency in ordnance supplies, the Government decided to convert the Ordnance Factory Board into one or more one hundred per cent government-owned corporate entity or entities to be registered under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. Against the decision, the recognised federations of the employees gave a notice for an indefinite strike. The conciliation proceedings initiated by the government at the level of Chief Labour Commissioner failed in the meeting held on June 15. On June, 16, the government decided to convert the Ordnance Factory Board into seven Defence Public Sector Undertakings. "In spite of the government's assurance to take care of the conditions of service of the employees of the Ordnance Factory Board, the recognised federations of the employees have reiterated their intention to go on an indefinite strike from July 26. "Since, it is essential that an uninterrupted supply of ordnance items to the armed forces be maintained for the defence preparedness of the country and the ordnance factories continue to function without any disruptions, especially in view of the prevailing situation on the northern front of the country, it was felt necessary that the government should have power to meet the emergency created by such attempts and ensure the maintenance of essential defence services in all establishments connected with defence, in public interest or interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India or security of any State or decency or morality," it read. The Statement of Objects said the ordinance issued on June 30 defines the expressions "essential defence services" and "strike". It also empowers the central government to prohibit strike in essential defence services and provides for disciplinary action, including dismissal, against employees participating in strike.It also provides for penalties for "illegal strikes, instigation thereof and providing for financial aid to such illegal strikes."||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-406
22-07-2021||India||Refusing to give up on their demands, farmers hold first Kisan Sansad session ||After eight months of harsh winters, unforgiving heat, and rains, farmers protesting against the three contentious agri laws on Thursday reached Jantar Mantar, a few metres away from Parliament where the Monsoon Session is underway, unrelenting in their demand that the legislations be scrapped. "We have come this far after losing many of our own. We are ready for a long haul. We have come prepared, said Harpal Singh from Bharatiya Kisan Union (Chaduni)," as he wrapped his saffron safa around his head. The 200 farmers, wearing identification badges and carrying flags of their unions, travelled to Jantar Mantar from their Singhu border protest site in four buses with a police escort. The protest was to start at 11 am, but the farmers reached the venue only by 12.10 pm. Farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka said police stopped them at three places en route and their Aadhaar cards were checked. Even a bus from Pakistan won't be subject to such strict checking The government wants to harass the farmers, Harpal Singh said. "Two of our buses broke down en route, so police escorted us in DTC buses," he added. Upon reaching Jantar Mantar, the farmers raised slogans, pumping their fists in the air, and demanded that the government scrap the three laws. However, they were restricted to a small section of Jantar Mantar with police putting up barricades on both sides. Farmers' representatives from several states, including Maharashtra, Odisha, Kerala, West Bengal, Telangana, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, joined the stir. They organised a Farmers' Parliament and debated the changes in the APMC Act in two sessions, punctuated by a 'langar' (community kitchen), on the first day. The debate also featured women and the elderly. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a joint forum of the farmers' unions protesting against the three laws, said 20 MPs from Kerala visited the farmers' parliament and expressed solidarity with them. As no politician was allowed to share the stage, the MPs joined in as audience. Farmer leaders say 200 farmers will come to the protest site everyday till August 13 to discuss the three laws clause by clause. Police threw a ring of security around central Delhi and kept a tight vigil on the movement of vehicles. Several teams of the Delhi Police manned the roads leading to the protest venue, while personnel of the Rapid Action Force, a specialised unit of the Central Reserve Police Force, stood guard at the site, carrying riot shields and batons. A water cannon and metal-detector gates have been deployed at the site. Two tankers carrying drinking water have also been stationed there. The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee organised a langar for the farmers and media persons and kept an ambulance on standby. The SKM was asked to give an undertaking that all COVID-19 norms would be followed, but hardly anyone wore a mask or maintained physical distance. Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal has given special permission for demonstration by a maximum of 200 farmers at Jantar Mantar, a few metres from the Parliament Complex, till August 9. This is the first time since the violence in the national capital during a tractor rally on January 26 that the authorities have granted permission to the protesting farmer unions to hold a demonstration in the city. Gathering for protests is currently not allowed in the national capital in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to an order by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority. Thousands of farmers from across the country have been agitating at three Delhi border points -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- against the three farm laws that they claim will do away with the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations. Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws at major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two sides.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-406
22-07-2021||India||UP: Family kills teen daughter over insistence to wear jeans||A teenaged girl died after she was allegedly thrashed by her family members over her insistence to wear jeans at a village here, police said on Thursday. Family members have also been accused of trying to dispose of the body by throwing it from over the Patanwa bridge on the Deoria-Kasya in Deoria but it got stuck in its railing and was spotted by police later. The 17-year-old Neha Paswan from Savreji Kharg village was severely thrashed by her family members after she insisted on wearing jeans and a top on Monday. According to the complaint given by her mother, the girl received serious head injuries when she was beaten up, leading to her death, Circle Officer (City) Yash Tripathi said. The post-mortem examination has also confirmed severe injury and fracture in the head, the CO said. Earlier Vivek, the younger brother of the girl, had told reporters that their uncles and grandfather were angry with her over washing of clothes and thrashed her. "While thrashing her, they were continuously abusing her for her dressing sense," Vivek said, adding that they used to always object to her wearing jeans and on that day too had asked her several times to stop wearing it. The girl's mother has given a complaint against 10 people, including grandparents. The case has been registered case under Sections 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence), 302 (punishment for murder) and other provisions of the IPC, Mahuadih SHO Ram Mohan Singh said. The grandparents have been taken into custody and are being interrogated. Police, however, said the story of family members being angry over her insistence on wearing jeans is not very convincing. The reason for the incident appears to be something else, which the family members are trying to hide and investigations are on, police said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-406

She further said that the prime minister has announced a scheme to support the children who have lost both parents or surviving parent or legal guardian or adoptive parents due to the pandemic. "The scheme provides support for education and health and will create a corpus of Rs 10 lakh for each child when he or she reaches 18 years of age. This corpus will be used to give a monthly financial support/ stipend form 18 years of age, for the next five years to take care of his or her personal requirements during the period of higher education and on reaching the age of 23 years, he or she will get the corpus amount as one lump-sum for personal and professional use," Irani said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-406

A five-judge bench hearing a clutch of PILs alleging that people were subjected to assault, made to flee homes and property were destroyed as a result of post-poll violence in Bengal, asked the state government to file its affidavit by July 26. The matter will be taken up for hearing again on July 28. In an indictment of the Mamata Banerjee government, the NHRC inquiry committee report had said the situation in the state is a manifestation of "Law of Ruler" instead of "Rule of Law". The seven-member committee, which submitted its report before the high court on July 13, recommended that investigation in grievous offences like murder and rape be handed over to the CBI, and these cases should be tried outside the state. Appearing for one of the respondents, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi claimed there were irregularities in the NHRC report and that it contained allegations of crime that preceded the date of declaration of Bengal Assembly election results on May 2. He also alleged that the report smacked of political consideration. Representing one of the petitioners, senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani submitted that the NHRC report reflected the true law and order situation in Bengal. He urged the bench, presided by Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal, to hand over the investigation into heinous crimes like murder and rape to an independent investigating agency for an impartial probe. The National Human Rights Commission, in its report, had also talked about "retributive violence" by supporters of the ruling party against those of the main opposition party. Criticising the NHRC observations, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had accused the BJP-led government at the Centre of "using impartial agencies to settle political scores" and "malign" the state.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-406

On July 2, Kumar through his advocate had urged prison authorities to provide him a television to remain updated about wrestling matches and other happenings outside the jail. The COVID-hit Olympic games will begin at Tokyo in Japan on July 23. Director General (Delhi Prisons) Sandeep Goel said, "We have allowed Sushil Kumar to watch television in the common area of his ward along with others since the Olympics is set to begin from tomorrow. "He has made a request through his lawyer for a TV to stay updated about wrestling matches and other happenings." Kumar was arrested along with co-accused Ajay Kumar on May 23 from outer Delhi's Mundka area. He and his associates allegedly assaulted wrestler Sagar Dhankar and two of his friends Sonu and Amit Kumar on the intervening night of May 4 and 5 over a property dispute. Dhankar, 23, succumbed to injuries later. Kumar, who is facing charges of murder, culpable homicide and kidnapping, was shifted to Tihar jail number 2 from Mandoli jail where he was lodged earlier. Police said 12 accused, including Kumar, have so far been arrested in connection with the Chhatrasal Stadium brawl case. The police have claimed that Kumar is the "main culprit and mastermind" of the murder and said there is electronic evidence in which he and his associates could be seen beating Dhankar. Last month, a Delhi court had dismissed an application filed by Kumar, seeking special food and supplements in the prison, saying that they are not the "essential need or necessity". Kumar had moved the Rohini court seeking special food, supplements and exercise bands in the prison, asserting that these are extremely necessary for him to maintain his health and performance.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-406

"It is an unethical government. We suspect that our numbers are also on list of those being snooped on," farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka said. "The government is behind the snooping. That's clear and the issue is gaining traction. We know that they are keeping an eye on us too," he alleged. Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav said the phone numbers of farmer leaders will figure in the data of the year 2020-21. "When this data will be made public, our numbers will be there, of course," he told PTI. The protesting farmers have come to Jantar Mantar to prove to the government that they are not fools, Yadav said, adding that the UK parliament debated their issues but not the Indian Parliament. Addressing a press conference, Yadav pressed for a debate on the issues raised by the farmers protesting against the central legislations. Another farmer union leader, Hannan Mollah, said they had written to all MPs to raise their demands, but alleged that Parliament was not taking up their issues.

A bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar said Deshmukh's plea seeking quashing of the FIR "deserved to be dismissed". The FIR was registered against Deshmukh and some unidentified persons on April 24 this year on charges of corruption and misconduct following a preliminary inquiry that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) conducted in compliance with the high court's order. The HC also refused Deshmukh's request to stay its judgement to give him time to file an appeal against the same. The inquiry was initiated into the complaint lodged by lawyer Jaishri Patil, in the aftermath of allegations of corruption levelled against Deshmukh by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. Deshmukh through senior advocate Amit Desai had sought that the FIR against him be quashed. The NCP leader had said the ongoing CBI inquiry against him was illegal, since the central agency had not taken prior sanction from the Maharashtra government to prosecute him. Additional Solicitor Generals Aman Lekhi and Anil Singh, who appeared for the CBI, had told the HC that no sanction was required, as by indulging in corruption and misconduct, Deshmukh hadn't been discharging his official duties. The CBI's FIR said Deshmukh had knowledge of the reinstatement of former assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, an accused in a case of bomb scare near the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani, and the NCP leader used to exercise undue interference in transfers and postings of Maharashtra police officers.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-407

There is currently no evidence of any new Delta sub-lineage that is of greater concern than Delta, it has said. "Delta continues to be the dominant lineage for new cases across all parts of India in recent samples and remains the most rapidly rising lineage globally that is responsible for multiple outbreaks, including across Southeast Asia, which shows the fastest growth in new cases globally," the INSACOG said. Regions with high vaccination and strong public health measures, such as Singapore, continue to do well, it noted. The Delta variant was behind the deadly second wave of the coronavirus in India that killed thousands and infected lakhs during March to May. The INSACOG said a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has confirmed that most of the clinical cases in vaccine breakthrough were infected with the Delta variant but only 9.8 per cent cases required hospitalisation, while fatality was found to be restricted to 0.4 per cent. It added that the data for higher infectivity of Delta continues to grow with the secondary attack rate in household contacts being almost double for Delta, when compared to Alpha (Public Health England, July 9 update). The other VoC continue to be very low in India and are declining relative to Delta globally. "Public health measures to reduce transmission and vaccination remain critical," the INSACOG stressed. No cases of the Lambda variant have so far been reported in the country, it added. In data from the UK, Lambda is still seen primarily in travellers or their contacts and is not growing relative to Delta. A growing spectrum of mutations is seen in the Delta background in the UK, the US and India. The most frequent spike protein mutations, other than K417N (AY.1/AY.2), seen in the UK are G446V and P251L. In India, A222V and K77T have been reported as possible markers of sub-lineages. Previous research into the A222V mutation for either transmissibility or immune escape was negative. In case of the K77T mutation, it has previously been reported in a cluster of Delta that spread to Asiatic lions in a zoo, and seen in sequences from Tamil Nadu, but has no known impact on transmission or immune escape in humans, the INSACOG said. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), jointly initiated by the Union Ministry of Health and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the ICMR, is a consortium of 28 national laboratories to monitor the genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-407

Led by AICC in-charge of Haryana affairs Vivek Bansal and state Congress chief Kumari Selja, the leaders and workers gathered at the party office here. They staged a protest outside the party office, but as they tried to march towards the Raj Bhavan on foot, police detained them. Congress leaders told reporters that the police cited the prohibitory orders in place due to COVID-19 and said they could not allow them to take out the march. "We were holding a peaceful protest, but the police did not allow us to proceed further," Selja said. The opposition party leaders said they wanted to hand over a memorandum to the governor in connection with the snooping row. Selja said the Centre must answer how the alleged use of Israeli spyware Pegasus to snoop on at least 300 phone numbers in the country, including those of opposition leaders, activists and journalists, happened right under its nose. She also claimed that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, whose name is on the list of the possible victims of the snooping row, has become a "target" for the government as he has constantly been raising various issues of public importance. "How can it be that such things are happening right under the nose of this government? How did this spyware come here, who gave permission? The government must answer these questions," the state Congress chief said. Meanwhile, asked why Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda did not join the protest, Bansal told reporters that the former chief minister had communicated that he would not be able to come as doctors had advised him a few days of rest on health grounds. An international media consortium reported on Sunday that more than 300 verified mobile phone numbers, including of two serving Union ministers, over 40 journalists, three opposition leaders and a sitting judge, besides scores of businessmen and activists in India could have been targeted for hacking through the Pegasus spyware.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-407
22-07-2021||India||TMC MP tears Ashwini Vaishnaw's statement on Pegasus as Rajya Sabha gets adjourned||Opposition TMC MPs on Thursday tore papers and flung them into the air, throwing the Rajya Sabha into bedlam as IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw read a statement on the alleged snooping using an Israeli company spyware Pegasus. TMC and other Opposition party members rushed into the Well of the House as Vaishnaw was called to make a statement over the issue. They shouted slogans and while TMC MP Shantanu Sen TMC tore papers that appeared to be copies of the statement that the minister was to make. As papers were flung into the air, the minister could not complete his statement and instead laid a copy of it on the table of the House. Deputy Chairman Harivansh asked members to desist from unparliamentary behaviour, before adjourning the proceedings of the House for the rest of the day. Opposition MPs had stalled the proceedings in the earlier part of the day as well, forcing two adjournments with not even officially listed papers being allowed to be laid. As soon as the House assembled for the day, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh tried to raise the issue of raids against the media group in multiple cities. They shouted slogans over alleged snooping and other issues. Government sources said Leader of the House in Rajya Sabha Piyush Goyal and his deputy Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi reached out to the Opposition members and assured them that the minister will reply to their queries after he makes his statement, but in vain. With Vaishnaw not able to read out the complete statement, it was laid on the table and the House was adjourned. However, the situation remained tense in the House as the two sides engaged in heated exchanges. Sen alleged that Union minister Hardeep Puri verbally abused him in the Upper House of Parliament and was on the verge of physically assaulting him before he was rescued by his colleagues. Puri has so far not commented on the issue. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has described the opposition conduct as a "new low" in Parliament.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-407

The Income Tax Department on Thursday conducted raids against the Dainik Bhaskar group and the Uttar Pradesh-based Hindi news channel Bharat Samachar in multiple cities over alleged tax evasion, official sources said.  Reacting to the raids, Kejriwal tweeted, "Income tax raids on Dainik Bhaskar and Bharat Samachar are an attempt to scare the media. The message is clear -- those who speak against the BJP government will not be spared. Such thinking is very dangerous. Everyone should raise their voice against it. These raids should be stopped immediately and the media should be allowed to work freely." The searches against Dainik Bhaskar are being conducted in Bhopal, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Noida and some other locations in the country. The premises of the Uttar Pradesh-based news channel Bharat Samachar and its promoters and staffers were raided in Lucknow, sources said. There was no official word from the Income Tax Department or its policy-making body, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), on the raids.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-407
22-07-2021||India||Centre calls media reports on Covid deaths being undercounted 'totally fallacious'||Refuting media reports that alleged India's Covid-19 death toll was "vastly undercounted", the government on Thursday said the reports assume that all excess mortality figures are Covid deaths, which is not based on facts and totally fallacious. "Given the robust and statute-based death registration system in India, while some cases could go undetected as per the principles of infectious disease and its management, missing out on the deaths is unlikely," the Union Health Ministry said. There have been some recent media reports alleging that India's toll of excess deaths during the pandemic could be in millions, terming the official Covid-19 death toll "vastly undercounted", the ministry said in a statement. In these news reports, quoting findings from some recent studies, the US and European countries' age-specific infection fatality rates have been used to calculate excess deaths in India based on the sero-positivity. "The extrapolation of deaths has been done on an audacious assumption that the likelihood of any given infected person dying is the same across countries, dismissing the interplay between various direct and indirect factors such as race, ethnicity, genomic constitution of a population, previous exposure levels to other diseases and the associated immunity developed in that population," the statement said. Furthermore, the sero-prevalence studies are not only used to guide strategy and measures to further prevent the spread of infection to the vulnerable population but are also used as another basis to extrapolate deaths. The studies also have another potential concern that the antibody titers may diminish over time, leading to underestimation of true prevalence and corresponding overestimation of infection fatality rate. "Further, the reports assume that all the excess mortality figures are Covid-19 deaths, which is not based on facts and totally fallacious. Excess mortality is a term used to describe an all-cause mortality figure and attributing these deaths to Covid-19 is completely misleading," the statement said. India has a thorough contact-tracing strategy. All the primary contacts, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, are tested for Covid-19. The true detected cases are the ones that test positive with RT-PCR, which is the gold standard of Covid-19 test. In addition to the contacts, given the vast availability of more than 2,700 testing laboratories in the country, anyone who wants to get tested is able to get the test done. This, coupled with awareness campaigns about the symptoms and access to medical care, has ensured people could reach out to hospitals in case of need. Given the robust and statute-based death registration system in India, missing out on the deaths is unlikely. This could also be seen in the case fatality rate, which, as on 31st December 2020, stood at 1.45 per cent and even after an unexpected surge observed in the second wave in April-May 2021, the case fatality rate today stands at 1.34 per cent, it said. Moreover, the reporting of daily new cases and deaths in India follows a bottom-up approach, where districts report the number of cases and deaths to the state governments and to the Union Ministry on a continuous basis, the statement said. As early as May 2020, to avoid inconsistency or confusion in the number of deaths being reported, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) issued 'Guidance for appropriate recording of Covid-19 related deaths in India' for correct recording of all deaths by States/UTs as recommended by the WHO for mortality coding. In his statement in Rajya Sabha, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya has refuted allegations of hiding Covid-19 deaths and said that the central government only compiles and publishes data sent by the state governments, the statement said. The Union Health Ministry has been repeatedly advising states and UTs for recording of deaths in accordance with guidelines. The Health Ministry has also regularly emphasised the need for a robust reporting mechanism for monitoring district-wise cases and deaths on a daily basis. States have been advised to conduct thorough audits in their hospitals and report any cases or deaths that could have been missed with a district and date-wise details so as to guide a data-driven decision-making. During the peak of the second wave, the entire health system was focused on effective clinical management of cases requiring medical help, and correct reporting & recording could have been compromised which is also evident in a few states such as Maharashtra, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh reconciling their number of deaths recently. In addition to this reporting, the robustness of the statute-based Civil Registration System (CRS) ensures all the births and deaths in the country get registered. The CRS follows the process of data collection, cleaning, collating and publishing the numbers, which although is a time-consuming process, but ensures no deaths are missed out. For the expanse and amplitude of the activity, the numbers are usually published a year later, the statement said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-407

The apex court also said the "colonial mindset meted out to the district judiciary" must change to preserve the faith of citizens and stated that judges are "made targets when they stand up for what is right". The top court made these crucial observations while cancelling the bail granted to Madhya Pradesh BSP MLA's husband, who was arrested in over two-year-old murder case of Congress leader Devendra Chourasia. "An independent and impartial judiciary is the cornerstone of democracy and it should be immune from political pressures and considerations," the top court said. "India cannot have two parallel legal systems, one for the rich and resourceful and those who wield political power and the other for small men without resources without capabilities to gain justice. "The existence of dual system will only chip away the legitimacy of the law. The duty also falls on the state machinery to be committed to the rule of law," the top court said. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said district judiciary is the first point of interface with the citizens. "If the faith of citizens in the judiciary is to be preserved, it is the district judiciary on which attention must be focused," the bench said. The top court said trial court judges work amidst appalling conditions, lack of infrastructure, inadequate protection and there are examples of judges being made targets when they stand up for what is right. "Also there is sadly a subservience to the administration of the high courts for transfers and postings which renders them vulnerable," the bench said. "The colonial mindset meted out to the district judiciary must change, it is only then that civil liberties for every citizen, be it accused victim or civil society will be meaningfully preserved in our trial courts which are first line of defence for those who are being wronged," the bench said. The apex court said function of the judiciary as an independent institution is rooted in concept of separation of powers. "Individual judges must be able to adjudicate disputes in accordance with law unhindered by any other factors and for that reason independence of judiciary and of each judge is a must," the bench said. "Independence of individual judges also encompasses that they are independent of their superiors and colleagues," it said adding that our constitution specially envisages Independence of district judiciary which is mentioned in Article 50. If District judiciary operates under the supervision of the high court then is it must secure its independence from from external influence and control. "This compartmentalisation of judiciary and executive should not be breached by personal decision making of the judges and the conduct of court proceedings under the relevant acts," the bench said. The top court said there is no gainsaying that judiciary should be immune to political pressures and considerations. A judiciary susceptible to such pressures allows politicians to operate with impunity and criminality to flourish in the political apparatus of the state. The apex court said the the judges being undeterred in their commitment to follow law and do justice should be cautious of launching a diatribe against state authorities without due care and diligence.

Two of the builder's partners, Sunil Jain and Sanjay Punamia, have been arrested in the case, he said. According to the complaint, Jain and Punamia had conspired with police officials and demanded Rs 15 crore from the builder to withdraw some cases against him, he said. The builder had named former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh along with others in his complaint, the official said. The case has been registered under Indian Penal Code Sections 387, 388, 389 (all pertaining to extortion), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 403 (dishonest misappropriation of property), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant), 423 (dishonest or fraudulent execution of deed of transfer containing false statement of consideration), 464 (making false document in name of fictitious person), and 465, 467 468, 471 (all for forgery), and other sections.

Mumbai, its neighbouring Thane and Palghar and other districts in the Konkan region have been witnessing heavy downpour since the last few days, leading to inundation at several places and disruption of rail and road transport services. Water level of many rivers has risen and crossed the danger mark at some places. The Indian Meteorological Department has meanwhile issued a red alert for Mumbai and an orange alert for Maharashtra's East Vidarbha region, which includes districts such as Bhandara, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli and Yavatmal, indicating the likelihood of heavy to very heavy showers. An official statement issued by the NDRF said four of its teams have been deployed in Mumbai, and one each in Thane and Palghar districts. One team will reach Chiplun town in Ratnagiri district by late afternoon. Besides, two teams have been sent to Kolhapur district. One of it will undertake rescue or preventive evacuation in the flood-prone Shirol tehsil, while the other one will conduct rescue work in Kolhapur city, the NDRF said. Some villages in the Sahapur taluka of Thane were marooned, a local official earlier said, adding that authorities with the help of the NDRF rescued hundreds of people from those places. Incidents of water-logging leaving people stranded were also reported from Mumbra, Bhiwandi, Titwala and Kasara areas of Thane district. Various places in Vasai, Virar and other locations in Palghar also witnessed flooding, but no loss of life was reported so far, officials said. The Modak Sagar dam at Sahapur in Thane started overflowing in the early hours of Thursday and two of its gates were opened to release the water, the district administration said. Train services of the Central Railway in the Kasara Ghat section of Thane and near Lonavala hill town in Pune district adjoining Mumbai were severely affected after heavy rains caused flooding, washing out of tracks, boulder crashes and mudslides in that region, officials said. Besides, train services on the Konkan Railway route in Ratnagiri were also suspended in the morning after a river overflowed following heavy rains in the area, they said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-408
22-07-2021||India||Delhi HC seeks Centre's reply on plea challenging IT Rules||The Delhi High Court Thursday sought the Centre's reply on a plea challenging the new IT Rules for allegedly being in gross disregard of the fundamental rights of free speech and privacy of users of social media intermediaries such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Twitter. A bench of Justice Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to the Centre on advocate Uday Bedi's plea contending that the new IT rules are unconstitutional and antithetical to the fundamental principles of democracy. Granting time to the Centre to file its counter affidavit, the court listed the plea for further hearing on September 13. In his petition, Bedi has argued that the social media intermediaries cannot be given the power to decide, on the basis of a complaint or otherwise, as to which information is liable to be taken down. The petition states that the new Information Technology Rules themselves do not define how the social media intermediaries would voluntarily take action against a complaint without peeping into all conversations over the SMI platform and that it is not possible to trace the first originator of a message without decrypting all the private information that is stored, published, hosted or transmitted through the platform. While giving powers in excess of the powers given under the parent legislation, the IT Act, to voluntarily remove access to information that does not conform to Rule 3(1)(b), the Impugned Rules have allowed the social media platforms to place the users under constant surveillance which is a gross breach of the right to privacy, the petition reads. The rules also mandate that even if the person is not under any investigation for violation of the rules, the intermediary has to retain his or her data without any justification, which is a gross violation of the right to privacy of the user, the petition further said. Emphasising that no appellate procedure has been provided for under the rules against the decision of a Grievance Officer and/or the Chief Compliance Officer, Bedi, in his plea, has added that wide powers to restrict free speech of citizens have been placed in the hands of private individuals, which is shockingly disproportionate and completely unjustified. There is also no mandate that the author of the allegedly objectionable information has to be heard before deciding any complaint against him/her, it is stated.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-408
22-07-2021||India||Farmers to hold Kisan Parliament near Jantar Mantar from today||A group of 200 farmers reached Jantar Mantar in central Delhi on Thursday to protest against the Centre's three contentious farm laws as the Monsoon session of Parliament was underway. Police threw a ring of security around central Delhi and kept a tight vigil on the movement of vehicles. Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal has given special permission for demonstration by a maximum of 200 farmers at Jantar Mantar, a few metres from the Parliament Complex, till August 9. The 200 farmers, wearing identification badges and carrying flags of their unions, travelled to Jantar Mantar from their Singhu border protest site in buses with a police escort. The protest was to start at 11 am, but the farmers reached the venue only by 12:25 pm. Farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka said police stopped them at three places en route and their Aadhaar cards were checked. Upon reaching Jantar Mantar, farmers raised slogans, demanding the government scrap the three laws. The protesting farmers have been restricted to a small section of Jantar Mantar with police putting up barricades on both sides. Several teams of the Delhi Police manned the roads leading to the protest venue, while personnel of the Rapid Action Force, a specialized unit of the Central Reserve Police Force, stood guard at the site, carrying riot shields and batons. A water cannon and metal detector gates have been deployed at the site. Two tankers carrying drinking water have also been stationed there. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions spearheading the protest against the three farm laws, has been asked to give an undertaking that all COVID-19 norms would be followed and the stir would be peaceful. Although the SKM had said that their protest at Jantar Mantar would continue till the end of the Monsoon session of Parliament on August 13, the lieutenant governor has given permission for protest till August 9. This is the first time since the violence in the national capital during a tractor rally on January 26 that the authorities have granted permission to the protesting farmer unions to hold a demonstration in the city. Gathering for protests is currently not allowed in the national capital in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an order by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority. What the peasants plan After a meeting with Delhi Police officials on Tuesday, a farm union leader said they will hold peaceful demonstrations at Jantar Mantar demanding scrapping of the agri laws and no protester will go to Parliament. "We will hold 'Kisan Parliament' from July 22 till the monsoon session ends and 200 protesters will go to Jantar Mantar every day. One speaker and one deputy speaker will be chosen every day. "In the first two days, there will be a discussion over the APMC Act. Later, the other bills will also be discussed every two days," a leader had said. Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Mahasangh national president Shiv Kumar Kakka on Tuesday told PTI that farmers, wearing identification badges, will go to Jantar Mantar from the Singhu border to hold the protest. "We informed the police that every day 200 farmers will go to Jantar Mantar from the Singhu border in buses during the monsoon session. It will be a peaceful demonstration and protesters will have identification badges. "When police asked us to reduce the number of protesters, we told them to focus on the law-and-order situation and also gave assurance that the protest will be peaceful," Kakka had said. A tractor parade in Delhi on January 26, that was to highlight the demands of farmer unions to repeal three agriculture laws, had dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital as thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with the police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort. Congress support to farmers Congress MPs staged a protest inside the Parliament complex in support of protesting farmers and demanded that the three agriculture laws be withdrawn. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and other leaders of the party participated in the protest. Congress MPs from both houses gathered outside Mahatma Gandhi's statue in Parliament complex and raised slogans against the government and the prime minister. Carrying placards and hoardings, they also raised slogans in support of the farmers and their demands. The Congress has been demanding the repeal of the three farm laws, which the farmers are against alleging that these legislations will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave them at the mercy of big corporates. The government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-408
22-07-2021||India||Yediyurappa breaks silence on his future as Karnataka CM||Amid heightened buzz over his continuation as Chief Minister of Karnataka, B S Yediyurappa on Thursday indicated that his exit was imminent and said he will remain in the post till the BJP's central leadership asks him to step down. The 78-year-old Lingayat strongman said he had offered to resign two months ago with an intention to make way for others and asserted that he won't name a possible successor even if asked to. "Centreal BJP leaders did not talk about his replacement during his recent Delhi visit," he said. "The party high command is likely to give directions on July 25 regarding my future as the Chief Minister and I will continue to perform my duties till the last minute and thereafter will work for strengthening the BJP with an aim to bring it back to power," he added. "I still haven't got any message (regarding his future as CM), I'm waiting if there will be any message on July 25. I will abide by the Centre's decision, I have said this in the past and I'm saying it once again," Yediyurappa said. Speaking to reporters here, he said, "Whether in power or not, I will travel across the state and work towards strengthening the organisation and bringing the party back to power. As long as I'm asked to be the Chief Minister, I will remain in the post, when I'm told they don't want me in the post I will work towards strengthening the organisation." Yediyurappa's government will be completing two years in office on July 26. Noting that he will continue with the work and will inspect the developmental works in Bengaluru on Friday like construction of roads and rajakaluves (storm water drains), the Chief Minister said, "I will perform my duties till the last minute, let's see what happens in the end." Asserting that there is no confusion and the party is united, he said abiding by the instructions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP national President J P Nadda is "our duty". Reiterating his earlier statement that there are alternative leaders in the state to replace him, Yediyurappa said, "I will not make any suggestion (on successor).. who should be made (the next CM) is left to the central leadership. I'm not naming any one, there is no need for it also. Even if I'm asked, I will not suggest any names." Asked whether any one from the Lingayat community should be his successor, the leader who hails from the community said, "I will not put any such pressure. Why are you coming to such decisions so soon? After July 25, based on what the central leadership says, let's see." To a question whether the central leaders spoke to him regarding the replacement, during the recent visit, he said, "absolutely not." The CM on Thursday chaired a cabinet meeting, which is being seen as his "last", in case he steps down after July 26. Earlier in the day, Yediyurappa said he will abide by the BJP central leadership's decision, regarding his continuation as the CM. Based on the instructions that the central leaders will give him on July 25, he said he will begin "his work" from July 26. "We have a special programme on July 26 regarding two years of our government, after attending that programme, I will abide by the instructions from the national president," he said. "PM Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, and Nadda have a special love and faith towards me. You are aware that no position has been given to those who have crossed 75 years of age," he said, but appreciating his work they have given me an opportunity despite his age crossing 78. Yediyurappa's sudden trip to Delhi last week during which he met national leadership, had raised questions in some quarters if the party is now working out a succession plan. On his return from the national capital, Yediyurappa had however, rubbished talks in some quarters that he is on way out, and asserted that the central leadership has asked him to continue in the post. Asking his supporters and well wishers not to give any statements in his favour or indulge in any kind of protest, Yediyurappa said, "It is not appropriate, I appeal for cooperation, without indulging in such things." Hundreds of pontiffs belonging to various communities have blessed me and have extended their support, he said, "I cannot forget this throughout my life. No one has got such support in the past.. with their blessing, I will function according to the decision of the high command." Support has continued to pour in for Yediyurappa from Mutts, pontiffs, political leaders across the party line (especially Congress), amid speculations that his exit was on the cards. Leaders and pontiffs, especially from the Veerashaiva- Lingayat community, and also All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha have declared support to Yediyurappa and have urged for his continuation as the Chief Minister, while also warning "bad consequences" for the BJP if he is replaced. While, BJP National General Secretary in-charge of Karnataka Arun Singh, ducked the questions on leadership change in the state, several Ministers of Yediyurappa cabinet either maintained that they were unaware of the developments or said that they will abide by the decision of the high command. Revenue Minister R Ashoka and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who have been dismissing reports of possible leadership change in the past few days, today said they will abide by the decision of the high command and they were not aware of what discussions are happening at the leadership level. Food and Civil Supplies Minister Umesh Katti expressing his aspiration to become CM said, he has all the "qualifications" as he has won assembly election nine times. "I also desire to become CM, age is also on my side as I'm 60 years now... may become someday. If I get an opportunity I will perform by giving good administration." Rural Development Minister K S Eshwarappa, welcoming Yediyurappa's statement to abide by high command's decision and the party, appealed to pontiffs not to cause embarrassment to the CM by issuing statements against BJP while demanding for his continuation. Meanwhile, there seems to be a sense of nervousness among 12 legislators who became ministers after defecting from the Congress and JD(S), as they had come to BJP trusting Yediyurappa's leadership, and without him they fear uncertainty, sources said, adding that they met the Chief Minister today. On the other hand, accusing Yediyurappa of providing a "bad government" to Karnataka, Senior Congress leader and leader of opposition in the assembly, Siddaramaiah said he doesn't expect that the state will get a competent government and a honest CM by removing him, as the BJP itself is a "corrupt party".||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-408

India's COVID-19 tally had crossed the 20-lakh mark on August 7, 30 lakh on August 23, 40 lakh on September 5 and 50 lakh on September 16. It went past 60 lakh on September 28, 70 lakh on October 11, crossed 80 lakh on October 29, 90 lakh on November 20 and surpassed the one-crore mark on December 19. India crossed the grim milestone of two crore on May 4 and three crore on June 23. The 507 new fatalities include 165 from Maharashtra and 105 from Kerala.

The ministry stressed that more than 70 per cent of the deaths occurred due to comorbidities. "Our figures are being reconciled with the Indian Council of Medical Research," the ministry said on its website, adding that state-wise distribution of figures is subject to further verification and reconciliation.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-408
22-07-2021||India||Tax department raids multiple premises of media group Dainik Bhaskar||The Income Tax Department on Thursday conducted multi-city raids against two prominent media groups -- Dainik Bhaskar and Bharat Samachar -- on charges of tax evasion, official sources said. The searches against Dainik Bhaskar are being conducted in Bhopal, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Noida and some other locations in the country. The premises of the Uttar Pradesh-based news channel Bharat Samachar and its promoters and staffers were raided in Lucknow, they said. There was no official word from the Income Tax Department or its policy-making body, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), on the raids. Tax sleuths also raided some premises linked to BJP MLA from UP's Harraiya assembly seat in Basti district Ajay Singh and his associates. It was, however, not immediately clear if the raids on the legislator and the media groups were connected. Sources said the action against the Dainik Bhaskar group included searches at the residential premises of its promoters in Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal. Personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and Madhya Pradesh Police were seen providing security to the tax officials in Bhopal. The two media groups have been critical of the COVID-19 management in the country and have done numerous stories highlighting failings of authorities and people's distress during the second wave of the pandemic that peaked in India in April-May. The Dainik Bhaskar group has presence across 12 states of the country and brings out 65 editions and 211 sub-editions in Hindi, Gujarati and Marathi, according to information provided on the website of its parent company D B Corp Ltd. It also operates 30 radio stations in seven states and has online presence with six web portals and four mobile phone apps. The Bharat Samachar TV said on its official Twitter handle that searches are being conducted at the "house of its Editor-in-chief Brajesh Mishra, state head Virendra Singh, houses of some employees and the channel office." Dainik Bhaskar later posted a message on its website saying income tax teams raided its offices in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan. It said the government raids have come against it as it put out the "true picture of the government's inefficiency before the country during the second wave of COVID-19." It said the raids were carried out at residences of many staffers, they seized the mobile phones of those present in the offices and they were not being allowed to go out. "Officials involved in the raids said this was part of the process and they will be released after panchmana proceedings are done," it said. It said the digital team working on the night shift was released at 12:30 pm. It said the tax teams had no women members as it raided its Bhopal and Ahmedabad digital wing offices where female staffers were present. Senior income tax officers in the team have not clarified the reason for these searches till now, it said. Congress leader and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijaya Singh said on Twitter that tax officials "are present" at at half-a-dozen premises of the Dainik Bhaskar group, including at its office at the Press Complex in Bhopal. Reacting to the raids, Aam Aadmi Party leader and Delhi Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said they are an "attempt to scare the media." "Their message is clear that whoever will speak against the BJP government, they will not be spared. Such thinking is very dangerous. Everyone should raise their voice against this," he said in a tweet. "These raids should be stopped immediately and the media should be allowed to work freely," he added. Congress leader and Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot said the raids "on Dainik Bhaskar newspaper & Bharat Samachar news channel is a brazen attempt to suppress the voice of media." "Modi government cannot tolerate even an iota of its criticism. Due to its fascist mentality, the BJP doesn't want to see the truth in a democratic setup," he tweeted.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-408

22-07-2021||India||Security beefed up at Jantar Mantar in view of farmers' protest||Security at Jantar Mantar in central Delhi has been tightened in view of a protest by farmers against the Centre's agri laws on Thursday amid the Monsoon session of Parliament, officials said. Adequate security arrangements have been made and police and paramilitary personnel deployed, they said. Jantar Mantar is a few metres away from the Parliament House where the Monsoon session is underway. A group of 200 farmers will travel to Jantar Mantar from their Singhu border demonstration site in buses with a police escort and hold protest there from 11 am to 5 pm. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions which has been spearheading the protest against the three farm laws, has been asked to give an undertaking that all COVID-19 norms would be followed and the stir would be peaceful. This is the first time since the violence in the national capital during a tractor rally on January 26 that the authorities have granted permission to the protesting farmer unions to hold a demonstration in the city. Thousands of farmers from across the country have been agitating at three Delhi border points -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- against the three farm laws that they claim will do away with the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations. Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws at major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two sides.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-408
22-07-2021||India||Manoj Jha’s apology to the Covid dead fills a national vacuum||An apology rang out in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, addressed “to all those citizens whose deaths we didn’t even acknowledge”, “to the bodies floating in the Ganga that we sought to dismiss” and “to those who in their passing have left behind a living document of our failures”. The moment of introspection came not from the Narendra Modi government, which on the very same day was splitting hairs to deny knowledge of any oxygen-related deaths during the Covid second wave. The “maafinama (apology)” was delivered by Manoj Jha, a Rajya Sabha member of the Rashtriya Janata Dal and a professor at Delhi University. In his eight-minute address, which he insisted more than once was not a speech but an apology, Jha held all governments since Independence collectively responsible for the tragedy that unfolded during the pandemic. Excerpts from Jha’s apology in the Upper House, where he sought to become the “voice” of lakhs of people and drew the approval of lawmakers who thumped their desks: ⚫ I’m not speaking here as a member of any political party. Consider me an ordinary citizen of a bereaved republic or a public representative. ⚫ I am speaking here on behalf of lakhs of people who want to speak here. ⚫ This is not a speech. This is an apology to all those citizens whose deaths we didn’t even acknowledge. ⚫ Our faith in this House should make us send a collective apology to all those whose bodies were floating in the Ganga and which we sought to dismiss. ⚫ This is a personal pain. I am not citing any figures. Look for (death) figures in your personal pain. ⚫ There is not one person in this country, in this House, outside this House and in the other House who can say they haven’t lost someone they knew (to Covid). ⚫ I don’t need any figures. Those who have passed on have left behind a living document of our failure. ⚫ I’m not talking about you (those in power). You’ll say nothing has happened in 70 years. I don’t want to go into it. ⚫ This is a collective failure of all the governments since 1947. ⚫ When I step out of this House, I see big advertisements saying: ‘free vaccines, free rations, free treatment’. ⚫ This is a welfare state, isn’t it? When a poor man buys a bar of soap, he is as much a taxpayer as are Adani and Ambani. And you’re telling him ‘free vaccine, free treatment, free ration’. ⚫ No Sir, nothing is free. He has a stake. This welfare state has a commitment. Don’t denigrate, demonise and dwarf him. This is my appeal. ⚫ A lot of big talk is going on about new legislations. Why aren’t you (the government) talking about the right to health? No ifs and buts. A constitutionally guaranteed (right to health) that is linked to right to life is the need of the hour. Then, no hospital can dare to play with the right to life. ⚫ Talk about right to work. A lot is being said about population. Leave demography to the demographers. ⚫ Bring a legislation on right to life and right to work. ⚫ What happened during the one-and-a-half months (during the second wave of the pandemic) feels like a nightmare. The anguished cries for hospitals, ICU beds, medicines.… ⚫ Look for the personal pain in this tragedy. Then alone will you be able to find a solution. Blaming each other won’t achieve anything. This has been going on for long. ⚫ It was said, the governments didn’t fail, the system failed. What’s this system? ⚫ Since childhood, I have been told that behind the system there are people. If the system has failed, whether in Delhi or in village alleys, then the governments there have failed. Don’t blame it on the system because people make the system. ⚫ I’m hurt, I want to wake up myself and you all as well. Floating bodies in the Ganga.… We have witnessed undignified deaths. ⚫ If we are not able correct this (state of affairs), the coming centuries will not pardon us. It doesn’t matter if you put up big thanksgiving advertisements. History should be able to say thank you.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-408
22-07-2021||India||Delhi riots: SC to hear plea against  bail to three student activists||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Thursday the petitions filed by Delhi police challenging the Delhi High Court verdicts granting bail to three student activists in a Delhi riots case. The apex court had on June 18 expressed its displeasure over the high court discussing the entire anti-terror law UAPA in a bail matter and made it clear that the judgments shall not be treated as a precedent and may not be relied upon by any of the parties in any of the proceedings. The top court, which had agreed to hear the appeals filed by police and issued notices to JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita and Jamia Millia Islamia university student Asif Iqbal Tanha seeking their responses, had refused to stay the high court verdicts. The apex court had clarified in its June 18 order that release of these students on bail was not being interfered with at this stage. The pleas would come up for hearing on Thursday before a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta. While hearing the matter last month, the top court had taken note of solicitor-general Tushar Mehta’s submission that the entire Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) has been “turned upside down” by the high court in granting bail in the case and observed that the issue is important and can have pan-India ramifications. Mehta had said that 53 people died and over 700 were injured during the riots which took place at a time when the then US president and other dignitaries were here. The high court had said although the definition of “terrorist act” in Section 15 of the UAPA is wide and somewhat vague, it must partake the essential character of terrorism and the phrase “terrorist act” cannot be permitted to be applied in a “cavalier manner” to criminal acts that squarely fall under the Indian Penal Code. The Delhi police have assailed the verdict, saying the interpretation of high court would weaken the prosecution in terror cases. The police further contended in its appeal that the high court had said the UAPA provisions can only be applied to deal with matters of profound impact on the “Defence of India”, nothing more and nothing less. The high court had on June 15 granted bail to the three student activists saying in an anxiety to suppress dissent the State has blurred the line between right to protest and terrorist activity and if such a mindset gains traction, it would be a “sad day for democracy”. The high court, in three separate judgments, had set aside the trial court’s orders denying bail to these student activists and allowed their appeals by admitting them to regular bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 50,000 each along with two sureties of the like amount. These three student activists were released from jail on June 17. The case relates to the last year’s communal violence in northeast Delhi during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). In its three separate appeals filed in the apex court, the Delhi police have said that the high court’s findings are “perverse and contrary to record” and appeared to be based “more on the social media narrative than the evidence gathered and elaborated in the chargesheet”. Kalita, Narwal and Tanha are accused in four, three and two cases respectively relating to communal riots that broke out on February 24 last year.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-408
22-07-2021||India||Lingayat pontiffs signal BJP to let Yediyurappa carry on till 2023||Dozens of Lingayat pontiffs have been calling on Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yediyurappa in a signal to the BJP to let him run the show till the next Assembly election less than two years away. With several recent developments pointing towards a leadership change, although the party has not officially confirmed it, the seers have come out in support of Yediyurappa, who belongs to the influential Lingayat community that has been the BJP’s mainstay for over two decades. In a state where religious leaders make no attempt to hide their political leanings, more than 30 pontiffs met Yediyurappa on Wednesday in a show of strength. More than 20 other pontiffs had met the veteran leader on Tuesday evening and urged the party not to replace him. The head of the Murugha Mutt, Shivamurthy Muruga Sharanu, is among the seers who want the BJP to allow Yediyurappa to continue till the 2023 elections. “The BJP must not remove him now. He is the man who built the party and opened the first southern gateway for them,” he said. The Lingayat community was formed in the 12th century by reformer-saint Basaveshwara, fondly called Basavanna, as an alternative to Brahminical Hinduism. A minority component called the Veerashaivas, who are often clubbed with the Lingayats, follow Vedic texts. But Lingayats practise the teachings of Basavanna and do not consider themselves as Hindus. The pontiff of the Nidumamidi mutt, Veerabhadra Chennamala Swami, warned the BJP of the damage it could inflict upon itself if Yediyurappa was removed. “The party would suffer badly if it forces him to resign. They should not take any sudden decision to remove him,” he told reporters after meeting Yediyurappa on Wednesday. Siddalinga Swamy of the Siddaganga Mutt urged the BJP to let Yediyurappa complete the rest of his term. “We want him to continue in the interest of the state. He did not say anything when we asked if he was ready to resign.” The seers said they were ready to travel to Delhi to convince the BJP leadership about their demand. Even Lingayat Congress leaders have expressed their support to Yediyurappa with Shamanur Shivasankarappa and M.B. Patil visiting the chief minister on Monday. But state Congress working president Saleem Ahmed explained that Shivasankarappa met Yediyurappa in his capacity as the president of the All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha and Patil in his personal capacity. A BJP functionary told The Telegraph it wouldn’t be easy to remove Yediyurappa. “We have to first convince him to resign and with a proper formula to take care of his sons and supporters,” said the functionary who wished not to be named. While his elder son B.Y. Raghavendra is a Lok Sabha member, younger son and BJP state vice-president B.Y. Vijayendra is Yediyurappa’s Man Friday. The last time Yediyurappa was forced to quit as chief minister was in 2011 when he was arrested over illegal land deals. He then formed the Karnataka Janata Party in 2012 and garnered about 10 per cent votes in the 2013 state polls, decimating the BJP by cutting into its votes.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-409
22-07-2021||India||Covid: Rahul Gandhi blames Centre for the death of millions ||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who has consistently dismissed the official Covid death figures as a “lie”, on Wednesday said 50 lakh people had lost their lives in India during the pandemic so far and held the government responsible for this. Rahul tweeted: “The Truth. Government of India’s wrong decisions during Covid second wave killed 50 lakh of our sisters, brothers, mothers and fathers.” The official Covid death toll in India is over 4.18 lakh. The Congress leader posted the findings of a study by the Centre for Global Development, a Washington research institute, that offers three estimates of the number of casualties in India. Released on Tuesday, the study estimates that between 3.4 and 4.9 million more people than would normally be expected died in the country between January 2020 and June 2021. The study notes that “India lacks an authoritative estimate of the death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic”. “We report excess mortality estimates from three different data sources,” it says. “First, extrapolation of state-level civil registration from seven states suggests 3.4 million excess deaths. Second, applying international estimates of age-specific infection fatality rates (IFR) to Indian seroprevalence data implies a higher toll of around 4 million. Third, our analysis of the Consumer Pyramid Household Survey, a longitudinal panel of over 800,000 individuals across all states, yields an estimate of 4.9 million excess deaths,” the report says. It adds: “Each of these estimates has shortcomings and they also diverge in the pattern of deaths between the two waves of the pandemic. Estimating Covid deaths with statistical confidence may prove elusive. But all estimates suggest that the death toll from the pandemic is likely to be an order of magnitude greater than the official count of 400,000; they also suggest that the first wave was more lethal than is believed.” One of the authors of the study is Arvind Subramanian, former chief economic adviser to the Narendra Modi government. The other authors are Abhishek Anand and Justin Sandefur. Anand is a graduate from Harvard Kennedy School while Sandefur is associated with the Centre for Global Development. Some other studies in the recent past have also suggested that the number of deaths in India is far higher than the official toll. The media has been agog with reports on deaths exceeding the official counts by several times. Regional newspapers have based their reports on blizzards of death certificates issued during the second wave of the pandemic and the overflowing crematoriums and graveyards. Oxygen deaths Rahul also referred to the Centre’s assertion that no deaths had been reported because of oxygen shortage during the second Covid wave. “It wasn’t just oxygen that was scarce. There was and still is a huge shortage of sensitivity and truth,” he tweeted in Hindi. Former finance minister P. Chidambaram also commented on the Centre’s claim on medical oxygen. “Now, it is ‘no reports of deaths due to shortage of oxygen’. Read that carefully. Minister did not say there were ‘no deaths’. He said ‘no reports of deaths’. A blind and deaf government will not be able to see or hear the truth. The government has perfected the art of facing every tragedy with bluff and bluster,” the Congress veteran tweeted, referring to Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya’s response in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. In April and May, visuals and reports of families scrambling to secure oxygen cylinders and of hospitals sending out SOS messages on social media and approaching the courts for urgent oxygen supply were in the newspapers and on television. The Centre told Parliament that the states and Union Territories had not reported any deaths because of oxygen shortage. What it did not say was that the Centre had not sought the data.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-409
22-07-2021||India||Covid: BJP defends government's zero oxygen death claim||The BJP on Wednesday defended the government’s claim that there were no deaths because of oxygen shortage, passing the buck to the states and accusing the Opposition of playing politics. Spokesperson Sambit Patra blamed the Opposition-ruled states, saying if they did not report any deaths by oxygen shortage, the Centre couldn’t be blamed. Like health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday, Patra said the states reported deaths based on a detailed guideline by the Centre. What he did not say was that the Centre’s guideline did not ask for data on deaths caused by oxygen shortage. “The data that was presented in Parliament was given by the states. If the Opposition says the data is not correct, then they should ask their own state governments,” Patra said. He was tasked with defending the government after claims of no oxygen-related deaths led to widespread criticism. “It’s completely false to say no one died due to oxygen shortage. If there was no shortage, why did hospitals go to Delhi High Court with desperate appeals?” Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain asked. Jain accused the central government of trying to suppress deaths due to oxygen crisis in Delhi. “The Kejriwal government constituted an oxygen audit committee to assess deaths due to oxygen shortage and provide compensation, but Modi government through the LG (lieutenant governor) dismissed it to hide the truth,” he added. Delhi had witnessed an acute shortage of oxygen at the peak of the second Covid-19 wave early this summer. As many as 25 Covid patients had died on a single day at Jaipur Golden Hospital in the capital after the facility ran out of medical oxygen. Patra sought to deny the oxygen-related deaths. He claimed that Delhi High Court had ordered a probe into the deaths and that a committee formed by the Kejriwal government had in its report made “no mention of oxygen shortage”. He accused the Delhi government of playing politics and asked why the committee constituted by them couldn’t ascertain any oxygen-related deaths in the Jaipur Golden Hospital case. Hitting out at Rahul Gandhi, Patra said no deaths due to oxygen crisis had been reported by any Congress-ruled state. “Rahul Gandhi is acting like a Twitter troll, spreading lies and misinformation. Why states like Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh didn’t report any deaths due to oxygen shortage?” he asked. Along with Rahul and the Delhi government, Shiv Sena MP and spokesperson Sanjay Raut slammed the Centre’s claim. “I am speechless. How would families who have lost their loved ones due to the shortage of medical oxygen feel after listening to this? These families should file a case against the government,” Raut said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-409
22-07-2021||India||Bihar: Hint of imminent change of guard in RJD and JDU||A churning in Lalu Prasad’s RJD and chief minister Nitish Kumar’s JDU has indicated an imminent change of guard in the two largest parties of Bihar. While Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu is considering abdicating in favour of his younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, Union minister R.C.P. Singh could lose the position of Janata Dal United national president. These moves will have wide-ranging political ramifications, and will also decide the trajectory of Bihar politics in the coming months. The upheaval started in the RJD, the largest single party in the legislative Assembly with 75 out of total 243 seats, earlier this month when its state unit president and veteran politician Jagadanand Singh, 77, tendered his resignation apparently on health grounds. A few senior party leaders said that he took the step after becoming annoyed by the continuous barbs of Lalu’s eldest son and Hasanpur MLA Tej Pratap Yadav. Though RJD national president Lalu has not accepted the resignation so far, sources say that Jagadanand is quite adamant about leaving the post. This has led to a hunt for his successor. There are also talks that Lalu wants to abdicate on the grounds of poor health in favour of Tejashwi, who successfully led the party in the 2020 Assembly elections. The RJD chief is diabetic and is suffering from heart and kidney-related ailments. The deliberations on these issues are currently going on between Lalu, Jagadanand, Tejashwi at the house of Rajya Sabha member and Lalu’s eldest daughter Misa Bharti in Delhi. Rabri Devi is also present there. Most of the RJD leaders are tightlipped on the two sensitive issues that could impact the future of the party. “Though no decision has been conveyed to us so far, it is a well-known thing that Tejashwi has always wanted to become the national president of the party because it will give him more grip on it. This will come handy if a power struggle breaks out with his siblings Misa Bharti and Tej Pratap. Moreover, he has proved himself to be a worthy politician who could succeed Lalu,” a former RJD MP told The Telegraph on the condition of anonymity. Another senior RJD leader pointed out that Tejashwi was in favour of a young and energetic person as the state unit president, who could understand and readily accept his directions, and be proficient in the use of technology, especially mobile phones, social media, computers. Jagadanand has been a failure on these fronts. “Former ministers Shyam Rajak and Alok Mehta are being considered along with a couple of Yadav legislators. There are indications of Tej Pratap Yadav also being in the race. Lalu, known as a doting father, could accommodate him (Tej Pratap) to stop any power struggle breaking out in the family, but it will spell doom for the party because he is not accepted as a serious politician,” the RJD leader said. However, RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari rejected all speculation over a change in the leadership of the party. “Tejashwi is lucky that his father is there with his experience to guide him and to give suitable suggestions. The media has created speculation about upcoming leadership changes. There is no doubt that he (Tejashwi) is the leader of the party, but right now there is no need for him for this (to become RJD national president),” Shivanand said. A leadership change in the ruling JDU is also being smelled round the corner as the party is gearing up for its national executive in Delhi on July 31. The issue emerged in full force after present JDU national president R.C.P. Singh became a cabinet minister in the NDA government at the Centre, leaving other hopefuls high and dry. His move created a controversy because Nitish had rejected a similar offer to his party to join the government at the Centre in 2019. Senior leaders in party, including Nitish, washed their hands off the issue by asserting that Singh was solely responsible for the decision. Coupled with it is the fact that the JDU performed poorly in the 2020 Assembly polls by winning just 43 seats out of 115 it contested, thereby slipping to the third position in the state. “Singh, a former bureaucrat, has not been able to come out of his bureaucratic mode of functioning. He is no worthwhile political experience and is no leader of the masses. Nitish is now trying hard to consolidate and expand the vote base of the party. This is the reason that he has asked leaders like Upendra Kushwaha and Umesh Kushwaha to tour the state,” a top JDU leader said. “It won’t be a surprise in this scenario if Nitish again takes the reign of the party in his own hands or appoints Upendra or Munger MP Lalan Singh as the national president of the party. Appointing Lalan will assuage his feelings of having been left out in the race for Union cabinet berth. It will also send a message that ours is an all-inclusive party,” the JDU leader added. Sources in the JDU asserted that Nitish is already planning with his eyes on the 2024 general elections, and will go for leadership changes in the party accordingly.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-409
22-07-2021||India||Centre seeks four weeks’ time on ex gratia to kin of Covid dead||The Centre has informed the Supreme Court that the direction to make ex gratia payments to the families of the Covid dead is under “active consideration” and sought an additional four weeks’ time to come out with “comprehensive and robust guidelines”. The apex court had ruled on June 30 that the relatives of patients killed by Covid would have to be paid ex gratia under a central law, brushing aside the Narendra Modi government’s contention that such payouts were not mandatory. But the court had declined to fix the amount at Rs 4 lakh each, which the petitioners had sought on the basis of central guidelines issued in 2015 for disaster victims’ survivors. The court had asked the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to decide the size of the payment within six weeks. In an affidavit filed before the top court on Tuesday, the Centre pleaded that it wanted to go for an “in-depth examination” of the matter as any “accelerated formulation” of the ex gratia amount would lead to “undesirable results”. Covid has officially claimed over 4.18 lakh lives in India so far. The court had on June 30 also directed the government to simplify the procedure for issuing death certificates to avoid unnecessary harassment of the claimants. In its affidavit filed through standing counsel B.V. Balram Das, the Centre said on Wednesday: “The applicant respectfully submits that the exercise to frame appropriate guidelines for payment of ex gratia to the victims of the Covid-19 disaster under Section 12(iii) of the DMA (Disaster Management Act) is in active consideration of the NDMA and going on. “It is submitted that this exercise, though at an active advanced stage, requires a little more in-depth examination before the same is finalised and implemented. Any accelerated formulation, in the respectful submission of the applicant, may result in undesirable results.” The affidavit added: “In view of the aforesaid, the applicant… is respectfully praying that this Hon’ble Court, in the interest of justice, be pleased to extend the time of six weeks granted to the applicant… to frame guidelines as enumerated in para 16(1) of the judgment dated 30.06.2021 by another four weeks so as to enable the NDMA to come out with comprehensive and robust guidelines. The present application is made bonafide and in the interest of justice.” Unlike compensation, ex gratia is an amount given as a succour to the affected or kin to tide over a sudden tragedy. The court had passed the directions while dealing with a batch of petitions filed by advocates Reepak Kansal and Gaurav Kumar Bansal and a couple of other interveners pleading for a minimum Rs 4 lakh ex gratia to the kin of all persons who had died on account of the pandemic.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-409
