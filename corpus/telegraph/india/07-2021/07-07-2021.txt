07-07-2021||India||Cabinet reshuffle: List of new ministers||Among the 36 new faces in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's council of ministers, eight are lawyers, four are doctors, two are former IAS officers and four MBA degree holders, besides several engineers, making it an eclectic mix of professionals. Apart from addressing regional and community aspirations, the focus it seems has been on bringing in highly qualified members and those with experience of administration in states in an effort to reboot the government midway in its term. Ashwini Vaishnaw, who has been given charge of the Railways Ministry besides Communication and Electronics and Information Technology, is a former IAS officer of the 1994 batch. The 50-year-old Rajya Sabha MP for Odisha also has an MBA from Wharton School, Pennysylvania University and MTech from IIT Kanpur. During his tenure, he handled important responsibilities for over 15 years and was particularly known for his contribution to the PPP framework in infrastructure. He has held leadership roles across major global companies such as General Electric and Siemens. Among the new faces with management skills is former Congress leader and now BJP Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya M Scindia who is serving his fifth term as a parliamentarian. He has been allocated Civil Aviation portfolio, which was once held by his father Madhavrao Scindia. He has an MBA from Stanford University and BA from Harvard University. Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a Rajya Sabha MP for Karnataka who is serving his third term, has an MTech in Computer Science from Illinois Institute of Technology, along with Advanced Management Program from Harvard University. Another IAS officer who has made it to the council of ministers is Ramchandra Prasad Singh, a Rajya Sabha MP for Bihar serving his second term as MP. He is the new Steel minister An alumnus of the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Singh is a retired IAS officer of the 1984 batch, having served over 25 years across various capacities and domains. He holds an MA in International Relations. Bhagwanth Khuba, a Lok Sabha MP for Bidar in Karnataka, holds a BTech degree in Mechanical Engineering. Modi's council of ministers also has cardiologists, gynaecologists, surgeons and general practitioners. Subhas Sarkar, a first-time Lok Sabha MP for Bankura in West Bengal is a gynaecologist and board member of AIIMS Kalyani. He holds an MBBS degree from Calcutta University. Another doctor in the fold with expertise in multiple fields of medicine, Bhagwat Kishanrao Karad is a Rajya Sabha MP for Maharashtra, serving his first term as MP. He runs Dr Karad Multi Specialty Hospital and Research Center in Aurangabad and holds MBBS, MS (General Surgery), MCh (Pediatric Surgery), and FCPS (General Surgery) degrees. With a three-decade-long career as a cardiologist and professor of medicine in Gujarat, Munjapara Mahendrabhai, a Lok Sabha MP for Surendranagar, will join Modi's council of ministers as a first time MP. He holds an MD in General Medicine and Therapeutics. Another first-time MP, Bharati Pravin Pawar from Dindori in Maharashtra was a medical practitioner before joining politics. She holds an MBBS degree in Surgery from NDMVPS Medical College, Nashik. Legal eagles seem to dominate the group of newcomers with as many as eight having LLB degrees. These include Meenakshi Lekhi, a Lok Sabha MP for New Delhi who is still practising in Supreme Court. Sarbananda Sonowal, a two Lok Sabha MP from Assam who served as its chief minister from 2016-21, has an LLB from Guwahati University. He will be the new Ports and Shipping minister besides holding charge of AYUSH Ministry. L Murugan, the BJP Tamil Nadu chief and another new inductee had practised law at Madras High Court for 15 years before joining public life full-time. He holds an LLM and Ph.D. in law from Madras University. The others with law degrees include Bhupender Yadav, a Rajya Sabha MP for Rajasthan, serving his second term. Known for his leadership across many Parliamentary Committees, Yadav, before beginning his political career, was an advocate in the Supreme Court and also served as government counsel for important Commissions. He has an LLB from Government College, Ajmer Rajasthan. First-time MP from Nainital, Ajay Bhatt practiced as a lawyer in Ranikhet. Fifth term MPs, Satya Pal Singh Baghel and Bhanu Pratap Singh Verma, also have an LLB degree.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-460
07-07-2021||India||Vardhan, Javadekar and Prasad out in Afternoon of Long Knives ||Everyone knew it was coming. But till the very last minute, nobody had a hint of the extent of the carnage that was about to take place as Prime Minister Narendra Modi axed a dozen ministers including health minister Harsh Vardhan and headline-hogging figures like Prakash Javadekar and Ravi Shankar Prasad. Vardhan is seen as the sacrificial lamb for the government’s failure to contain the catastrophic second wave pandemic. while the exits of Javadekar and Prasad come amid the ongoing Twitter standoff and a clash with media houses. By nighttime, the critics were gathering to roast Modi for making a hash of handing out portfolios with one newcomer, Ashwani Vaishnaw, getting a bizarre mix of Railways, telecommunications, electronics and information technology. Vaishnaw, a newcomer to the Modi cabinet, is a former IAS officer who was a key figure in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee PMO, and holds an MBA from Wharton and an MTech from IIT Kanpur. Another key takeaway from the shuffle is the downward slide of Piyush Goyal who loses the key Railways portfolio. Once considered a shining star, he has been losing ground with his ill-disguised ambition of becoming the finance minister. Goyal upset his mentor Arun Jaitley when he took charge of finance during Jaitley’s medical leave. Since then, it has been a downhill journey for him. In the swearing-in ceremony of the Modi government Version 2, he dramatically lost rank in the protocol order, being demoted to minister of commerce. Less of a surprise was the downfall of Vardhan because it has been clear for some time that he has been given the role as the fall guy for the government’s failure to control the devastating second Covid-19 wave.  “Poor Dr Harsh Vardhan, a good man has been made a scapegoat for monumental failures at the highest level — nowhere else,” tweeted Congress MP Jairam Ramesh. “The resignations of the Union Health Minister and the Minister of State, Health is a candid confession that the Modi government has utterly failed in managing the pandemic,” tweeted senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram. Vardhan has now been replaced in health and family welfare by Gujarat MP Mansukh Mandaviya. In Gujarat, Mandaviya has been called the Minister for Padayatras because of the long walks he undertakes around the state for good causes. He’s an animal lover who studied veterinary sciences and later also studied political science. He’s a Rajya Sabha member. In total, Modi booted out 12 ministers, including seven of cabinet rank, in his first ministerial overhaul since his sweeping 2019 win. They handed in their resignations in what was quickly dubbed the Afternoon of the Long Knives.  A total of 43 ministers, including 36 new members, were sworn into the Council of Ministers as part of of the mega-shakeup. Seven were promoted. The Modi government, which used to criticise the previous Congress government for its jumbo ministerial team now has 30 cabinet ministers, up from 21. Totally there are now 77 ministers -- close to the maximum limit of 81. “In a clear sign that the government has its eyes on the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, new cabinet includes seven ministers from UP. “We will continue working to fulfil aspirations of the people and build a strong and prosperous India," Modi said after the swearing-in ceremony. Congress said the sheer size of the shakeup was an admission by the Modi government that it had massively underperformed. The promotion of Anurag Thakur to the crucial Information & Broadcasting portfolio has evoked mixed reactions. At one level, he’s a polished performer in person. But he was banned from campaigning for 72 hours for declaring “shoot the traitors” during the Delhi elections. In his new job, he’ll have to conduct delicate negotiations with the media industry which is up in arms about proposals dealing with online news portals. Thakur will also supervise the efforts of India’s star athletes at the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. Also, Kiran Rijuju, a lawyer, has been given the extremely crucial Law & Justice portfolio, a step up from his role as minister of state for youth, sports and minority affairs. Jyotiraditya Scindia, who’s new to the world of saffron, has been rewarded for his role in ousting the Madhya Pradesh Congress government with the highflying but temporarily grounded during the pandemic Civil Aviation portfolio. Scindia will get the knotty job of supervising the Air India sale and breathing life back into the aviation industry which has been pummelled by the pandemic. The civil aviation ministry was once held by his father, Madhavrao Scindia ,who died in a 2001 plane crash. Hardeep Singh Puri, who was handling the Ministry of Civil Aviation as a junior minister, will now go on promotion and look after the stuff that goes into aeroplanes at the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. He will continue to look after the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs but as a full-fledged cabinet minister. Puri gets the unenviable task of shepherding through the highly controversial Central Vista project which is bound to earn him constant flak. New to the government is another senior BJP figure, Bhupendra Yadav, who is taking over the critical Environment and Climate Change Ministry and also the Ministry of Labour and Employment. Yadav has been a key backroom BJP strategist. Modi didn’t make any changes in the core ministries of defence, external affairs, home and finance, though External Affairs now gets three junior ministers including lawyer Meenakshi Lekhi. Amit Shah remains home minister but has also been named to head the new Ministry of Cooperation. The ministry will promote a cooperative-based economic development model as part of Modi’s goal of creating “Sahkar se Samriddhi” -- prosperity through cooperatives, according to a government statement. One little-noticed minor casualty was Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari who loses the shipping portfolio. Gadkari has been stuck in the same ministry for the last seven years and while he won’t be totally edged out because of his strong Nagpur connections, it’s clear he shouldn’t expect a promotion while Modi is the prime minister. The reshuffle showed that the BJP has paid particular attention to Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra and that it has also attempted extremely delicate caste engineering. There are seven ministers from Uttar Pradesh and, noticeably, they each represent key regions in the state. Reflecting caste sensibilities, in Gujarat, for instance, it’s brought in three Patels and three OBCs. Unusually, the government also released information about the caste and subcastes of the new ministers who are being brought in, indicating considerable thought had been given to this issue even though the national elections are almost three years away. The reshuffle has reduced the average age of the council of ministers to 58 from 61. The youngest new minister is Nisith Pramanik, 35, from Cooch Behar. The Modi government has faced considerable setbacks since returning to power. Most importantly, it has been accused of failing to tackle the pandemic properly and get enough vaccines ready on time. Besides that, it’s also been accused of mismanaging the economy even before the pandemic struck. Four ministers have been inducted from Bengal, meanwhile, indicating that the BJP has not given up on the state even after its recent defeat in the assembly elections. The BJP had done well in the assembly constituencies of the ministers who have been inducted. By contrast, the party fared poorly in the assembly constituencies represented by Babool Supriyo who’s been dropped.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-460
07-07-2021||India||Farmers gear up for protest against fuel price hike||Large contingents of farmers have started arriving at protest sites in preparation for their agitation Thursday against fuel price hike, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) said on Wednesday. "At the call of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, protests will be organised across India tomorrow (July 8) from 10 am to 12 noon for two hours against the hike in diesel, petrol and cooking gas prices," the umbrella body of over 40 farm unions said. The protestors will reach designated public locations with any means of transport including scooters, motorcycles, tractors, cars, buses, trucks and also with empty gas cylinders, it said. On Wednesday, the petrol prices in Delhi as well as Kolkata crossed the Rs 100 a litre mark. The SKM has demanded that the fuel prices be halved with immediate effect. It has also appealed to the protestors to keep the demonstration peaceful and on the roadside, without blocking any pathways. This is an issue that affects every section of the society, and SKM appeals that farmers, labourers, youth, students, women, employees, shopkeepers, transporters, traders and others be part of these protests everywhere, the body said. The SKM has also planned fresh rounds of protests during the monsoon session of the parliament scheduled later this month, when 200 protestors will agitate everyday outside the Parliament building reiterating their demands of repealing the three farm laws and a legal guarantee for Minimum Support price (MSP). Over the last seven months, thousands of farmers from different parts of the country have been protesting at Delhi borders against the new farm laws which, they claim, will do away with the MSP system and leave them at the mercy of big corporations. The government, however, has been protecting the laws as major agricultural reforms.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-461
07-07-2021||India||Cabinet reshuffle: Eye on 2022 polls, seven new ministers from UP||Seven ministers from Uttar Pradesh were sworn in at Rashtrapati Bhavan Wednesday, all picked with an eye on next year's assembly polls in the state. Of the seven newly inducted ministers from UP, Anupriya Patel heads BJP ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) and was a minister in the first Narendra Modi government. The rest are from the BJP. Anupriya Patel, Pankaj Chaudhary and B L Verma are from the Other Backward Classes, which BJP leader in UP say make up 50 per cent of voters in the state. Three others -- Kaushal Kishore, Bhanu Pratap Singh Verma and S P Singh Baghel -- are from the Scheduled Castes category. Ajay Kumar is the lone Brahmin in this batch of ministers from the state. There was speculation earlier that Jitin Prasada, a Brahmin face of the Congress who recently joined the BJP, may be given a ministerial berth. But with Ajay Kumar, the state's Terai region also gets representation. Barring Rajya Sabha MP B L Verma, the new ministers are from the Lok Sabha. A regional balance is maintained. Anupriya Patel (Mirzapur) and Pankaj Chaudhary (Maharajganj) are from eastern Uttar Pradesh. From western UP, Baghel represents Agra and Rajya Sabha MP B L Verma hails from Budaun. Bhanu Pratap Singh Verma, who represents Jalaun is from the Bundelkhand region. Ajay Kumar represents Khiri parliamentary constituency in Terai and Kaushal Kishore is from Mohanlalganj, adjacent to capital Lucknow. BJP leaders say that the OBCs constitute about 50 per cent of the voters in the state and the Scheduled Castes make up 20 per cent. Anupriya Patel, a minister of state at the Centre from 2016 to 2019, has been jockeying for a separate ministry to solve problems faced by the OBCs.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-461
07-07-2021||India||Delhi riots: Supreme Court to deliver verdict on Facebook India VP Ajit Mohan's summons plea||The Supreme Court is scheduled to deliver its verdict on Thursday on a plea filed by Facebook India Vice President and MD Ajit Mohan and others challenging the summons issued by Delhi Assembly's Peace and Harmony committee for failing to appear before it as witness in connection with the north-east Delhi riots matter. A bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy had on February 24 reserved its verdict on the plea. During the arguments before the apex court, Mohan's counsel had argued that right to silence is a virtue in present noisy times and the assembly has no legislative power to set up a panel to examine the issue of peace and harmony. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Facebook official, had said that setting up of the peace panel was not the core function of Delhi assembly as the law and order issue fell under the domain of the Centre in the national capital. Senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, representing the panel of the assembly, had said that the assembly has the power to summon. However, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had opposed the submission of the panel of the assembly saying that law and order squarely fell under the domain of the Delhi Police which is accountable to the Central government. Earlier in December last year, the Peace and Harmony committee had moved the top court seeking to intervene in the plea filed by Mohan and others. On October 15 last year, the Centre had told the top court that proceedings of the Peace and Harmony committee is without jurisdiction as the issue pertained to law and order. The apex court had said that its September 23 order asking the assembly's panel not to take any coercive action against Mohan, would continue till further orders. The plea filed by Mohan, Facebook India Online Services Pvt Ltd and Facebook Inc has contended that the committee lacks power to summon or hold petitioners in breach of its privileges for failing to appear and it was exceeding its constitutional limits. They have challenged the September 10 and 18 last year notices issued by the committee that sought Mohan's presence before the panel which is probing the Delhi riots in February and Facebook's role in spread of alleged hate speeches. The Delhi Assembly had said that no coercive action has been taken against Mohan and he was only summoned by its committee to appear as witness in connection with north-east Delhi riots. In an affidavit filed in the top court, the Delhi Assembly had said that Mohan has not been issued any summons for breach of privilege.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-461
07-07-2021||India||Covid: Delhi HC seeks Centre’s reply on setting up liquid oxygen buffer||The Delhi High Court Wednesday sought the Centre's response on the issue of setting up buffer stock of liquid medical oxygen in the national capital to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, even as the AAP government submitted that it has 419 metric tonnes of LMO. A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh directed the Centre to positively respond within one week on the steps taken by it in terms of the Supreme Court's April 30 order asking it to create buffer stock of LMO, as it is pending for a long time. The court was informed by the Delhi government counsel that it has 419 metric tonne LMO in buffer as of now and it will be maintained and that the facility is being created at state hospital. The court also directed the Delhi government to file a status report on the issue of buffer stock of oxygen and give details of the location of different storage tanks and how much quantity of the LMO is being stored there. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, submitted that the LMO stock was being stored with the oxygen suppliers, later it would be transported here. The court observed that if the Delhi government has storage facility, it should be used not to store the oxygen so that in case of a surge in COVID-19 cases, it would be readily available. There might be a possibility that you have the capacity to store but you would not get the oxygen quantity when you need it and your storage tanks will be empty. At the time of crisis, every state will run for oxygen and they you will find it difficult to get, the bench said. You go by our experience of April and May. You had issues of transportation, infrastructure, no storage facility. These were the bottlenecks.., it said, and asked the government whether the issue was scientifically examined. The court also asked the Centre to file a status report in response to recommendations made by IIT Delhi on oxygen storage in the national capital in which the institution has proposes certain steps to be taken by the central government. It also asked the Centre and Delhi government to file reports within a week giving data of usage of transportation and accommodation facilities, extended by them to the health workers. During the hearing, the court was informed by the amicus curiae and senior advocate Raj Shekhar Rao that steps have been taken by the Centre on fixing of prices of oxygen concentrators, which were being sold at exorbitant rates during the second wave of the COVID-19. The court asked the Centre to place on record the notification on fixing MRP of oxygen concentrators and capped trade margin on the prices.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-461

07-07-2021||India||Cabinet reshuffle means distribution of spoils of power: Congress||Ahead of a major reshuffle of the Union Council of Ministers, the Congress on Wednesday said the exercise was not driven by performance or governance but meant for "distribution of the spoils of power" and "adjustment" of defectors. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said if the cabinet expansion was to be done on the basis of performance then the prime minister should have been the first one to be removed for his failures in providing governance. He also said the finance minister, home minister and the defence minister too should have been axed as they failed in their respective roles. “The present cabinet expansion is not performance or governance driven, but is a distribution of spoils of power and defectors adjustment programme,” he told reporters. “Overall, this cabinet expansion is not a performance appraisal. It is only a means of serving the interests of their allies and not for the country. But when will there be an appraisal of PM Modi's performance who brought the nation to the brink of poverty after turning away from its responsibility in the Corona epidemic,” he asked. If performance and governance were the criteria then the first person to be sacked should be Modi as he has brought the government and the entire country to a standstill, he said. “Progress and peace and harmony have been thrown into the dustbin of history and the present prime minister would be remembered as an autocrat, who decimated India's economy, who ensured India was pushed into an abyss of unemployment and who ensured that India's strength as the super power of the 21st century was grossly undermined," the Congress leader alleged. Surjewala also said if performance and governance were the criteria, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman too should be sacked, citing their failures to tackle the border standoff with China in eastern Ladakh, the continued problems of naxalism and terrorism and rising cases of mob lynching, and the poor economic condition.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-461
07-07-2021||India||Modi’s cabinet overhaul: 43 ministers sworn in||In a major overhaul, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday brought in Sarbananda Sonowal, Narayan Rane and Jyotiraditya Scindia in the Cabinet while dropping as many as 12 ministers including Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, IT and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and I&B Minister Prakash Javadekar. Fifteen Cabinet ministers and 28 ministers of state, comprising new faces and those elevated, were sworn in at a ceremony held in the Darbar Hall of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. While most of the members took oath in Hindi, a few of them took it in English. This is the first reshuffle in the Council of Ministers by Prime Minister Modi since he assumed charge for a second term in May 2019. An extensive and protracted review was carried out by Modi and the BJP top brass through a series of meetings with ministers ahead of Wednesday's big exercise. These meetings were also held in the wake of widespread criticism of the Central government's handling of the COVID crisis. But the exits of IT and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, health minister Harsh Vardhan and environment minister Prakash Javadekar stood out. The axe fell on Vardhan after months of firefighting as the second surge of Covid engulfed the nation, exposing its inadequate health infrastructure. Cities ran out of oxygen and hospital beds and burning pyres at crematoriums and bodies floating in rivers became defining images of an unprecedented national crisis. Javadekar was among the chief spokespersons of the government, a role he has performed for years. Ravi Shankar Prasad's resignation was a shock as he was seen to be in the core team of the government's troubleshooters. Rane, 69, a Rajya Sabha MP and a former Maharashtra chief minister, was the first to take oath. After Rane, Sonowal, former Assam chief minister, took oath in English. The 58-year-old leader has earlier served as Union Minister of State (Independent charge) for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship; and Sports and Youth Affairs under Prime Minister Modi Congress-turned-BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, a Rajya Sabha MP from Madhya Pradesh, also took oath as a Cabinet minister. The 50-year-old leader was Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Power and Union Minister of State for Commerce & Communications in the earlier UPA government. Lok Sabha MP from Tikamgarh in Madhya Pradesh Virendra Kumar, Rajya Sabha MP from Odisha Ashwini Vaishnaw, Rajya Sabha MP from Bihar and JD(U) leader R C P Singh, Lok Sabha MP from Bihar's Hajipur Pashupati Kumar Paras, were also sworn-in as Cabinet ministers. Kiren Rijiju, R K Singh, Hardeep Singh Puri, Mansukh Mandaviya, Parshottam Rupala, G Kishan Reddy and Anurag Thakur were elevated to the Cabinet level. Bhupendra Yadav, who has been serving in the BJP organisation as a general secretary, was also sworn-in as a Cabinet minister. As many as 28 ministers of state took oath including seven from Uttar Pradesh which goes to polls next year with the BJP seeking a second term there. Pankaj Choudhary, Anupriya Patel, Bhanu Pratap Singh Verma, Kaushal Kishore, S P S Baghel and Ajay Kumar-- all Lok Sabha MPs from Uttar Pradesh -- took oath as new Union Ministers of State. B L Verma, a Rajya Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh, was also sworn-in as a Minister of State. Rajeev Chandrasekhar and Shobha Karandlaje, MPs from Karnataka; Darshana Vikram Jardosh from Gujarat; New Delhi Lok Sabha MP Meenakashi Lekhi; Annpurna Devi (Jharkhand), A Narayanaswamy (Karnataka); Ajay Bhatt (Uttarakhand), Chauhan Devusinh (Gujarat), were also sworn in as MoS. Others who took oath as Ministers of State at the ceremony were Bhagwanth Khuba (Karnataka); Kapil Moreshwar Patil (Maharashtra); Pratima Bhoumik (Tripura); Subhas Sarkar (West Bengal); Bhagwat Kishanrao Karad (Maharashtra); Rajkumar Ranjan Singh (Manipur); MPs Bharati Pawar (Maharashtra), Bishweswar Tudu (Odisha) and Shantanu Thakur (West Bengal) Munjapara Mahendrabhai (Gujarat), John Barla and Nisith Pramanik (West Bengal); and BJP's Tamil Nadu state president L Murugan. At least 16 entrants to the Council of Ministers are first time MPs. Earlier, four senior Union ministers -- Prasad, Javadekar, Vardhan and Education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal "Nishank" -- were among 12 ministers who resigned on Wednesday ahead of the cabinet reshuffle. Besides these four, Chemicals and Fertilisers Minister D V Sadananda Gowda, Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar, Minister of State for Education Sanjay Dhotre, Minister of State for Women and Child Development Debasree Chaudhuri, Minister of State for Jal Shakti Rattan Lal Kataria and Minister of State for Environment Babul Supriyo also resigned. Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thaawarchand Gehlot had resigned after he was made Governor of Karnataka on Tuesday. Prasad and Javadekar, who had been the face of Cabinet briefings announcing key Cabinet decisions on several occasions in the past few years, were present at the swearing-in ceremony here after resigning as ministers. Vardhan was also present at the ceremony. The average age of the new council of ministers has reduced to 58 years from 61 years previously. Nisith Pramanik (35), the Lok Sabha MP from West Bengal's Cooch Behar, is the youngest minister to be sworn in, while the oldest member in the council of ministers is 72-year-old Som Parkash.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-461
07-07-2021||India||TRP scam: Mumbai court grants anticipatory bail to three accused||A Mumbai sessions court on Wednesday granted anticipatory bail to three Republic TV employees in connection with the alleged Television Rating Points (TRP) rigging scam. The three employees - Shivendu Mulherkar, Ranjit Walter and Sivasubramaniyam Sundaram - had filed their pleas before the court in November-December last year, their lawyer Vikram Kamath said. The court heard the pleas on Monday, he said. On Wednesday, Additional Sessions Judge A D Deo allowed the anticipatory bail applications of the three employees, their lawyer said. They had submitted before the court there was no ground against them (for arrest) and they were not named in the FIR registered in the case. Subsequently, a charge sheet was filed and they were named as accused. So, whatever material was there, it was before the court. Hence, their custodial interrogation was not required, Kamath had argued. In a supplementary charge sheet filed in the case in June this year, the Mumbai police had named the three as accused, along with senior journalist and Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami. The alleged fake TRP scam came to light in October last year when ratings agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint through Hansa Research Group (HRG), alleging that certain television channels were rigging TRP numbers. The HRG had been tasked with installing barometers for recording channel viewership data at sample households. Police had arrested about dozens of people, including top officials of the BARC and Republic TV. Most of them are currently out on bail.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-461
07-07-2021||India||Delhi HC asks Centre to file status report on availability of Black Fungus drug||The Delhi High Court Wednesday asked the Centre to file a status report on availability of Liposomal Amphotericin B, used for treating patients of black fungus which primarily affects those who have recovered from Covid-19. A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh asked the Centre to also indicate the status of quantities of Liposomal Amphotericin B actually imported and the outstanding supplies and also its domestic production. The report shall be filed by the Central government within a week, the court said. The court inquired whether there is any shortage of the medicine currently, to which the amicus curiae submitted that there is no shortage currently as the number of patients have gone down. But the issue is whether the medicine would be available in sufficient quantity when the need would arise, he said. The bench observed, “if we are preparing for the third wave of Covid-19, we need to see the arrangement for it”. The court also asked the government to deal with the issues in terms of urgency and first take up the aspects which are more urgent, like availability of medicines and buffer stock of oxygen. The court was informed by the Centre's counsel that presently there are 17,000 cases of black fungus in the country, which have come down from 23-24,000. Regarding Remdesivir, which was being used in Covid-19 treatment, the high court asked the Centre to file status report indicating whether export of the medicine has started and also the status of its stock. The court also asked the Centre to inform if stock of the medicine which was manufactured for export purposes is now permitted to be sold in the domestic market. Earlier, exports of Remdesivir were stopped by the Centre and the high court had questioned the holding of exports of the medicine at the ports if it cannot be diverted to the domestic market. The court was informed that the criteria for prioritising patients for administering Liposomal Amphotericin B for treating mucormycosis (Black Fungus) was young patients and those in whom surgical debridement is not possible or incomplete. The issue of shortage of the medicine for treating black fungus was raised by advocate Rakesh Malhotra who said these cases are rising. According to the Union Health Ministry, mucormycosis or black fungus is a complication caused by a fungal infection. People catch mucormycosis by coming in contact with the fungal spores in the environment. The disease is being detected among patients who are recovering or have recovered from Covid-19.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-461
07-07-2021||India||File status reports on filling up of posts, SC tells states||The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the Centre and states to file status reports in four weeks on compliance with its 2019 verdict for time-bound filling up of posts of Information Commissioners at CIC and state panels under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. In an important verdict on transparency law, the apex court had come out with a slew of directions on February 15 and ordered that the selection process to fill vacancies at the Central Information Commission (CIC) and State Information Commissions (SICs) should begin two months before they arise and the search committee should select people of eminence from various fields and not be limited to bureaucrats. A bench of justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari noted that the Centre's last status report on compliance was filed over a year ago and asked Additional Solicitor General Madhvi Divan to file a fresh one on the status of vacancies, the steps taken to fill them and observance of other directions. "Respondents, Union of India and states, are directed to file the latest status and compliance reports within four weeks from today. List after four weeks... Petitioner (RTI activist Anjali Bhadwaj) is also permitted to file an additional affidavit in the meantime," the bench said in its order. The top court also permitted lawyer Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the activist, to file additional affidavit in the case after he sought a direction that the Centre be asked to file the dissent note of Leader of Opposition Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury who was part of the appointment panel which includes the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. He said Chowdhury, during the meeting of the selection committee, had raised the issue of not being provided with the selection criteria for the CIC and ICs. Bhushan also said that the Centre should be directed to put on record the criteria for shortlisting of candidates for appointment as CIC and ICs and information such as the existing vacancies and the names of persons who had applied for the posts. The top court was hearing the plea of the RTI activist seeking implementation of the 2019 verdict on appointments to the CIC and SICs under the Act. Bhardwaj has also sought a direction to government authorities on implementation of the top court's order asking them to appoint information commissioners. At the outset, Bhushan said an application has been filed for filling up of vacancies in CIC and SICs. Directions were given in 2020 that these posts need to be filled up well in time. Another important direction was issued. The court had deprecated the practice of selecting only bureaucrats or having a selection committee made up only of bureaucrats, he said. He said there have been vacancies in SICs in states like Maharashtra, Odisha, Karnataka and West Bengal and there was a need to implement the directions of this court in entirety. He alleged that around 75,000 and 36,000 cases under RTI are pending adjudication in Maharashtra SIC and the CIC respectively and the efforts have been made to render the RTI legislation ineffective. Seeking selection criteria on record, Bhushan alleged that a bogus journalist has been appointed in the CIC and moreover, only bureaucrats are being considered for such appointments. The ASG opposed the submissions and term bogus journalist used by Bhushan and asked him to file an affidavit to this effect for soliciting a response from the Centre. They cannot make accusations or call the members bogus journalists. The maximum strength is up to 10 members. That doesn't mean that there are vacancies. Right now we have 7 members, the law officer said. The apex court, in 2019, had said selection of information officers for the CIC and SICs should include people of eminence from various fields and not be limited to bureaucrats, a "bias" which is "writ large" in the current selection process. It had said Parliament intended persons of eminence in public life be taken as CIC as well ICs but a "strange phenomenon is happening", that those persons who have been selected belong to only one category which is public service. It had also said that to bring transparency in selection of ICs, states should adopt the Centre's process in which it uploads on the website the names of the Search Committee, the names of the candidates who have been shortlisted as well as the criteria followed for selection. The top court had then directed the Centre and eight states -- Bengal, Orissa, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Nagaland, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka -- to fill up the vacancies without any delay within a period of one to six months.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-461
07-07-2021||India||India cautions UN on attempts to divide terrorism into different terminologies||India has cautioned that 20 years after the 9/11 terror attacks, there are attempts again to divide terrorism into different terminologies such as violent nationalism and right wing extremism, asserting that the world should not return to the era of your terrorists and my terrorists but fight the scourge collectively. Participating in the UN General Assembly debate on adoption of resolution on 7th Review of Global Counter Terrorism Strategy (GCTS) on Tuesday, India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador T S Tirumurti said that the international community has acknowledged that the threat of terrorism is grave and universal, and can only be defeated by collective efforts of all UN member states, without any exception. It is only after 9/11 that we accepted that terrorism in one part of the world can directly impact another part of the world and we all came together to fight terrorism collectively, he said. The envoy said the international community should not forget that before the 9/11 terror attacks, the world was divided into your terrorists or my terrorists . Two decades later, we are now seeing attempts to divide us once again by adopting new terminologies under the guise of emerging threats such as racially and ethnically-motivated violent extremism, violent nationalism, right wing extremism, he said. "I do hope that member states do not forget history and divide terrorism again into different categories and take us back to the era of 'your terrorists' and 'my terrorists' and erase the gains we have had over the last two decades, Tirumurti said. He noted that the continued absence of a universally agreed definition of terrorism is detrimental to our shared goal of eliminating the global scourge. The current strategy fails to resolve the stalemate preventing the adoption of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism, which India has championed, Tirumurti said. According to the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism, the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is a unique global instrument to enhance national, regional and international efforts to counter terrorism. Through its adoption by consensus in 2006, all UN Member States agreed the first time to a common strategic and operational approach to fighting terrorism . The UN General Assembly reviews the Strategy every two years, making it a living document attuned to member states' counter-terrorism priorities. The General Assembly reviews the Strategy and considers the adoption of a resolution on this occasion, the UN agency said. Tirumurti said the Global Counter Terrorism Strategy was adopted by consensus 15 years ago and was a major step forward in maintaining and achieving international peace and security. It was agreed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations should be condemned, there cannot be any exception or justification for any act of terrorism, regardless of motivations behind such acts, and wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed. It was also recognised that the menace of terrorism cannot be and should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilisation or ethnic group, Tirumurti said. He said it is essential for all member states to not only not squander the gains of what we have achieved so far but also ensure that we do not give the slightest opportunity to provide excuses or justification for terrorism, thereby diminishing our collective fight". "Justifying terrorism in any way, whether on grounds of religion, ideology, ethnicity or race, will only provide the necessary fodder for terrorists to enhance their activities even more, he said. Noting that while the matter of religious phobias finds mention in the current document, Tirumurti said India is once again constrained to point out that this listing has been selective and confined only to the three Abrahamic religions. This august body has once again failed to acknowledge the rise of hatred and violent terrorist attacks against other religions, inter alia, Buddhism, Sikhism and Hinduism. Further, we need to make a distinction between countries which are pluralistic and those which resort to sectarian violence and trample over minority rights. United Nations is not a body or the forum where member states should take sides on religious-phobias, but should instead truly foster a culture based on universal principles of humanity and compassion so that terrorists' narratives are fought collectively, he said. The envoy also asserted that success of this strategy will depend only if member states walk the talk by sincerely implementing the provisions and fulfilling their obligations as envisaged in the strategy. As a victim of cross-border terrorism for several decades, India has been at the forefront of the fight against terrorism and one of the major victims of terrorism. However, it's time to call out those that blatantly violate global commitments by harbouring terrorists and terrorist entities by willfully giving moral, material, financial and ideological support to these groups, he said. Tirumurti said the misuse of internet and social media for terrorist propaganda, radicalisation and recruitment of cadre; misuse of new payment methods such as block-chain currencies, payment wallets, crowdfunding platforms for terrorism financing; and misuse of emerging technologies such as drones, 3D printing, Artificial Intelligence, robotics have emerged as the most serious threats of terrorism, which warrants collaborative actions from all member states. The international community needs to adopt a policy of zero-tolerance towards terrorism. Our collective condemnation of terrorism must be loud, clear and without any ambiguity, he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-462
07-07-2021||India||IT Rules: Delhi HC refuses to grant interim protection to digital media portals||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday refused to grant protection from coercive action to digital media portals as it adjourned their challenge to the new IT Rules after being informed that a plea has been moved by the Centre to transfer them to the Supreme Court. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh asked Additional Solicitor General Vikramjit Banerjee if the Transfer petition has been preferred, to which the latter replied, Yes. The court then proceeded to adjourn the pleas by The Wire, Quint Digital Media Ltd and Pravda Media Foundation till August 20. According to amended Information Technology Rules, social media and streaming companies will be required to take down contentious content quicker, appoint grievance redressal officers and assist in investigations. Senior Advocate Nitya Ramakrishnan, appearing for the portals, urged the court to pass an order of interim protection as the Central government was yet to even reply to the petitions filed by digital media portals. Notice has gone on the rules and they have not filed reply. Now they are asking me to report to them. This is the first step in submitting to the discipline (of regulation of content by government). Please hear my stay application and grant me protection, she said. She added that the central government's conduct was totally in the face of Supreme Court decision that government regulation of content of media is unacceptable. In response, Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma said that 1700 digital media has already submitted information as per the IT Rules. It is not a matter voice-vote, Ramakrishnan stated as she asserted that the digital media portals before the court had preferred to challenge the new IT Rules. The Court, however, refused to pass any order and directed the Centre to file counter affidavit. The high court had earlier issued notices and sought responses of the Centre on the petitions by Foundation for Independent Journalism, The Wire, Quint Digital Media Ltd and Pravda Media Foundation which is the parent company of Alt News. The bench had refused however to pass any interim order and said it will be considered at a later stage. The petition by Quint Digital Media Ltd and its director and co-founder Ritu Kapur has challenged the constitutional validity of the IT Rules under the provisions of Information Technology Act, 2000, inasmuch as they purport to apply to 'publishers of news and current affairs content' as part of digital media, and consequently regulate these entities under the Rules by imposing government oversight and a Code of Ethics' which stipulates such vague conditions as good taste', decency' and prohibition of half-truths'. Creating a differential classification by way of subordinate legislation, when not contemplated by the parent IT Act is an overreach by itself and this has been done to specifically target digital news portals, by subjecting them to an unprecedented regulatory burden and State interference, which no other form of news publication is subject to, it said. It claimed that this overreach is aggravated by a virtual legislation by reference, inasmuch as the Rules incorporate the Journalistic Norms under the Press Council Act, the Programme Code under the Cable TV Act, and vest draconian powers and control in the State. The pleas sought striking down of the specific part of the IT Rules on the ground that it violates Article 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution creating a chilling effect on media freedom, Article 14 of the Constitution by creating an unreasonable classification and by setting up a parallel adjudicatory mechanism to be overseen by the officials of the executive and is ultra vires the IT Act. The 2021 Rules regulate the functioning of online media portals and publishers, over-the-top (OTT) platforms and social media intermediaries.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-462

After Tuesday’s developments, none of the 24 districts have an active caseload in triple digits, while at least four districts – Ramgarh, Pakur, Godda and Garhwa – have less than 10 Covid patients, data compiled by the National Health Mission (NHM) revealed. As per a bulletin released by the NHM, Ranchi reported five Covid cases against 25 recoveries on Tuesday, which brought the active caseload in the district to 80. East Singhbhum reported a spike of 17 cases and the active caseload there rose to 59 as only 12 patients recovered from Coronavirus infection there. At least 55 people were found infected by the lethal virus in Jharkhand on the day, while 108 Covid patients recovered. At least 12 districts – West Singhbhum, Simdega, Saraikela, Pakur, Lohardaga, Khunti, Hazaribag, Godda, Giridih, Garhwa, Dumka and Chatra – did not report fresh cases of Covid-19 on the day. The state on Tuesday tested swab samples of 65,991 residents and only 0.8 per cent of them were found infected by Coronavirus. As per government data, over 3.46 lakh people have been infected by the virus in Jharkhand so far and 98.36 per cent of them have recovered. On Tuesday, another Covid patient, a resident of East Singhbhum, died during treatment, taking the toll in the district to 1039 and that in Jharkhand to 5118. The state has so far reported a Covid mortality rate of 1.47 per cent. The doubling rate of Covid-19 reached close to 4000 days in Jharkhand on Tuesday, while the growth rate remained 0.02 per cent against the national average of 0.10 per cent. As per government data, it would take at least 3920.44 days for the number of Covid cases to double in the state at the current growth rate. The national doubling rate was 710.58 days. Jharkhand administered vaccines against Covid-19 to over 1 lakh beneficiaries for the third day in a row on Tuesday. As per government data, the first dose was administered to 988,878 residents, while 41,330 beneficiaries received the second jab. More than 80,000 of the beneficiaries were younger than 45 years.

07-07-2021||India||NewsClick chief editor gets interim protection from arrest||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday granted interim protection from arrest to news portal NewsClick's editor-in-chief and founder in connection with a Delhi Police FIR concerning foreign funding. Justice Yogesh Khanna issued notice on the plea by Prabir Purkayastha seeking anticipatory bail and sought status report from Delhi Police. The court sought reply and granted interim protection from arrest to NewsClick director Pranjal Pandey as well on his anticipatory bail plea in the FIR. The judge said he would pass a detailed order on the pleas later in the day. The allegations in the FIR, registered by the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police, are that the company, PPK NewsClick Studio Pvt Ltd, received Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of Rs 9.59 crore from Worldwide Media Holdings LLC USA during the financial year 2018-19, in violation of the law. Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Purkayastha, contended that funding from the US-based company was received by NewsClick in the year when there was no cap on FDI. He is a famous journalist and runs a digital media platform. Digital media platforms were allowed to get money from outside... The cap came the following year, Sibal argued. He further argued that there was no question of siphoning off of funds as the same had been utilised for paying salaries to employees and that there was no loss to the exchequer in the process. The high court has already granted Purkayastha protection from coercive action in the money laundering case being probed by the Enforcement Directorate, he said. Sibal informed the court that the investigating agency issued summon to Purkayastha on June 30 to appear before it on Thursday, July 8. Manjziit S Oberoi, appearing for the State, objected to the anticipatory bail plea, stating that Purkayastha "has directly come to the high court". The FIR alleges that the investment was made by greatly overvaluing the shares of the company to avoid the alleged cap of 26 per cent of FDI in a digital news website. It was further alleged that over 45 per cent of this investment was diverted/siphoned off for the payment of salary/consultancy, rent and other expenses, which payments are alleged to have been made for ulterior motives. Therefore, the company has violated the FDI and other laws of the country and has caused a loss to the government exchequer, it alleged. The company, through another petition, has already sought quashing of the Delhi Police FIR on the allegations of foreign funding on the ground that it does not disclose any cognisable offences as alleged. The petition seeking quashing of the FIR is already listed for hearing on July 29. The high court had on June 21 directed the ED not to take coercive action against the news portal and its editor-in-chief in connection with the money laundering case. It had issued notice to the ED on the portal's plea seeking a copy of the ECIR lodged by it in the case.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-462
07-07-2021||India||Elgar case accused observe hunger strike in Mumbai jail against 'institutional murder' of Stan Swamy||Ten accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case went on a one-day hunger strike in the Taloja jail in neighbouring Navi Mumbai on Wednesday to protest against what they termed as an "institutional murder" of co-accused Jesuit priest Stan Swamy. They also demanded action against officials of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is conducting a probe into the Elgar Parishad case, and former superintendent of the Taloja jail. Swamy, 84, was arrested by the NIA from Ranchi in October 2020 under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and lodged at the Taloja Central Jail in Navi Mumbai. He suffered a cardiac arrest and died at a Mumbai hospital on Monday in the middle of his fight for bail on health grounds. The Elgar Parishad case is related to inflammatory speeches made at a conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which, the police claimed, triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the outskirts of the western Maharashtra city. The police had claimed the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links. The other accused in the case termed Swamy's death an "institutional murder" and held the "negligent jails, indifferent courts and malicious investigating agencies" responsible for it. As a mark of protest, 10 of the co-accused in the case - Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Sudhir Dhawale, Mahesh Raut, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Gautam Navlakha, Anand Teltumbde, Ramesh Gaichor and Sagar Gorkhe - went on a one-day fast in the Taloja jail on Wednesday. They informed about the protest to their family members, who released a statement saying all Elgar case prisoners have blamed the NIA and the Taloja jail's former superintendent Kaustubh Kurlekar for the death of Father Stan Swamy. They believe that "the separation of Stan Swamy from them is a deliberate institutional murder," the release said. The statement alleged that the NIA and Kurlekar never missed a single opportunity to "harass" Stan Swamy, whether it was the "ghastly treatment" inside the jail, the haste to transfer him back from hospital to jail or even protesting against trivial things like a sipper (which Swamy required due to his medical conditions). "It is these that have caused the death of Stan Swamy and therefore, for this institutional murder, NIA officials and Kurlekar should be tried under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code," the statement said, while demanding a judicial inquiry into his death. The statement said the family members of the accused will submit these demands to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray through the Taloja jail administration. It also said that though these accused were lodged in different barracks, they met on Tuesday and shared their memories of Father Stan Swamy, and also observed a two-minute silence as a mark of tribute to him. Three women accused in the case- Sudha Bharadwaj, Shoma Sen and Jyoti Jagtap - are currently lodged at the Byculla prison in Mumbai.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-462
07-07-2021||India|| Ahead of Cabinet reshuffle, ministerial probables meet Narendra Modi||Ahead of the Union Cabinet expansion on Wednesday evening, ministerial probables met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his residence. Those meeting Modi included BJP's Narayan Rane, Sarbananda Sonowal, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Ajay Bhatt, Bhupender Yadav, Shobha Karandlaje, Sunita Duggal, Meenakshi Lekhi, Bharati Pawar, Shantanu Thakur and Kapil Patil, JD(U)'s R C P Singh, LJP's Pashupati Paras and Apna Dal's Anupriya Patel. Some ministers of state, including G Kishan Reddy, Parshottam Rupala and Anurag Thakur, were also there, and they may be elevated, sources said. BJP president J P Nadda is also there. The expansion exercise is scheduled to be held at 6 pm at Rashtrapati Bhawan. Amid the buzz that Modi may also drop some ministers, Union minister Santosh Gangwar has quit. This will be the first reshuffle in his Council of Ministers by Modi since he assumed charge for a second term in May 2019. The prime minister is expected to bring in young faces and give representation to various social groups and regions in the reshuffle. The exercise comes against the backdrop of a massive review, which has stretched for weeks, undertaken by the BJP top brass of the works of Union ministers and the organisation against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic. A BJP leader said the reshuffle is expected to be a "big shake-up" with Modi addressing political challenges, including the assembly polls in five states early next year, and governance issues. The prime minister is also scheduled to chair a Cabinet meeting, hours before the expected reshuffle. His review of the works of his ministers, early next year assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Manipur and Punjab and the COVID-19 pandemic that has been a factor in the internal evaluation of the party's governance and organisational works are likely to weigh heavy in the expected reshuffle. Representation of BJP MPs from Bengal and the Northeast may go up. Another BJP ally All India Jharkhand Students Union may also get a berth, sources said as the BJP looks to boost its partners' representation in the ministry after its old allies like Shiv Sena and Shiromani Akali Dal severed their ties with it. Ramadas Athavale, a junior minister, is the only BJP ally in the government as of now. The current strength of the Council of Ministers is 53, including Modi, and its maximum number can be 81. Against the massive review exercise within the central government and the party machinery, the prime minister may go for new faces with an eye on grooming younger leaders while also factoring in caste and regional balances. There is also a buzz about Modi inducting some professionals and those with domain expertise besides bringing in more women. The reshuffles undertaken by Modi so far, all in his first term, have also seen some ministers being dropped or removed from key portfolios on account of their performance. The prime minister has also sprung surprises in the past by inducting those with apolitical background, like S Jaishankar and Hardeep Singh Puri, as ministers.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-462

They said Chaudhary was arrested on Tuesday night after he was questioned at length in the case at the office of the central investigative agency in south Mumbai. The officials alleged that Chaudhary was not cooperative during the questioning. He is expected to be produced before a special court that tries cases registered under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Khadse, 68, had left the BJP to join the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) of former Maharashtra chief minister Sharad Pawar last year. He was questioned in the case by the ED early this year. Khadse, 68, had resigned from the then Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra cabinet in 2016 after facing allegations regarding the same land deal. It was alleged that he misused his official powers to facilitate the purchase of government land of the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) by his family in the Bhosari area of Pune. He denied any wrongdoing, saying that the Maharashtra Anti-Corruption Bureau as well as the Income Tax department had given him a clean chit in the matter.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-462

The case was filed against the immigration minister of the Caribbean nation, its police chief and the investigating officer of the case. Choksi, who went missing from Antigua and Barbuda where he had been living since 2018 after his escape from India, was arrested on May 23 in neighbouring Dominica for illegal entry. He was declared a prohibited immigrant by the Ministry of Immigration in Dominica. The 62-year-old diamantaire wanted in connection with a Rs 13,500-crore scam in the Punjab National Bank has approached the high court in Dominica, alleging that the decision of Lincoln Corbette, Acting Chief of Police in Roseau, and investigating officer Sergeant Alleyne to charge him for illegal entry was "not a product of their independent judgement". "...they allowed themselves to be dictated by third parties, representatives of the Indian government...," Choksi alleged. Seeking to quash the proceedings against him, Choksi pleaded before the high court that the decision to charge him for illegal entry was violative of law and accordingly, null and void, Caribbean media outlet Nature Isle News reported. Choksi said he is a citizen of Antigua and Barbuda, where he has challenged a move to extradite him. He claimed that he was kidnapped from Antigua and Barbuda and forcibly brought to Dominica by Indian men. Choksi claimed that he had narrated his ordeal to the Dominican police but they did not launch any investigation into his allegations. "The arrest and prosecution of the applicant is an abuse of the process of the court because the police who charged the applicant participated in and/or colluded with the applicant's kidnappers in and/or condoned the forced entry of the applicant into Dominica," he said. His lawyers on Tuesday told the magistrate court where his case of illegal entry is going on that they have filed the plea in the high court. Choksi has sought a permanent order staying the criminal charge" brought against him for illegal entry. He has also sought a court order stating that the minister of immigration and national security declaring him an illegal immigrant was a breach of the principles of natural justice, and is accordingly null and void, and of no effect, the website reported.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-463
07-07-2021||India||Stanislaus Lourduswamy hailed as a martyr by fellow Jesuits||Clothed in the red vestment that symbolises martyrdom for Catholics, Stanislaus Lourduswamy was hailed as a martyr by fellow Jesuits at his funeral service in Mumbai on Tuesday. Father Stan Swamy died in judicial custody on Monday, held captive in a case in which the priest was an accused in an alleged Maoist plot that has evoked incredulity among civil society. Although a Jesuit who celebrated the funeral Mass clarified that they would not be seeking for Fr Stan to be formally recognised as a martyr by the Catholic Church, the symbolism of a Mass being offered for a “martyr” created in a democratic country is significant. During the service that was livecast online, Jerome Cutinha, provincial of the Jamshedpur Jesuit Province, delivered an obituary for Fr Stan who was based in Ranchi until his arrest last October in the Elgaar Parishad case. “May the martyrdom of Stan inspire and challenge us and the entire nation to recommit ourselves to take forward the legacy of Father Stan in the mission of justice and reconciliation. We offer to God the friends of Stan, the hundreds of Adivasi undertrials who languish in jails on false charges. We offer the co-accused of Stan, accused of fabricated charges and now incarcerated,” Cutinha said. Frazer Mascarenhas, former principal of Mumbai’s St. Xavier’s College and parish priest of the St Peter’s Church in Bandra where the Mass was offered, told The Telegraph later: “He paid the price for doing his justice work. In that sense he is a martyr…. We don’t mean it in the religious context.” The All India Catholic Union, the country’s main association of Catholics who are not priests or nuns, echoed the martyrdom reference, reflecting the widespread perception that the death was a result of harassment by investigators. The Flagellation of Christ according to the Gospel of John was read out by Joseph Xavier, director of Bangalore’s Indian Social Institute. The episode in the Bible describes how Pontius Pilate is unable to find fault with Jesus when he is handed over to be crucified. Among the verses read were: “Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews gathered there, ‘Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.’ “…As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him (Jesus wearing the crown of thorns), they shouted, ‘Crucify! Crucify!’ “But Pilate answered: ‘You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.’” Fr Stan, a tribal rights defender, was among 16 people arrested in the Elgaar Parishad case — an investigation into alleged Maoist links to an Ambedkarite event on the eve of 2018 which was followed by caste clashes the next day that claimed one life. The case expanded to a purge of “urban Naxals”— a term coined by a Right-wing commentator to brand academics, lawyers and rights defenders like Fr Stan who are accused of clandestinely working for the banned CPI (Maoist). The case was transferred from Maharashtra police to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) soon after the BJP lost power in the state. In religious terms, the last time a death was termed as martyrdom by the Church in India was in 2011 when catholic nun Valsa John Malamel was hacked to death in Jharkhand. She was involved in a predominantly Santhal tribal movement against coal mining in the Sahibganj district and was reportedly targeted for taking up the cause of a rape victim. However, the formal process to declare her a martyr by the Catholic Church has not begun. In 2017, Pope Francis bestowed the “decree of martyrdom” — a path to sainthood where the process is shorter than other categories — on another nun, Rani Maria, who was killed for organising landless labourers near Indore in 1995. In May this year, nun María Agustina Rivas López, who was killed by Maoist rebels in Peru in 1990, received the decree. Stanislaus D’Souza, president of the Jesuit Conference of South Asia, said via videoconference during the Mass: “He (Fr Stan) was hounded because of his staunch support to the struggle of the Adivasis and the Dalits for their basic human rights…. His death was hastened because of the rough treatment that was meted out to him in custody.” Delivering the eulogy, Mascarenhas, the parish priest, said: “I like to remember him with the word he used for himself and for his friends. The word: ‘comrade’. He said ‘my comrades are important to me’. “Now don’t think for a while that comrade means Maoist, violent type. Nothing to do with Stan. That is absolutely a ridiculous accusation. Stan was gentle and one who loved peace. So, there is no question of violence about him. But he considered all those working for humanity, especially the deprived sections of humanity, as his comrades.” Mascarenhas added: “That’s the reason why he was effective and became a thorn in the side of the powerful… because he became successful in the constitutional method of getting rights for people.” The All India Catholic Union said in a statement: “The course of the various stages of his bail application, the manner in which the investigating agencies and the prosecution insisted he was too dangerous to be released are ample evidence that the State wanted to make an example out of him, and the others arrested with him.… “In life and in his martyrdom, Fr Stan Swamy has become a beacon for all who struggle for human rights, specially the rights of the tribals and other marginalised people, and a role model for young men and women across the nation.” It added: “The All India Catholic Union reaffirms this demand for a judicial enquiry, and also demands the repeal of the UAPA and such draconian laws under which thousands of people, old and young, have been put in jail and denied rudimentary justice.” Fr Stan’s lawyer Mihir Desai told this newspaper that no decision had been taken yet on how to pursue the demand for a judicial probe. Fr Stan was cremated by the Jesuits in Mumbai after the Mass. His ashes will be taken to Ranchi where a memorial monument is planned. Transporting the body itself, said a Jesuit source, could face logistics hurdles. In Delhi, several SFI activists, including Aishe Ghosh and Dipsita Dhar, were detained in a police station for protesting against what they called the “State-sponsored murder” of Fr Stan. The protesting farmers in Ghazipur, too, paid homage to Fr Stan.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-463
07-07-2021||India||Modi in RSF's 'Predators of Press Freedom' list||International media watchdog Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF) has placed Prime Minister Narendra Modi in its list of “Predators of Press Freedom”, a “gallery of grim portraits” that includes North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, Pakistan’s Imran Khan and China’s Xi Jinping. The list of 37 heads of state or government who have been accused of cracking down on media freedom also has Iran’s Ali Khamenei, Syria’s Bashar Al-Assad, Myanmar army general Min Aung Hlaing, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro. In the explanatory note of the list that the RSF has brought out after a gap of five years, the organisation has said that some of these “predators of press freedom” have been operating for more than two decades while others have just joined the “blacklist”. The RSF is a France-headquartered international non-profit and non-government organisation that aims to safeguard the right to freedom of information. Women have made it to the list for the first time — Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Hong Kong’s Carrie Lam — as has a European leader, Hungary’s Viktor Orban. “All are heads of state or government who trample on press freedom by creating a censorship apparatus, jailing journalists arbitrarily or inciting violence against them, when they don’t have blood on their hands because they have directly or indirectly pushed for journalists to be murdered,” the RSF said. Modi has been classified as a “predator since taking office”, and the explanatory note has pointed out that India is ranked 142nd among 180 countries in the 2021 World Press Freedom Index. There was no response from the Union government till Tuesday evening after The Telegraph sought comment on the inclusion of Modi in the RSF list. The RSF has identified the Indian Prime Minister’s “predatory” method to be “national populism and disinformation”, flagging the pejoratives used by the Right-wing ecosystem for their critics — “sickulars and presstitues”. About Modi, the RSF said: “His leading weapon is to flood the mainstream media with speeches and information tending to legitimise his national-populist ideology. To this end, he has developed close ties with billionaire businessmen who own vast media empires. This insidious strategy works in two ways. “On the one hand, by visibly ingratiating himself with the owners of leading media outlets, their journalists know they risk dismissal if they criticise the government. On the other, prominent coverage of his extremely divisive and derogatory speeches, which often constitute disinformation, enables the media to achieve record audience levels. All that is left for Modi is to neutralise the media outlets and journalists that question his divisive methods.” For this, the RSF noted, Modi has a “judicial arsenal with provisions that pose a major threat to press freedom”. The note cited the use of the sedition law as a case in point. “He has a judicial arsenal with provisions that pose a major threat to press freedom. For example, journalists risk the possibility of life imprisonment under the extremely vague charge of sedition. To round off this arsenal, Modi can count on an army of online trolls known as ‘yodha’ (the Hindi word for ‘warriors’), who wage appalling hate campaigns on social media against the journalists they don’t like, campaigns that almost routinely include calls for the journalists to be killed,” the RSF said. The RSF referred to the 2017 murder of veteran journalist Gauri Lankesh, calling her “the best-known victim of Hindutva, the ideology that spawned the Hindu nationalist movement that worships Modi”. The RSF also said that the attacks on the media “are even more virulent if the targets are women journalists, who are labelled as “presstitutes”. “Rana Ayyub and Barkha Dutt, for example, were subjected to calls for them to be gang-raped and their personal data was posted online to facilitate attacks,” the report said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-463
07-07-2021||India||Mathura court rejects Siddique Kappan’s bail plea||A Mathura court on Tuesday rejected the bail plea of journalist Siddique Kappan, in jail for eight months for alleged sedition and terror funding, saying that the charges against him were serious. One of the charges is that “Rs 20,000 and Rs 25,000 had been deposited in the bank account of the accused on different dates for illegal activities”. Anil Kumar Pandey, the additional sessions judge, said on the second day of the hearing that Kappan was free to move Allahabad High Court. Kappan was arrested on October 5 along with three suspected members of the Popular Front of India (PFI) while he was on his way to Hathras in Uttar Pradesh to report on the gang rape and murder of a Dalit teen for a Malayalam news portal to which he contributes. Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi, counsel for Kappan, told The Telegraph: “The bail plea was rejected without taking into consideration the arguments in support of Kappan. There is no proof that he is a member of the Popular Front of India. In any case, the PFI is not a banned organisation.” “The entire case was built around his identity as a PFI member,” Chaturvedi said. The PFI describes itself as a “neo-social movement” for empowering marginalised sections but opponents view it as an Islamist organisation with a hardline agenda. “The court rejected the bail application while observing that the charges were serious,” Chaturvedi said. The court order said: “The accused had said he was a journalist and was going to Hathras for journalistic work. But an identity card mentioning Tejas News was recovered from him at the time of his arrest. It has been stated that Tejas News was closed in December 2018.” “It was found during the investigation that the accused had been working for the PFI and working on the direction of the PFI to instigate communal/class conflict. It was found that he was involved in anti-national activities…. Write-ups recovered from the laptop of the accused… were found to be provoking communal hatred. The accused was found involved in illegal activities on the pretext of journalism. “It was also found that the accused belongs to the PFI and is a member of a terrorist group that receives funds from within the country and abroad and is involved in disturbing the country’s integrity and communal harmony,” the court added. “Some literature of the banned organisation Simi was found from his residence in Delhi during a raid. He was found in touch with the top leaders of Simi. It was found that Rs 20,000 and Rs 25,000 had been deposited in the bank account of the accused on different dates for illegal activities…. The co-accused have already been denied bail in the case by the sessions court. “So going by the facts, situations and seriousness of the case, I don’t find a valid reason to release the accused on bail,” the court said. Last month, the court of the divisional district magistrate of Mathura had discharged Kappan and three others in a case relating to breach of peace. Uttar Pradesh police had lodged a case in the court of the sub-divisional magistrate on October 5 under Section 116(6) of the CrPC, accusing Kappan and the three others of travelling to Hathras with the motive of breaching peace. On October 7, a second case was lodged against them under UAPA Sections 17 (raising funds for terrorist act) and 18 (conspiracy) and Indian Penal Code Sections 124A (sedition), 153A (promoting enmity between groups), 295A (malicious acts to outrage religious feelings) and 120B (criminal conspiracy). Sections 65 and 72 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, dealing with tampering of computer sources and breach of confidentiality and privacy were also slapped against them. This case is being heard by the additional sessions court that denied bail to Kappan on Tuesday.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-463
07-07-2021||India||Covid: Govt flags concerns over 'violation' of precautions||The Union health ministry on Tuesday flagged concerns about what it said were “violations” of Covid-19 precautions by the public in markets and tourist sites amid an ebbing second wave but large outbreaks evident in 73 districts in 17 states. Any laxity in precautions such as wearing masks or avoiding crowds could nullify the gains made so far through efforts at curbing the epidemic, said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the Union health ministry. “People are walking in bazars and hill stations without physical distancing, without masks,” Agarwal told reporters, displaying images of crowds at markets in Delhi and Mumbai and at tourist sites in Manali, Shimla and Mussoorie. “If restrictions have been eased, it doesn’t mean the virus has gone away. The virus is very much here. Laxity could allow the virus to spread again,” he said. “We’ve been saying right from the start that we need community participation in our response.” India recorded 34,026 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday after a near-steady decline in daily new infections over the past eight weeks from a peak of 414,188 new cases on May 7. The number of active patients has also declined to 450,000 from over 3.6 million in mid-May. Only 91 districts have recorded more than 100 new daily cases over the past week, compared with 531 such districts in early May, although the number of daily tests done has been about 1.8 million since early May. But 18 districts in Arunachal Pradesh, 10 in Rajasthan, nine in Manipur, seven in Kerala and six in Meghalaya are among the 73 districts in 17 states where the test positivity rate — the fraction found positive among those tested — is 10 per cent or higher, an indicator of large outbreaks. The test positivity rate should ideally be below 5 per cent and as low as possible. A high rate implies that testing needs to be increased so that cases are detected early enough and isolated to prevent further spread. “District-specific measures should continue to be guided by test positivity rates there,” said Balram Bhargava, director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research. “If the rate is below 5 per cent, we can ease restrictions. If the rate goes beyond 10 per cent, we need to instate certain restrictive measures that have been shown to be effective. And we have to continue to maintain high testing levels.” Over half of the 73 districts are in the northeastern states where, in some districts, the test positivity rates are extremely high — 98 per cent in Anjaw, 78 per cent in Tirap and 70 per cent in Upper Siang, all in Arunachal Pradesh, and 40 per cent at Ri Bhoi in Meghalaya. Health experts say such high levels point to the need for rapid increase in testing. The ICMR’s National Institute of Epidemiology had earlier this year recommended the step-wise introduction of restrictions at the district level depending on three key criteria — the test positivity rate, trends in daily new cases and the occupancy rates of oxygen-supported and intensive care unit beds.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-463
07-07-2021||India||Nitish expresses surprise over the amount of rainfall and floods||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday expressed surprise over the amount of rainfall and deluge in June and July in the state after undertaking an aerial survey of the flood-affected areas. “I saw several places have been submerged. This is just the beginning of July. So much flood had never come so early in the state. It used to affect in late July, August or September. Such a situation is rare,” Nitish told reporters after the aerial survey. The chief minister took a chopper ride over East Champaran, West Champaran, Sheohar, Sitamarhi and Muzaffarpur districts to get a first-hand account of the deluge that has affected a large population and forced thousands to abandon their homes in search of safer places. “Floodwater has reached several places, but not all areas. I also saw the state of several rivers. I am going to conduct a meeting with the district magistrates of areas affected by the floods and discuss the situation. I will survey the situation in Samastipur, Madhubani and Darbhanga on Wednesday. My present concern is to provide help to the people,” Nitish added. This is the second spell of floods in Bihar this year. The first one struck in mid-June just as the monsoon descended in these parts bringing very heavy rain in Bihar and Nepal. The neighbouring country has the catchment areas of a majority of rivers flowing through Bihar. Weather scientists also corroborated Nitish’s observations pointing out that the rainfall was way above the normal at this time of the year. “Bihar received 111 per cent above normal rainfall in June this year. This is unprecedented compared to recent years. If we take into consideration July also, the cumulative rainfall is 92 per cent above normal,” India Meteorological Department (IMD) Patna centre director Vivek Sinha told The Telegraph. “The above normal rainfall could be attributed to heavy pre-monsoon rain in the first week of June due to a depression, early onset of monsoon and the monsoon trough being positioned over Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh,” he added. At least 16 districts — East Champaran, West Champaran, Gopalganj, Saran, Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Samastipur, Khagaria, Araria, Purnea, Katihar, Kishanganj, Supaul — have been hit by flood so far. Civic amenities, including roads and hospitals, have been submerged or damaged at several places in these districts. People have had to also grapple with the disruption of power supply. Though the discharge of water from the Valmikinagar and Birpur barrages into the Gandak and Kosi rivers, respectively, decreased on Tuesday, several of the flood-causing rivers are flowing above the danger level. These rivers include the Bagmati, Budhi Gandak, Kamla Balan, Adhwara and Khiroi.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-463
07-07-2021||India||Stan Swamy: Centre cites 'due process' of law for detention ||The external affairs ministry on Tuesday said the arrest and detention of Father Stan Swamy had been made by following the “due process” of law and that India remained committed to the protection of the human rights of all its citizens. The comments, the government’s first reaction to the death of the 84-year-old ailing human rights activist and Jesuit priest in a Mumbai hospital on Monday while waiting for bail after eight months of incarceration, came in the aftermath of growing criticism from global organisations. The apex UN human rights agency said on Tuesday that it was “deeply saddened and disturbed” by the death of Fr Stan during his pre-trial detention and urged India and other countries to release individuals detained “without a sufficient legal basis”, including dissenters. Without referring to any particular statement that has come from overseas on Fr Stan, external affairs ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi said: “Father Stan Swamy was arrested and detained by the National Investigation Agency following due process under law. Because of the specific nature of the charges against him, his bail applications were rejected by the courts. Authorities in India act against violations of law and not against legitimate exercise of rights. All such actions are strictly in accordance with the law.” Adding that Fr Stan had been receiving treatment at a private hospital since May 28 according to Bombay High Court’s instructions, the official statement said: “India’s democratic and constitutional polity is complemented by an independent judiciary, a range of national and state-level human rights commissions that monitor violations, a free media and a vibrant and vocal civil society. India remains committed to promotion and protection of human rights of all its citizens.” The ministry issued the statement after the United Nations Human Rights office had tweeted: “#India: We are saddened & disturbed by the death of 84-year-old human rights defender Father #StanSwamy, after prolonged pre-trial detention. With Covid-19, it is even more urgent that States release every person detained without sufficient legal basis.” During a media briefing in Geneva, Liz Throssel, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, provided an insight into how the world views the case. “Fr Stan had been held in pre-trial detention without bail since his arrest, charged with terrorism-related offences in relation to demonstrations that date back to 2018. He was a long-standing activist, particularly on the rights of indigenous peoples and other marginalised groups,” she said. “While in Mumbai’s Taloja Central Jail, his health deteriorated and he reportedly contracted Covid-19. His repeated applications for bail were rejected. He died as Bombay High Court was considering an appeal against the rejection of his bail application,” Throssell added. She also said in a statement: “We are deeply saddened and disturbed by the death of 84-year-old Father Stan Swamy, a human rights defender and Jesuit priest, in Mumbai yesterday, following his arrest in October 2020 under India’s Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.” “In light of the continued, severe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is even more urgent that States, including India, release every person detained without a sufficient legal basis, including those detained simply for expressing critical or dissenting views. This would be in line with the Indian judiciary’s calls to decongest the prisons,” the statement added. “We stress, once again, the High Commissioner’s (for Human Rights) call on the Government of India to ensure that no one is detained for exercising their fundamental rights to freedom of expression, of peaceful assembly and of association,” it said. Throssell’s remarks and similar statements on Monday from the European Union’s Special Representative for Human Rights and the Chair of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom make it clear that India’s frequent iterations of commitment to democracy and human rights are being measured against actions on the ground. “UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet and the UN’s independent experts have repeatedly raised the cases of Father Stan and 15 other human rights defenders associated with the same events with the Government of India over the past three years and urged their release from pre-trial detention,” Throssell said. Fr Stan was among 16 people arrested in the Elgaar Parishad case, an investigation into alleged Maoist links to an Ambedkarite event on December 31, 2017, that was followed by caste clashes the next day that claimed one life.“The High Commissioner has also raised concerns over the use of the UAPA in relation to human rights defenders,” Throssell said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-463
07-07-2021||India||Modi greets Dalai Lama on his birthday||Prime Minister Narendra Modi let the world know on Tuesday that he had personally wished Tibet’s spiritual leader the Dalai Lama a happy 86th birthday in a phone call, in what is being seen as a signal to China. “Spoke on phone to His Holiness the @DalaiLama to convey greetings on his 86th birthday. We wish him a long and healthy life,” Modi said on Twitter. Beijing regards the Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile in India for more than six decades, as a separatist, and frowns on any engagement with him. This is the first time Modi has acknowledged contact with the Dalai Lama since taking office in 2014. Neither has he publicly acknowledged the Dalai Lama’s wishes to him since 2015. There was no immediate response from the Chinese foreign office or the embassy in New Delhi to the Prime Minister’s tweet. Modi’s tweet, which was followed by several chief ministers greeting the Dalai Lama, was indicative of a stalemate in the bilateral efforts to de-escalate and disengage at all the friction points along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. “This is the first public greetings. Till last year even party officials were not allowed to publicly greet him,” said Srikanth Kondapalli, a professor of Chinese studies at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University. In June last year, Chinese troops attacked an Indian border patrol, killing 20. China later said it lost four soldiers during that clash. Relations have been tense since. Modi’s decision to announce his conversation with the Dalai Lama is seen as a bid to play the Tibetan card just like India’s announcement of the use of the covert Special Frontier Force along the LAC last year. The government not only acknowledged the use of SFF — a force raised in 1962 with Tibetan refugees for covert operations behind Chinese lines — for patrolling the LAC, but also allowed a lot of publicity for the funeral of a SFF company leader killed in an accidental mine blast while on duty. Just three years ago, when Modi was pursuing a detente with Chinese President Xi Jinping, his government had asked Tibetans in India not to hold a rally to mark the 60th anniversary of the uprising. Chinese troops seized Tibet in 1950 in what Beijing calls a “peaceful liberation”, and the Dalai Lama fled into exile in 1959, following a failed uprising against Chinese rule.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-463

With the board exams being cancelled because of the second wave of Covid-19, schools have been tasked with tabulation of results using separate alternative assessment policy announced by the CBSE for the two classes. “To ensure that policy issued by the CBSE is implemented effectively, it has been decided that schools be immediately visited by the officials of the regional offices to verify the work done by the schools under their jurisdiction,” CBSE examination controller Sanyam Bhardwaj said in a letter to regional offices.

07-07-2021||India||J&K: Enforcement Directorate summons Mehbooba Mufti’s mother||The Delimitation Commission’s first trip to Jammu and Kashmir after Narendra Modi’s all-party meeting with Valley leaders began on a controversial note after the Enforcement Directorate summoned PDP president Mehbooba Mufti’s mother in a money-laundering case and the former chief minister linked the move to her refusal to meet the visiting delegation. Fissures appeared in the five-party People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration fighting for the restoration of Article 370 after Mehbooba’s PDP and the Awami National Conference chose to boycott the commission, alleging that it lacks “constitutional and legal mandate” and that it has been set up to help the BJP realise its “political vision” in Jammu and Kashmir. It is widely believed in Kashmir that the BJP wants to install a Hindu chief minister in Jammu and Kashmir by granting more seats to its Hindu majority areas despite the community constituting only 25 per cent of the population. The Farooq Abdullah-led National Conference, the CPM and two other constituents of the alliance met the members of the commission, although they said they were committed to their goal of seeking the reversal of the August 5, 2019, moves to strip Jammu and Kashmir of its special status and bifurcate the state into two Union Territories. While the commission’s meeting with party representatives was under way at a highly secured hotel on the banks of the Dal Lake, Mehbooba tweeted that the ED had summoned her mother, Gulshan Nazir, to appear before it on July 14. “On a day PDP chose not to meet Delimitation Commission, ED sent a summons to my mother to appear in person for unknown charges. In its attempts to intimidate political opponents, GOI doesn’t even spare senior citizens. Agencies like NIA & ED are now its tools to settle scores,” Mehbooba tweeted. The ED letter Gulshan has received states that she has been called for an investigation under provisions of the Money Laundering Act, 2002. The letter has been signed by Sunil Kumar Meena, assistant director of ED. Earlier in the day, the PDP shot off a letter to the Delimitation Commission, headed by former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai, claiming that the panel “lacks constitutional and legal mandate in the first place and its very existence and objectives have left every ordinary resident of J&K with many questions”. “There are apprehensions that the delimitation exercise is part of the overall process of political disempowerment of the people of J&K that the Government of India has embarked on. At the very core of these apprehensions is the process through which the commission has been constituted and the fact that while the delimitation process across the country has been put on hold till 2026, J&K has been made an exception,” the letter added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-463
07-07-2021||India||Kerala sub-judge quits over social media posts ||A sub-judge in Kerala who had landed in trouble for his social media comments on several issues, including court orders, has chosen to resign rather than face disciplinary action. Sub-judge of Perumbavoor, S. Sudeep, announced his decision in a Facebook post on Monday: “I resigned today and submitted a one-line resignation letter.” He sent his letter to the Chief Justice of Kerala High Court that had served him a notice and sought his explanation based on the findings of an inquiry conducted over his social media posts. Sudeep wrote another post to condole the death of Jesuit priest and tribal rights activist Father Stan Swamy in custody on Monday. “A man who was a judge in his ‘poorvashram’ (previous abode) apologises to that man. The name of the most unfortunate man in this world is Stan Swamy,” Sudeep wrote. The judicial officer with a massive following on social media for his bold statements didn’t forget to thank the establishment he had served for 19 years. “Thanks to the establishment that gave me an opportunity to serve for 19 years. Thank you, the lamps that shed light along my path,” he wrote thanking Kerala High Court Chief Justice S. Manikumar, several district judges and others. The high court panel that probed his Facebook posts over a few years had found that Sudeep had violated a 2017 circular that restrained judicial officers from making comments on sensitive matters. The high court had earlier withheld his three increments as part of its disciplinary action. Faced with possible termination of service over his comments that were found in violation of the circular, Sudeep had on Saturday posted a lengthy take that began with: “The resignation letter is in my pocket. I shall submit it whenever it’s needed.” He went on to reproduce the five violations cited by the investigation officer who was a district judge. The first charge is based on his Facebook post in 2017 in which he allegedly hurt religious sentiments by commenting on a Hindu ritual for the departed souls. He noted that the inquiry did not find any offence in his comments. The second one was allegedly about insulting Swami Ayyappan, the deity of Sabarimala temple, with some remark on his celibacy in 2018. The third comment was one that lauded a 2018 Supreme Court judgment that allowed women of all ages to enter Sabarimala. The allegation was that he hurt the religious sentiments of traditionalists who were against the verdict since entry of women of child-bearing age was prohibited since several years. The fourth allegation was over commenting on a high court verdict that ordered the removal of flex billboards in Kerala. Sudeep noted that the inquiry commission did not find anything offensive in the social media posts. He questioned how any of his posts would come under the ambit of the 2017 circular which was found to have been violated. He said: “How does my supporting court orders and rule of law become controversial and sensitive? As an Indian citizen I am duty-bound to defend court orders and rule of law. Who can say such comments cannot be made on public platforms?” He even cited an example of what could be construed as a “controversial” statement. “Kashmir could be controversial for some, not me. If I say Kashmir is an integral part of India it is certainly not controversial. Saying the opposite is, without doubt, controversial,” he posted.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-464

The results of the two editions, which were postponed in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, are likely to be announced in August. “The third edition of JEE Main will be conducted from July 20 to 25 while the fourth edition will be held from July 27 to August 2. The exams will be conducted by following all Covid protocols and keeping the safety of the candidates in mind,” Pokhriyal said. According to an official notification issued by the National Testing Agency (NTA), the candidates who had applied for the postponed phases can modify their particulars from July 6 to 8 for the third edition and from July 9 to 12 for the fourth. “In order to address the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the number of cities has been increased from 232 to 334. The number of examination centres in every shift will also be increased from 660 to 828,” said Sadhana Parashar, senior director of the NTA. “The total number of candidates who have already registered for the April session is 6.80 lakh and 6.09 lakh for the May session,” she added. JEE Main, through which admissions are made to engineering colleges, is being conducted four times a year from the coronavirus-hit current academic session to offer flexibility to students and a chance to improve their scores. The first phase in February was followed by the second in March, while the next editions were scheduled for April and May. But the latter two were postponed after a spike in Covid cases during the second wave of the pandemic. The JEE Advanced exam, which is conducted for admission to the IITs, was also postponed.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-464

Besides acting against the people who foisted the cases on Fr Stan, the Opposition leaders also want the government to take action against those party to his continued detention and inhuman treatment. “They must be held accountable. It is now incumbent that all those jailed in the Bhima Koregaon case and other detenues under politically motivated cases, misusing draconian laws like UAPA, sedition, etc, be released forthwith,’’ said the joint letter by Opposition leaders to the President. According to the letter, Fr Stan was denied treatment for his various ailments, including the debilitating Parkinson’s disease. Detailing the various stages of his deteriorating health when he was denied treatment, the Opposition leaders sought the President’s immediate intervention in ensuring action against those responsible for his death in custody. The signatories to the joint letter are Congress president Sonia Gandhi, former Prime Minister and JDS leader H.D. Deve Gowda, chief ministers of Bengal, Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu — Mamata Banerjee, Hemant Soren and M.K. Stalin — respectively, Sharad Pawar of the NCP, Farooq Abdullah of the National Conference, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav of the RJD, CPM’s Sitaram Yechury and CPI’s D. Raja.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-464

In a statement issued in New Delhi, NLC president Mathew J. Nedumpura said the 84-year-old and ailing tribal rights activist who died in judicial custody on Monday while waiting for bail ought not to have been arrested in the first place and that no court should have remanded him in custody. “The denial of bail to Father Stan Swamy, which led to his incarceration and eventual death in a private hospital in Bombay still under judicial custody, is one of the darkest incidents of denial of the fundamental freedom of life and liberty enshrined in our Constitution,” Nedumpura said. “Even during the medieval days, the custody of a person accused was permissible only if the offences committed were so grave and such that if the person was at large he would not be available for trial and to undergo the punishment,” he added. Asserting that the sacrifice made by Fr Stan would not go in vain, the NLC hoped the judiciary, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah would take note of the injustice that had “stained” India’s image the world over. The NLC also sought the immediate release of thousands of undertrials who are languishing in jails for years, denied speedy trial. Nedumpura recalled the words of legendary English jurist William Blackstone who in his Commentaries on the Laws of England had stated that “…the guilt of a man ought not be wrung out of him, and ought to be established by other men and means, through a complete protection against self-incrimination”. Pointing out that bail is a matter of right and can be denied only if the offender is likely to commit further crimes or is a flight risk, the NLC stated that this protection against incarceration and self-incrimination that has been an undeniable facet throughout the common history of law is being denied in 21st-century India. “The octogenarian, weak and sick Fr Swamy ought not to have been even arrested and no court should have remanded him in police/judicial custody. I have no words to condemn the injustice done to Fr Stan Swamy,” Nedumpura said. “I believe the sufferings of Fr Stan will not go in vain, and that the Prime Minister, home minister and the judiciary will take note of the fact that the injustice meted out to Fr Stan has stained India’s image all over the world, and has created a dent in the faith of the common man in the judiciary. “The reforms we need are drastic, revolutionary. The worship of meaningless procedures and technicality, we must abandon. Thousands of undertrials accused of petty offences, many of which are mere fabrication, ought to be released, and it is the duty of the Bar to raise its voice against injustice,” Nedumpura added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-464
07-07-2021||India||Stan Swamy: Kapil Mishra's 'natural death' tweet disappears||A Delhi BJP leader blamed for last year’s communal riots tweeted that Father Stan Swamy deserved to be punished but later deleted the tweet. Kapil Mishra, a  former AAP minister and current BJP rabble-rouser celebrated by Hindutva extremists, had tweeted on Monday: “Very sad about the natural death of #StanSwamy. He deserved punishment by the law for the heinous crimes he committed against humanity and the nation.” On Tuesday, the tweet vanished. Asked, Mishra told The Telegraph: “I generally delete after 24 hours because some people try to report. I stand by what I said yesterday.” Replying to a question on whether his party asked him to delete the tweet, Mishra said: “He (Fr Stan) was in jail for planning to kill the PM of India. I don’t think even remotely there is a chance of sympathy in the BJP for a Naxalite…” like Stan Swamy.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-464
07-07-2021||India||Elgaar Parishad case: Evidence planted on Surendra Gadling's computer, says report||Forensic analysis has pointed to the alleged planting of evidence on the computer of another accused in the Bhima-Koregaon Maoist-links case by the “same attacker” that had targeted human rights activist Rona Wilson. The Washington Post on Tuesday published an article on the report of a US-based data forensics firm that found that Nagpur lawyer Surendra Gadling’s computer had been hacked with the NetWire malware in 2016 via email and a total of 14 documents had been planted between December 4, 2016, and October 22, 2017. One of the documents — on Maoist funding — that had allegedly been planted on Gadling’s computer in 2017 was the same as the one planted on Wilson’s computer around the same time, it said. The 14 documents deal with Maoist movements, attacks, funding through hawala channels and getting rebels released from jail. Boston’s Arsenal Consulting, quoted by The Post, has been bringing out reports on the alleged plants. The report on human rights activist Wilson had been made public in February this year. Arsenal, a digital forensic consulting company, has been cited in court by the defence team of Wilson. Arsenal’s third and latest report, on which The Post article is based, describes the evidence planting thus: “It should be noted that this is one of the most serious cases involving evidence tampering that Arsenal has ever encountered, based on various metrics which include the vast timespan between the delivery of the first and last incriminating documents on multiple defendants’ computers.” Gadling and Wilson are in jail since 2018 in the Bhima-Koregaon case. Sixteen rights activists, including Father Stan Swamy who passed away in judicial custody on Monday, have been jailed in connection with the investigation into alleged Maoist links to an Ambedkarite event on December 31, 2017, at Maharashtra’s Bhima-Koregaon that was followed by caste clashes the next day that claimed one life. Arsenal’s third report, accessed by The Telegraph, says in its summary: “Arsenal’s analysis in this case has revealed that Surendra Gadling’s computer was compromised for just over 20 months by the same attacker identified in Reports I and II. The attacker responsible for compromising Mr Gadling’s computer had extensive resources (including time) and it is obvious that their primary goals were surveillance and incriminating document delivery. “Arsenal has effectively caught the attacker red handed, based on remnants of their activity left behind in file system transactions, application execution data, and otherwise. It is important to note that Arsenal has also recovered communications with the attacker’s command and control server from Mr Gadling’s computer. “Arsenal has connected the same attacker to a significant malware infrastructure which was deployed over the course of approximately four years to not only attack and compromise Mr Gadling’s computer for 20 months, but to attack his co-defendants in the Bhima-Koregaon case and defendants in other high-profile Indian cases as well.” The Post has verified the findings with independent experts. In May, the National Investigation Agency had opposed Wilson’s plea to quash the case on the basis of Arsenal’s reports on a digital copy of electronic evidence seized from his home in Delhi. In an affidavit to Bombay High Court, the NIA had said: “However, this report does not form part of the chargesheets which are filed by the NIA and the Pune police. It is a settled position of law that documents which are not part of the chargesheet cannot be relied upon by Mr Wilson and as such there is no question of looking into the report of Arsenal Consultancy and the entire petition deserves to be rejected.” Gadling, a Dalit, was the counsel for paraplegic academic G.N. Saibaba, serving a life sentence for links to the banned CPI (Maoist), Dalit author Sudhir Dhawale and Kabir Kala Manch activists under trial in the Bhima-Koregaon case. Relatives and friends of the 16 undertrials said in a statement on Monday night: “His (Fr Stan’s) claims that these documents had been surreptitiously planted was firmly upheld through the stunning disclosures of Arsenal Consulting…. We are outraged that Father Stan had to pay the price of this malicious fabrication of evidence with his life.” The statement added: “Later, as his health continued to deteriorate in prison, his medical bail plea was mechanically turned down by the same blind, unfeeling and insensitive NIA court. Even his Covid disease was not diagnosed in jail, and could only be detected after he was moved to the hospital on orders of the (Bombay) High Court…. “While we grieve the passing away of Father Stan Swamy, we unequivocally hold the negligent jails, the indifferent courts and the malicious investigating agencies firmly responsible for his unfortunate death. We fear for the health and lives of our family members and colleagues who are facing the similar injustices in the same jails, under the same unaccountable system.” Last year rights group Amnesty International and University of Toronto’s Internet watchdog Citizen Lab had revealed that in 2019, a coordinated spyware operation was used to target at least nine human rights defenders, eight of whom are campaigning for the release of the Bhima-Koregaon 16. Also in 2019, Israeli spyware Pegasus — sold only to governments — was discovered to have been used to spy on human rights defenders by penetrating their mobile phones via WhatsApp. Under constant grilling in the Rajya Sabha, that year, communications and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had told the House: “To the best of my knowledge, no unauthorised interception has been done.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-464
07-07-2021||India||BJP lawmaker at door of seers for support against Yediyurappa||A BJP lawmaker who is leading a rebellion against Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yediyurappa has started knocking on the doors of religious institutions without whose support it has become difficult to further their cause of a leadership change. The chief minister’s bugbear, Basanagoud Patil Yatnal, who has already unleashed a no-holds barred attack to replace Yediyurappa, has been meeting some prominent seers to seek their blessings for his operation. He met the seers of Devanur mutt and Hosamutt and visited the Srikanteshwara Temple atop Chamundi Hills in Mysore on Monday as part of his plan to seek the blessings of religious leaders for his mission. But sources privy to the meetings at two of the mutts said the seers usually welcomed anyone who visited them and that alone doesn’t guarantee their support since Yediyurappa still held sway. However, Yatnal skipped Suttur mutt, an influential Lingayat institution, although dissident state minister C.P. Yogeeshwara and lawmaker Ramesh Jarkiholi had visited the seer recently. One who could never meet eye to eye with Yediyurappa, Yatnal has been a major headache for the BJP that failed in disciplining him despite several warnings against anti-party activities. “I have been elected to the Lok Sabha twice and I am not here as a lawmaker because of Yediyurappa, but because of Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s blessings,” he told reporters on Tuesday in Mysore, where he has been visiting religious leaders seeking their support to replace the chief minister. He brushed aside a question on why the party would go for a new chief minister after recently clarifying it had no such plans, Yatnal said nothing could be predicted. “Who knows if the high command would place that responsibility on my shoulders? No can discount any possibility. Did anyone expect D.V. Sadananda Gowda becoming chief minister?” Yatnal said. After Yediyurappa was forced to resign following a land scam in 2011, the party had surprised everyone by picking Gowda. “At one time no one could predict the BJP would come to power in Karnataka and Yediyurappa would become chief minister. So let’s not rule out anything,” Yatnal said. While he did not disclose how many more seers he planned to meet in the coming days, Yatnal was critical of some religious leaders and accused them of playing politics. “Mutt leaders should change to khadi from saffron since they are playing politics,” he told reporters in Mysore on Monday, alluding to some of the most powerful mutts that traditionally strengthened the hands of Yediyurappa. He met A.H. Vishwanath, another BJP leader who has been seeking a leadership change, at a hotel in Mysore setting off speculations about the dissidents coming together to take on Yediyurappa. One of the 17 turncoats who jumped ship from the Janata Dal Secular-Congress coalition to the BJP in 2019, Vishwanath had in June accused Yediyurappa of trying to use an irrigation project worth Rs 21,473 crore to get a “kickback” without even seeking financial clearance. The flurry of activity from Yatnal who even met some party leaders miffed at Yediyurappa left the BJP circles abuzz with talks about the possible impact of the latest round of rebellion brewing in the party. A party source, who requested not to be named, said they were not in a position to make matters worse. “The central leadership had already made it clear that there would be no change in Karnataka. Yet the dissents cannot be ignored since these are senior leaders. So our leaders will certainly take stock of the situation and pacify everyone,” he added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-464
07-07-2021||India||Minister Thawar Chand Gehlot appointed as Karnataka governor ||Social justice minister Thawar Chand Gehlot was appointed Karnataka governor and many leaders said to be nurturing ministerial ambitions made a dash for Delhi on Tuesday, signalling that the first cabinet expansion of the Narendra Modi government’s second term was imminent. Speculation has been rife about filling up cabinet vacancies and also going for a rejig with sources saying it could be done at 6pm on Wednesday. Gehlot had also been the leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha. Three more BJP leaders were appointed governors of Mizoram, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh, while four others were interchanged. The Rajya Sabha term of Gehlot, a Dalit leader, was to expire in 2024 and it seems likely that a new face will be elected to the Upper House for the rest of his term and that this person will also get a place in the government. The names of Trinamul turncoat Dinesh Trivedi and Congress defector Jitin Prasada are doing the rounds. A bunch of leaders who are seen as probables for cabinet berths rushed to Delhi on Tuesday after receiving phone calls asking them to come to the capital, BJP sources said. Prominent among them was Jyotiraditya Scindia, whose defection from the Congress had helped the BJP to pull down the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh last year. Scindia is expected to be rewarded with a key ministry at the Centre. Scindia was spotted offering prayers at the Mahakal temple in Ujjain on Tuesday before he left for Delhi. The BJP has already got him elected to the Rajya Sabha as he had lost his Gwalior Lok Sabha seat in the 2019 elections. Former Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who stepped aside to make way for Himanta Biswa Sarma, also landed in Delhi. Sonowal is likely to get a place in the Modi government. The leader who evoked the maximum interest, however, was Pashupati Paras, the brother of late Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan. Paras, who was seen shopping for clothes in Patna, had led a coup against Paswan’s son Chirag and the BJP helped him get appointed as the leader of the Lok Janshakti Party in Parliament. The sources said Paras had received a call from Union home minister Amit Shah to come to Delhi. “Raaz ko raaz rehno do (let the secret remain a secret),” Paras said when asked whether he had received a call for being sworn in as minister. Paswan was a cabinet minister in the Modi government at the time of his death in October last year and Paras is likely to fill the slot. Modi’s council of ministers can have 81 members. It now has 53 members, which means another 28 can be inducted. It’s unlikely that Modi will have a full house and the upcoming Assembly polls in five states, prominent being Uttar Pradesh, will be kept in mind while making the fresh inductions. The BJP sources said some ministers could be dropped or shifted to other ministries based on a review by Modi. Many ministers are now holding more than one key portfolio. BJP leaders said the exit of the 73-year-old Gehlot was also an indication that young faces could find a place in the ministry. The BJP has unofficially fixed 75 as the retirement age from active politics. The expansion plans could face a hurdle in the form of Bihar ally Janata Dal United with Nitish Kumar’s party demanding four berths, the sources said. BJP chief J.P. Nadda has been negotiating with JDU MPs R.C.P. Singh and Lallan Singh, both of whom could be inducted into the cabinet. In addition, the JDU is said to be pressing for two junior ministers, the sources said, arguing that the BJP with 17 MPs from Bihar had five central ministers from the state. The JDU is the second largest partner in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. The JDU had refused to join the government in 2019, rejecting the offer of just one berth as token representation. The BJP wants the ally to be part of the government to send out a message that it is keen on taking its partners along, particularly after losing the Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-464
07-07-2021||India||Uddhav govt brings bills to amend farm laws||The Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra on Tuesday introduced three amendment bills in the Assembly related to agriculture, co-operation, food and civil supplies, in a move to counter the new farm laws enacted by the Centre that are facing stiff opposition from farmers. The bills have provisions for higher than MSP rate for produce in farming agreement with traders, timely payment of dues, three-year jail term and Rs 5 lakh fine or both for harassment of farmers. They also have provisions to give power to the state government to regulate and prohibit production, supply, distribution and impose stock limits on essential commodities. Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said the central farm acts were passed without discussion and several of their provisions encroach on rights of state governments. “The state government has right to make laws and we want to suggest amendments to the central agriculture laws which we feel are anti-farmer,” he said. The bills which have been placed in public domain for two months for suggestions and objections are — Essential Commodities (Amendment), Farmers (Empowerment and Protection), Guarantee Price; Agriculture Related Agreements (Maharashtra Amendment) and Amendments to Central Government Farmer Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation). The draft bills have been prepared by a cabinet sub-committee headed by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. Pawar said the draft bills will be in public domain for two months during which all stakeholders can hold discussions and debates on their provisions. The bills will be taken up for discussion and passage during the winter session of the legislature in Nagpur (held in December), he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-464
