06-07-2021||India||Indian embassy in Kabul trashes reports about closing its missions in Afghanistan||The Indian Embassy in Afghanistan on Tuesday described as "incorrect" reports saying India is shutting down its diplomatic missions in the country in view of escalating violence. In a Twitter post, the embassy said it is closely monitoring the evolving security situation, particularly around the cities of Kandahar and Mazar. "Media reports on #India closing its Embassy & Consulates in AF are incorrect. @IndianEmbKabul, Consulates in Kandahar & Mazar are open, functioning. We DO HOWEVER continue to closely monitor the evolving security situation particularly around Kandahar & Mazar cities," it said. The embassy last week asked all Indians visiting, staying and working in Afghanistan to exercise utmost caution with regard to their security and avoid all types of non-essential travel in view of a rising number of incidents of violence in various parts of the country. In an advisory, the embassy said the security situation in Afghanistan remains "dangerous" and that terror groups have carried out a series of complex attacks, including targeting civilians, adding that Indian nationals additionally face a "serious threat" of abduction. Afghanistan witnessed a series of attacks in the last few weeks as the United States looked to complete the withdrawal of its forces from the war-ravaged country by September 11, ending nearly two decades of its military presence there. India is concerned over the increasing levels of violence as well as the Taliban's efforts to expand its influence in Afghanistan. Last month, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said the Taliban's relentless pursuit of power through violence has created an uncertain environment in Afghanistan and the situation in the country is "fluid" at this point in time. India has been a major stakeholder in the peace and stability of Afghanistan. It has already invested nearly USD 3 billion in aid and reconstruction activities in the country. India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process that is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled. In March, Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar visited India during which External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar conveyed to him the country's long-term commitment towards a peaceful, sovereign and stable Afghanistan.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-464

He said the rights of workers are being denied in the times of the pandemic, when they should be given financial assistance instead. "MNREGA workers in many states are not getting their wages. When the government should have given additional financial assistance to them during the pandemic, the money that is the workers' rights is also being denied. "There is a world beyond the false rhetoric where in some houses people are not able to even run their households - what kind of 'achche din' (good days) are these," he asked. His reference was to the promise of "achche din" (good days) made to the people by the BJP ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. In another tweet, he posted a query with a Hindi couplet to attack the Modi government. "Fill in the blank: Rafale of 'friends', Tax collection - expensive fuel, blind sale of PSU-PSBs, Jail if you question. The Modi government is....," he asked in Hindi. The former Congress chief has been attacking the government on various fronts, including the poor state of economy, rising inflation and unemployment, mismanagement in Covid handling and slow vaccination pace.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-465
06-07-2021||India||Quad summit in October, rising China on agenda||US President Joe Biden will host the leaders of Australia, India and Japan later this year, White House coordinator for the Indo-Pacific Kurt Campbell told Hindustan Times on Tuesday. The Quad, also known as Quadrilateral Security Dialogue is a strategic dialogue between the US, Japan, Australia and India during which the sides discuss economic and military cooperation. Its first inklings go back to 2007 but a recent resurgence is largely seen as a strategy to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region. “You will see [our cooperation] later this year when the president [Biden] hosts the Quad leaders in Washington. You'll see some commitments,” Campbell told Hindustan Times at an online event hosted by the Asia Society group. He added that the summit should bring “decisive” commitments on such issues as vaccine diplomacy and infrastructure. According to diplomats based in New Delhi and Washington, the foreign ministers of quad will exchange notes on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September to frame the architecture of the security grouping before the summit. While China calls the Quad security dialogue as the new NATO framed against Beijing, the Quad partners view it as a grouping where democratic countries can get together and cooperate to build up resilient supply chains, health architecture, disaster management and security to the shipping lanes handling trade of the world, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. What started as an instrument to ensure freedom of navigation in the South China Sea (SCS) has now become a democratic tool to help the world in vaccine supply, human disaster relief, counter-terrorism, defence and trade cooperation. The Quad summit will also discuss the role of ASEAN countries in the security groupings, as well as countries like France and the United Kingdom, which seek cooperation with quad over Indo-Pacific. According to Hindustan Times, the summit leaders will discuss developments in Afghanistan which faces threats from fundamentalist Taliban running rampage all over the country. The Taliban wants to establish an emirate in Afghanistan where Sharia laws will prevail. The Quad summit will also be looking at countries like Indonesia and the Philippines which have a huge role to play in the Indo-Pacific due to geographical locations. While Indonesia sits on all the important ingress routes to the SCS, the Philippines forms the first island chain to deep Pacific. Indonesia has proximity to Malacca, Sunda, Lombok and Ombai Wetar states that box the South China Sea, the Philippines is the first island chain after Taiwan. The Quad summit also comes at a time when China continues to be aggressive against India in east Ladakh, against Australia on trade, against Japan Senkaku islands and against the United States for the control of South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific. While the US has been operating its aircraft carriers in the South China Sea for conducting freedom of navigation operations the Chinese Navy is on the verge of building an 85,000-tonnes aircraft carrier (Type 003) to expand the footprint of PLA Navy in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-465

06-07-2021||India||Elgaar Parishad case: Swamy detained under due process of law, says Centre ||India on Tuesday rejected mounting international criticism over the handling of the case of Father Stan Swamy, an undertrial who died on Monday, saying the concerned authorities act against violations of law and do not restrain legitimate exercise of rights.  The Ministry of External Affairs said India remains committed to the promotion and protection of the human rights of all its citizens and that the country's democratic polity is complemented by an independent judiciary and a range of national and state-level human rights commissions.  Stan Swamy, who was arrested last year under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in connection with the Elgar Parishad case, died in a Mumbai hospital on Monday.  Noting that Father Stan Swamy was arrested and detained by the National Investigation Agency following due process under law, the ministry said because of the specific nature of charges against him, his bail applications were rejected by courts.  "Authorities in India act against violations of law and not against legitimate exercise of rights. All such actions are strictly in accordance with the law," MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.  His comments came in response to media queries on the demise of Stan Swamy.  In view of Father Stan Swamy's ailing health, the Bombay High Court had allowed his medical treatment at a private hospital where he was receiving all possible medical attention since May 28, Bagchi said.  The MEA spokesperson said Swamy's health and medical treatment was being closely monitored by the courts and he passed away on July 5 following medical complications.  "India's democratic and constitutional polity is complemented by an independent judiciary, a range of national and state level human rights commissions that monitor violations, a free media and a vibrant and vocal civil society," Bagchi said.  "India remains committed to promotion and protection of human rights of all its citizens," he added.  Earlier, the UN body on human rights said it was "deeply saddened and disturbed" by the death of 84-year-old activist in pre-trial detention. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet and the UN's independent experts have repeatedly raised the cases of Swamy and 15 other human rights defenders with the government of India over the past three years and urged their release from detention, it said.  "We are deeply saddened and disturbed by the death of 84-year-old Father Stan Swamy, a human rights defender and Jesuit priest, in Mumbai yesterday, following his arrest in October 2020 under India's Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act," Liz Throssell, the spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said.  "Father Stan had been held in pre-trial detention without bail since his arrest, charged with terrorism-related offences in relation to demonstrations that date back to 2018," she said in a statement.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-465
06-07-2021||India||Uddhav Thackeray dismissive about talk of patch-up with BJP||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday dismissed rumours that the Shiv Sena and BJP may come together again, and also slammed the opposition party for its conduct during the state legislature's just-concluded monsoon session. Speculation was rife in political circles in the last few days over possible reconciliation between the Thackeray-led Sena and the BJP which parted ways after the 2019 Assembly elections. “Something which didn't happen when we were together for 30 years, what can happen now,” he said to a question about whether the two parties would join the hands again. Talking to the media after the two-day session ended, the chief minister said the actions of the BJP members were not the sign of a healthy democracy. Twelve BJP MLAs were on Monday suspended from the Assembly for one year for allegedly misbehaving with presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav in the Speaker's chamber. “What was the need for the BJP to create a hue and cry over a resolution asking the Centre to provide census data of 2011 to enable the State Backward Class Commission to prepare empirical data of OBCs....should we say its animosity for OBCs came to the surface?” Thackeray asked. The conduct of BJP MLAs "made us hang our heads in shame", he said. “Even if you feel the resolution wouldn't yield anything, couldn't you still support it? What was the need to create ruckus. If the Centre is not providing us the data, how do you know there are mistakes in it,” Thackeray said. “If there were mistakes, why did the Devendra Fadnavis government seek information about it in 2019,” he asked. Monday’s ruckus was an attempt to destablize the Sena-NCP-Congress government, Thackeray alleged, adding the attempt failed and it had failed in the past too. “The BJP blames us for murdering democracy and called the MLAs' suspension a black chapter, then what are ED and CBI doing, painting the democracy white?” he further said. To a question on the pending election for Assembly Speaker, the chief minister said his government applies Covid-19 rules to itself too. “During a pandemic, the health of people and legislators is important. I underwent a Covid test on Sunday and got the report on Monday morning. (But) What about MLAs from rural areas, how can the 72-hour period for RTPCR test be implemented,” he asked. Justifying the delay in holding election for Speaker and short duration of the session, he said in two days “we could do a lot of work which will help people”.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-465

According to sources, the new cabinet is going to be the youngest ever. According to an NDTV report, the average age will be the lowest ever. More women ministers and special representation will be given to people with administrative experience. “Overall two dozen OBCs (Other Backward Class) will be represented.

Ministers who can make it to the cabinet have arrived or heading to the national capital, including the likes of Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sarbananda Sonowal, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP)'s Pashupati Paras, Narayan Rane and Varun Gandhi. Jyotiraditya Scindia was seen offering prayers at Ujjain's famous Mahakal temple, hours before he took a flight to Delhi. "I was on a visit to Ujjain. After completing my visit here, I'm going to Delhi,” Scindia was quoted in the report. Former Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, is also set to be a Union Minister. So is Pashupati Paras, who led the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) coup in Bihar against ex-Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan's son Chirag Paswan, mentioned the report.

06-07-2021||India||Govt must free activists jailed in Bhima Koregaon case, demand Opposition leaders||Senior Opposition leaders including Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee and National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah on Tuesday wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind seeking the release of all activists arrested in the 2017 Elgaar Parishad case, a day after Father Stan Swamy passed away awaiting his bail in the same case. "We are urging your immediate intervention as the President of India to direct 'your government' to act against those responsible for foisting false cases on him, his continued detention in jail and inhuman treatment. They must be held accountable. It is now incumbent that all those jailed in the Bhima Koregaon case and other detenues under politically motivated cases, misusing draconian laws like UAPA, sedition etc be released forthwith," the letter, as quoted by ndtv.com, reads. Father Stan Swamy, severely ill and at 84 the eldest prisoner in a case accusing rights activists of Maoist links, passed away in a Mumbai hospital on Monday while waiting for bail. The announcement of the Parkinson’s patient’s death came during his bail hearing in Bombay High Court. "We the undersigned leaders of major opposition parties are writing to you in deep anguish expressing our intense grief and outrage at the death of Father Stan Swamy under custody," the letter signed by ten oOpposition leaders read. Apart from the four leaders, MK Stalin, Hemant Soren, HD Deve Gowda, Tejaswi Yadav, D Raja and Sitaram Yechury also signed the letter. Stanislaus Lourduswamy was among 16 people arrested in the Elgaar Parishad case, an investigation into alleged Maoist links to an Ambedkarite event on December 31, 2017, that was followed by caste clashes the next day that claimed one life. The case expanded into a purge of “urban Naxals”, a term used by the Hindutva Right to describe academics, writers, lawyers and activists like Fr Stan who are accused of clandestinely working for the banned CPI Maoist. The case was transferred from Maharashtra police to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) soon after the BJP lost power in the western state. In May, Fr Stan had told the high court he would rather die in jail than go to the state government-run Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy Hospital again. “I would rather suffer, possibly die very shortly if this were to go on. I would prefer this than be admitted to the J.J. Hospital.... One thing that I would request the judiciary is to consider for interim bail…. Whatever happens to me, I would like to be with my own,” he had said. “When I came to Taloja (prison), whole systems of my body were very functional, but during these eight months there has been a steady but slow regression of whatever my body functions were. Eight months ago, I would eat by myself, do some writing, walk, but all these are disappearing one after another.” The Jesuit’s health had continued to deteriorate in jail after his arrest in Ranchi in October last year. He lost his hearing, fell down several times in prison, and developed spinal problems and severe abdomen pain. However, he received little sympathy from the authorities. Parkinson’s Disease having left him unable to hold a glass of water, Swamy had had to move court last November for the use of a straw and sipper in Navi Mumbai’s Taloja Central Prison. After the court gave the NIA 20 days to reply, the agency formally denied having seized the drinking apparatus Swamy had brought with him from Ranchi, shifting the scrutiny to the state authorities. Following this, the state government-run prison, which is responsible for the upkeep of all its inmates, sold a baby sipper to Swamy. Just before his arrest last year, Fr Stan had said in a video: “What is happening to me is not something unique happening to me alone. It is a broader process that is taking place all over the country. “We are all aware how prominent intellectuals, lawyers, writers, poets, activists, students, leaders, they are all put into jail because they have expressed their dissent or raised questions about the ruling powers of India. We are part of the process. In a way I am happy to be part of this process. I am not a silent spectator, but part of the game, and ready to pay the price whatever be it.” Fr Stan had denied any knowledge of the purported pieces of communication with Maoists that the NIA had, during his interrogation, claimed were from his computer.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-465

06-07-2021||India||Maharashtra Assembly demands 3 crore doses from Centre per month ||The Maharashtra Assembly on Tuesday passed a resolution, asking the Centre to provide a minimum of three crore COVID-19 vaccine doses per month to the state to reduce the impact of a possible third wave of the viral infection. Health Minister Rajesh Tope, who moved the resolution in the House, said the state machinery was well equipped to vaccinate 10 lakh people per day, provided the doses were available. "With this number, we can vaccinate three crore people in the next two months. Expediting the vaccination drive is necessary for the economic revival as well," he said. The Centre has so far provided 2,84,39,060 vaccine doses and the state government has purchased 25,10,730 doses, the minister said, adding that 3,43,82,583 have been inoculated till now. He said the state has so far conducted 4.25 crore tests for coronavirus, out of which 61 lakh have come out positive, while 1.23 lakh patients succumbed to the viral infection. After one-and-a-half years (since COVID-19 outbreak), there are 1.23 lakh active cases in the state, he said. "Maharashtra tops the list of states in the number of (COVID-19) infections, deaths and active cases. There are 21 cases of the 'Delta Plus' variant of coronavirus and 5,500 cases of mucormycosis (also known as black fungus). This is a serious situation," he said. Shiv Sena's Sunil Prabhu said the state should consider vaccinating citizens from the deprived and poor sections, as well as homeless people, who not have Aadhaar cards or other documents. Congress member Prithivraj Chavan attacked the Centre over what he claimed was "profiteering", and said a single order of vaccines for the entire nation was a must. "Who is responsible for the profiteering? No other nation has done this where people have to pay Rs 1,200 per dose (of COVID-19 vaccine). Instead of asking states and municipalities to procure vaccines, the central government should purchase vaccines through one order for the entire nation and then sell them or distribute to states,'' the former chief minister said. He said 6.5 crore vaccine doses were exported, "when we should have kept them for our own people".||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-465

According to the report, the court demanded to know if UP Police had conducted preliminary inquiries to establish Twitter India's connection to the case.

"The Congress has always been taking the leading role in tackling the challenges posed before the country. It very well knows how to discharge its role of sacrificing everything for the country," Vadra said while addressing a two-day training programme of party workers in Jhansi through video conferencing. In a statement issued by the UP Congress, she said, "Today, the situation of the country has become adverse owing to the anti-people policies of the government. Spiralling inflation, poverty, malnutrition, crime and challenges before the democratic values, Constitution and Constitutional institutions, can only be tackled by the Congress. For this, everybody has to play an active role." Urging the Congress workers to understand the pain faced by the people, Vadra said, "The history of the Congress has been to reduce the pain of every section of the country. This is our present as well as the future. Hence, our first priority is the country and the people. Stand with them, share their pain, and work hard to help them get rid of the pain." She also said that the BJP governments at the Centre and in UP have "committed the sin of pushing people into problems". The Congress will question the BJP government on inflation, unemployment, increasing prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas, and also stage protests on these issues. The government jobs are falling prey to corruption and the candidates selected for jobs are moving from pillar to post to get their appointment, she said. The Congress general secretary also said, "The BJP government has no vision. It is cheating the youth and the unemployed persons, and doing injustice. Instead of answering questions, it speaks lies, and avoids accountability." "Several crimes are taking place in Uttar Pradesh. The prominent agenda of the Yogi Adityanath government is exploitation of the Dalits, the deprived and the exploited (sections of the society). Silent support to the criminals is making the situation explosive. The government is as usual far from giving relief to the people," she further said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-466

Swamy was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) from Ranchi in October 2020 under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in connection with the Elgar Parishad case and lodged at the Taloja Central Jail in Navi Mumbai. The 84-year-old died at the Holy Family Hospital, where he was admitted on May 29, in Mumbai on Monday, a day after he suffered a cardiac arrest and was put on ventilator support. The Elgar Parishad case relates to alleged inflammatory speeches made by some activists at a conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017. Police claim these speeches triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the outskirts of the city and that the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links. "We, the friends and family members of those accused in the Bhima Koregaon conspiracy case, are deeply pained and shaken to the core by the loss of Father Stan Swamy. This is not a natural death but the institutional murder of a gentle soul committed by an inhuman state," the statement said. "Having spent his life amongst the 'Adivasis' in Jharkhand, fighting for their right to resources and lands, Father Stan did not deserve to die in this manner, far from his beloved Jharkhand, falsely imprisoned by a vindictive state," it said. "Even his Covid disease was not diagnosed in jail and could only be detected after he was moved to the hospital on orders of the (Bombay) high court," it added. Swamy was the last of the 16 people to be arrested in the Bhima Koregaon case. Suffering from Parkinson's disease, he was the oldest and the frailest among those arrested, the statement said. "While we grieve at the passing away of Father Stan Swamy, we unequivocally hold the negligent jails, the indifferent courts and the malicious investigating agencies firmly responsible for his unfortunate death. We fear for the health and lives of our family members and colleagues, who are facing similar injustices in the same jails, under the same unaccountable system," it added. The statement further said, "We continue our vigil for everyone's safety and security, and as Father Stan would appreciate, 'we refuse to be silent spectators and are ready to pay the price!'" Swamy had said he had never been to Bhima Koregaon. NIA officials had said investigations established that he was actively involved in the activities of the CPI (Maoist). The agency also alleged that he was in contact with "conspirators" to further the group's activities. Others arrested in connection with the Elgar Parishad case include some of India's most respected scholars, lawyers, academicians and activists.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-466
06-07-2021||India||Covid: SC directs Centre to test, vaccinate people at mental health homes||The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the Centre to ensure that people lodged in mental health establishments are tested for Covid-19 and are completely vaccinated at the earliest. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah took serious note of the Maharashtra government's shifting patients lodged in mental health institutes to homes for beggars and asked it to discontinue the practice immediately saying it is counter-productive and runs against the provisions of Mental Health Act. The top court also directed all the states and Union Territories to extend all cooperation and participate in the meeting of Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to be held on July 12. It asked the states/UTs to remove the discrepancies in figures submitted about the people who have been cured but are still languishing in mental health institutions or who still need treatments. The bench said that from now on it will monitor the case and would start listing the matter after three weeks as it is a very sensitive matter. The top court was hearing a plea filed by advocate Gaurav Bansal in which he has said that around 10,000 people, who are fit to be discharged, are forced to live in different mental hospitals across the country and institutes due to social stigma.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-466

The lawmakers are Elamaram Kareem, V Sivadasan, Binoy Viswam, M V Shreyams Kumar, K Somaprasad, John Brittas (Rajya Sabha) and Lok Sabha MPs Thomas Chazhikadan and A M Ariff. Two days ago, the administration had rejected the application of Congress MPs Hibi Eden and TN Prathapan seeking entry into Lakshadweep, citing the same reasons. In his order issued on Monday, Lakshadweep collector Asker Ali said the visit of parliamentarians to the islands "for political activities will certainly disturb the calm and peaceful atmosphere in the islands and it will be against the interest of the general public, public order and security of the Union Territory". Lakshadweep has been witnessing a series of protests by residents for the past few weeks against Administrator Praful Khoda Patel's decision to implement reform measures in the islands. The Save Lakshadweep Forum (SLF), a platform of protesters, has alleged that the measures were being implemented without taking people of islands into confidence. Accusing the administration of going ahead with the "anti-people reform measures" in the islands, the SLF has said they would continue their protest till such measures are withdrawn.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-466
06-07-2021||India||Amarinder Singh leaves for Delhi, likely to meet Sonia Gandhi||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday left for Delhi where he is likely to meet party president Sonia Gandhi, amid reports of factionalism in the Punjab Congress. Singh left for the national capital in a chopper from Chandigarh at around 11 am. He is expected to meet Sonia Gandhi later in the day, said sources. The meeting assumes significance as the party high command has been trying to resolve the internal rift in the Punjab unit of the Congress and there is talk of its revamp, with just months to go for the assembly polls. Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu has been at loggerheads with the chief minister, attacking him on issues like the alleged delay in the completion of a probe into the 2015 desecration of Sikh texts and the subsequent police firing on protesters. There is some speculation that Sidhu may get an important role in the planned revamp. A few days ago, Sidhu had met Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Delhi. On June 22, Singh had appeared before a three-member AICC panel headed by leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, set up to resolve the infighting in the Punjab Congress. But he returned to Chandigarh without an audience with either Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi. The panel had then asked Singh to deliver on 18 pending promises, including on the 2015 sacrilege issue and power purchase agreements signed by the previous government. The panel had earlier met other party leaders and submitted a report to the party high command. Rahul Gandhi has also met several party leaders, including legislators from Punjab, for their views on what is needed to strengthen the party ahead of the assembly polls. On June 23, AICC general secretary and party's Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat had said Sonia Gandhi would resolve all issues related to the state unit by early July and a united party would fight the next assembly elections.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-466

"Our party has decided to stay away from this process and not be a part of some exercise, the outcome which is widely believed to be pre-planned and which may further hurt the interests of our people," PDP general secretary Ghulam Nabi Lone Hanjura said in a letter to the commission. Addressed to Justice (retd) Ranjana Prakash Desai, who leads the commission, Hanjura reiterated in the letter the PDP's stand that the constitutional changes with regard to Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019 were made "illegally" and "unconstitutionally". Hanjura said the party believes the commission lacks constitutional and legal mandate and its very existence and objectives have left the people of Jammu and Kashmir with many questions. The Reorganization Act being a product of the same process, we are of the considered opinion that the Delimitation Commission lacks constitutional and legal mandate in the first place and its very existence and objectives have left every ordinary resident of J&K with many questions, he said. There are apprehensions that the delimitation exercise is part of the overall process of political disempowerment of the people of J&K that the government of India has embarked on. At the very core of these apprehensions is the process through which the commission has been constituted and the fact that while the delimitation process across the country has been put on hold till 2026, J&K has been made an exception," he added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-466

Union Minister Thaawarchand Gehlot was appointed as Karnataka Governor and Mangubhai Chhaganbhai Patel were named as the Governor of Madhya Pradesh, according to a Rashtrapati Bhavan communiqu . The announcement comes amid reports of Union Cabinet reshuffle. Gehlot, a Rajya Sabha member from Madhya Pradesh, is the Social Justice and Empowerment Minister.

06-07-2021||India||IT Rules: Delhi HC censure on Twitter for delay||The Delhi High Court Tuesday directed Twitter to inform it by July 8 as to when it will appoint a resident grievance officer in compliance with the new IT Rules after the microblogging platform submitted that it was in the process of doing so. Justice Rekha Palli took exception to the fact the court was not informed that the earlier appointment of the resident grievance officer (RGO) was only on interim basis and he has already resigned. The high court pointed out that only an interim RGO was appointed by Twitter and a wrong impression was given to the court on May 31 as it was not informed that the officer was on interim basis. If he went away on June 21, the least Twitter could do was to appoint another officer in these 15 days since you knew that this matter was coming up for hearing on July 6. We are considered with the compliance. How long does your process take? If Twitter thinks it can take as long it wants in my country, I will not allow that, the judge said. Senior advocate Sajan Poovayya, representing Twitter, said though Twitter is in process of making the appointment, it was true that as on date there is no chief compliance officer, RGO and nodal contact person. So as the court said yes Twitter is not in compliance of rules as of now. But it is in the process of appointing the officer. When an intermediary is not in compliance of rules, it loses safe harbour protection. It is indeed that Twitter should and Twitter will comply with the rules. Please grant a reasonable time, he said. Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, representing the Centre, said the rules were notified on February 25 and three-month window was given to the intermediaries to comply with the rules, which has expired on May 25. We are on July 6. It is a 42-day complete non-compliance. They are most welcome to do business in India. But this attitude cocks a snook to the digital sovereignty of this country, he argued. To this, the judge said, I have already told them they have to comply with the rules. I am not giving them any protection. If they are in defiance, you are free to take action. I have already made it clear if they want to work, they have to follow rules. When the ASG went on saying that there is 42-day non-compliance and the government has not taken any action, the court said I don't think you are making these submissions for me. During the hearing, the court passed over the matter for a while, asking the Twitter's counsel to take instructions on how much time will it take to complete the process of appointment. However, when the matter was again called up, Poovayya said due to the time difference between Delhi and San Francisco, where Twitter Inc's office is situated, he was unable to take instructions and sought a short accommodation. The high court granted time till July 8 and said, it is expected that on the next date of hearing, Twitter's counsel will be ready with its stand regarding compliance with all other requirements. Come up with clear instruction, otherwise you will be in trouble, it said, adding that Let the government and everybody else know your stand. The court noted that on May 31, when the petition claiming non-compliance with the Centre's new IT Rules by the microblogging platform, came up for hearing, Twitter's counsel on instructions had submitted that in compliance of the IT Rules, it has already appointed a RGO on May 28. In view of the statement, it was permitted to file a short reply, the court said, adding that after perusing the affidavit, it came to know that as on May 31, the platform had only appointed an interim grievance officer, which fact was not brought to the court's notice. Regarding the petition, Twitter's counsel said the petitioner's grievance was that two tweets needed to be pulled down and Twitter has said that it is unable to conclude that the tweets were defamatory. To this, the court said it will deal with this prayer later on and right now it was concerned with the prayer on compliance of IT rules.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-467

A bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana said that it would not interfere with the directions passed by the state government under the Disaster Management Act. The apex court was hearing a batch of pleas filed by individuals and groups, including the Odisha Vikas Parishad, challenging the Odisha government's decision to cancel the Rath Yatra (except at Puri Jagannath Temple) because of the Covid-19 pandemic. According to a report by ndtv. com, the central government had also wanted Rath Yatras to be held at other places in the state. Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said this could be done without upsetting health protocols. "We are sorry. We also feel bad," the bench said. "We hope and trust God will allow the Rath Yatra next time., the bench said. "I also go to Puri every year... but have not gone for the last one-and-a-half years. I do puja at home... and it can be done at home. (The state) government has taken the right decision," CJI Ramana said. The Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath in Puri is an annual ritual and this time, it is scheduled for July 12. The state has allowed Rath Yatra only at Jagannath Puri.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-467

While the state reported a spike of only 46 cases against 93 Covid recoveries on the day, at least two more patients, one each from Gumla and East Singhbhum, died during treatment, a bulletin from the National Health Mission (NHM) stated. The two fresh casualties reported on Monday took the Covid toll in Jharkhand to 5,117 and that in East Singhbhum to 1,038. However, Ranchi, which has reported 1585 Covid casualties so far, continues to be the worst-affected district in Jharkhand in terms of Covid caseload and fatalities. With recoveries outnumbering fresh cases on Monday, the active caseload in Jharkhand dropped to 609, the NHM stated in its daily Covid bulletin. While none of the 24 districts in Jharkhand reported a double-digit-spike in cases, at least nine districts – Ramgarh, Pakur, Koderma, Jamtara, Hazaribag, Godda, Garhwa, Dumka and Chatra – did not report fresh cases of coronavirus infection on the day. By the end of Monday, there were 100 active cases of Covid-19 in Ranchi, while all the remaining 23 districts had fewer cases.

Bokaro reported three cases against four recoveries and Dhanbad reported two cases against three recoveries. The state on the day tested swab samples of 49,659 residents and less than 0.1 per cent of them were found infected by the deadly virus. As per government data, over 3.45 lakh people have contracted Covid-19 in the state so far and 98.34 per cent of them have recovered.

06-07-2021||India||Modi's meeting with Union ministers stands cancelled amid Cabinet expansion buzz||Amid speculations of a possible Cabinet expansion, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with the BJP top brass has reportedly been cancelled. According to a report by ndtv.com, the meeting, which had been scheduled at 5 pm on Tuesday, would have gone forward with the agenda of a discussion on the performance of ministers and proposals on future schemes. Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and other Union Ministers including Dharmendra Pradhan, Pralhad Joshi, Piyush Goyal and Narendra Singh Tomar were likely to attend the session. On Monday too, Modi held marathon meetings with Shah and BJP general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh in what is being seen as the final touches being given to the details of a likely expansion of the Union Cabinet. Sources said Shah and Santhosh confabulated with Modi at his residence for several hours on Sunday amid a "strong possibility" that the Cabinet reshuffle may happen very soon. Some sources said the swearing-in may happen as early as Wednesday. However, there was no official word on it. If the prime minister goes ahead with the exercise, he will be expanding his Council of Ministers for the first time since assuming the charge in May 2019 for his second innings. BJP leaders Sarbananda Sonowal, the former Assam chief minister who made way for Himanta Biswa Sarma in the state, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Sushil Modi are seen as strong ministerial probables amid indications that some allies of the saffron party may also get berths. The states which will go to the assembly polls early next year, including the all-important Uttar Pradesh, may figure high. West Bengal may also see its representation in the Union Council of Ministers go up, the sources said. It is believed that the BJP's allies like JD(U) and Apna Dal can also get representation. Presently, Republican Party leader Ramdas Athawale, a junior minister, is the only ally in the government after parties like the Shiv Sena and the Shiromani Akali Dal severed ties with the BJP. Lok Janshakti Party founder Ram Vilas Paswan, a Cabinet minister, had died last year and all eyes are on whether his brother Pashupati Kumar Paras will be part of the expansion. Paras is engaged in a bitter battle with Paswan's son Chirag Paswan for the control of the party and has been recognised as the LJP leader in Lok Sabha after five of its six MPs lent their support to him. The current strength of the Council of Ministers is 53, besides Modi, and its maximum number can be 81. For the last few weeks, Modi has been meeting Union ministers in groups with BJP president J P Nadda also being present in the exercise to review their works and gather feedback. The BJP brass has also held organisational meetings in different states.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-467

Mookerjee led a campaign against Article 370, which gave special powers to Jammu and Kashmir, and died under detention in the erstwhile state in 1953. He was born in Calcutta in 1901. The Jana Sangh was the progenitor of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which was founded in 1980. The Modi government nullified Article 370 in 2019, fulfilling a foundational agenda of the BJP. In a tweet, Modi said, "I bow to Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee on his Jayanti. His lofty ideals motivate millions across our nation. Dr. Mookerjee devoted his life towards India's unity and progress. He also distinguished himself as a remarkable scholar and intellectual."||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-467
06-07-2021||India||Elgaar Parishad case: Swamy death news greets bail hearing in HC||Father Stan Swamy, severely ill and at 84 the eldest prisoner in a case accusing rights activists of Maoist links, passed away in a Mumbai hospital on Monday while waiting for bail. The announcement of the Parkinson’s patient’s death came during his bail hearing in Bombay High Court. The court was also due to hear the Ranchi-based Jesuit and tribal rights defender’s plea challenging provisions of the anti-terror Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), which many activists in India and abroad have termed a draconian law and under which bail is a rarity. Stanislaus Lourduswamy was among 16 people arrested in the Elgaar Parishad case, an investigation into alleged Maoist links to an Ambedkarite event on December 31, 2017, that was followed by caste clashes the next day that claimed one life. The case expanded intoa purge of “urban Naxals”, a term used by the Hindutva Right to describe academics, writers, lawyers and activists like Fr Stan who are accused of clandestinely working for the banned CPI Maoist. The case was transferred from Maharashtra police to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) soon after the BJP lost power in the western state. As the bail hearing began on Monday afternoon, Ian D’Souza — medical superintendent of the Holy Family Hospital, Bandra — told the division bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and N.J. Jamadar that Fr Stan had passed away at 1.24pm. Fr Stan had been on a ventilator since Sunday after suffering a cardiac arrest. His lawyer Mihir Desai demanded a judicial inquiry into alleged negligence by the NIA and the prison authorities. For now, the body has been sent for post-mortem. In May, Fr Stan had told the high court he would rather die in jail than go to the state government-run Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy Hospital again. “I would rather suffer, possibly die very shortly if this were to go on. I would prefer this than be admitted to the J.J. Hospital.... One thing that I would request the judiciary is to consider for interim bail…. Whatever happens to me, I would like to be with my own,” he had said. “When I came to Taloja (prison), whole systems of my body were very functional, but during these eight months there has been a steady but slow regression of whatever my body functions were. Eight months ago, I would eat by myself, do some writing, walk, but all these are disappearing one after another.” The Jesuit’s health had continued to deteriorate in jail after his arrest in Ranchi in October last year. He lost his hearing, fell down several times in prison, and developed spinal problems and severe abdomen pain. However, he received little sympathy from the authorities. Parkinson’s Disease having left him unable to hold a glass of water, Swamy had had to move court last November for the use of a straw and sipper in Navi Mumbai’s Taloja Central Prison. After the court gave the NIA 20 days to reply, the agency formally denied having seized the drinking apparatus Swamy had brought with him from Ranchi, shifting the scrutiny to the state authorities. Following this, the state government-run prison, which is responsible for the upkeep of all its inmates, sold a baby sipper to Swamy. This treatment prompted Congress leader P. Chidambaram — who had widened the scope of the UAPA as Union home minister — to castigate the coalition government in Maharashtra where his party is a partner. Chidambaram had tweeted: “Are the administrators of the Jail department and especially the DG, Prisons so bereft of human compassion that they cannot provide straws to the old and ailing prisoner?” The state government has since ignored pleas from civil society to recommend interim bail and release for the Elgaar prisoners — most of them aged and ailing — to the high-powered committees mandated by the Supreme Court to decongest prisons during the pandemic. Despite statements from internationally renowned activists and human rights advocates every few weeks in the last three years seeking better treatment of the accused, the NIA has consistently opposed bail pleas in the case. Another co-accused and academic Hany Babu M.T. had to move court for his spectacles, and is now in hospital after an eye infection. Prison superintendent Kaustubh Kurlekar, who had asked the Elgaar defendants to be shifted out of his jail as they were making “false complaints”, was transferred out this weekend. The Jesuits — shy of making political statements to the media — had found a novel way of championing Fr Stan’s cause by leaking excerpts of his letters written to friends and fellow clergymen. One of these had asked for prayers for Telugu litterateur Varavara Rao, now out on bail after his health and mental faculties deteriorated rapidly. Rao’s family has blamed the poor sanitation in jail and alleged his urinary catheters had remained unchanged for months. The suffering had failed to sap Fr Stan’s courage or darken his mood. “Despite all odds, humanity is bubbling in Taloja prison,” he had written in a letter, saying he was being fed and bathed by co-accused Vernon Gonsalves, a former professor, and Arun Ferreira, a cartoonist and lawyer. Fr Stan had been charged with handling funds for the Persecuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee, which the NIA has termed a front for the CPI Maoist. He was later also accused of Maoist activity through the Vistapan Virodhi Jan Vikas Andolan. Fr Stan was publicly involved with both organisations, documenting the plight of tribal youth in Jharkhand who were jailed as Maoists for participating in protests against forcible land acquisition. This alleged bagman of a terror group had only a table, three chairs, a cupboard and a bed to his name, which were attached by a court in 2019 when he failed to appear to answer a case against his support for a legal code for the Adivasis’ Sarna faith. Just before his arrest last year, Fr Stan had said in a video: “What is happening to me is not something unique happening to me alone. It is a broader process that is taking place all over the country. “We are all aware how prominent intellectuals, lawyers, writers, poets, activists, students, leaders, they are all put into jail because they have expressed their dissent or raised questions about the ruling powers of India. We are part of the process. In a way I am happy to be part of this process. I am not a silent spectator, but part of the game, and ready to pay the price whatever be it.” Fr Stan had denied any knowledge of the purported pieces of communication with Maoists that the NIA had, during his interrogation, claimed were from his computer. As his condition worsened in jail, he was moved to the Holy Family at his own expense on May 30. He tested positive there for Covid, days after he was given the vaccine in jail. The virus eventually left him, but other ailments were aggravated and eventually his heart failed. His last public act before dying was to challenge the UAPA, a plea that lapsed with his death before it could be argued. His writ petition challenges Section 43D(5) as unconstitutional as it creates a de facto ban on the grant of bail. His plea also challenges the use of the term “front organisation” and argues that not only is this not backed by law but it violates fundamental rights. Delhi-based activist Rona Wilson, another co-accused lodged in Taloja, had asked Bombay High Court in February to quash the case on the basis of a data forensics report by an American firm that said key elements of the purported evidence had been planted on his computer through Internet malware.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-467
06-07-2021||India||People express shock on Father Stan Swamy's death||People from all walks of life expressed shock on the death of Jesuit priest and tribal rights activist Father Stan Swamy in a Mumbai hospital on Monday. Fr Stan, 84, was arrested by the National Investigation Agency in 2020 in connection with the Bhima Koregaon-Elgar Parishad case. While paying glowing tributes to Fr Stan, they also condemned the treatment meted out to him by the central agency and the jail authorities. Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren tweeted: “Shocked to learn about the demise of Father Stan Swamy. He dedicated his life working for tribal rights. I had strongly opposed his arrest and incarceration.” “The Union government should be answerable for absolute apathy and non-provision of timely medical services, leading to his death,” Soren added. Vasvi Kiro, former member of the Jharkhand Women’s Commission who knew Fr Stan closely, said: “Stan who belonged to Tamil Nadu worked for the demand of jal (water), jangal (forest) and zameen (land) of the tribals of Jharkhand, reminding us of Che Guevara who also went to fight for people of a different country.” “Knowing him for a long time, I know for sure he never went to that area, let alone getting involved in the Bhima Koregaon case,” she added. Kiro alleged the central government “murdered” a 84-year-old priest who was suffering from several ailments “by falsely implicating him in a case he was never involved in and denying him proper treatment when he needed it most”. “The powers that be are always against those siding with the tribals,” she further said, reminding that “even Birsa Munda was murdered in jail in 1900”. Miners’ rights activist Xavier Dias said: “Life was his key word. Stan fought for the right of life so that everyone gets the joy of life. I never found him compromising on this.” Dias knew Fr Stan since mid-seventies. Dias said he met him when he was a student in Bangalore and Stan was the director of Indian Social Institute there. JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said: “Everyone respected him and no one believes Father Stan Swamy could be involved in that case. It was a part of the design of the central government for suppressing the intellectuals and dedicated workers who fight for the causes of the oppressed.” The Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha, a joint forum of activists and NGOs that Fr Stan helped to form, said in a statement: “His death is the result of murder by state. We hold the NIA and the central government wholly responsible and strongly condemn their role in Stan’s death, which once again exposes the fascist face of the BJP government at the Centre.” Describing Fr Stan as a fighter for justice and a symbol of courage, Archbishop Felix Toppo and auxiliary Bishop Theodore Mascarenhas, in a statement issued on behalf of the Ranchi Catholic Archdiocese, said: “The fact that this sick man suffering with Parkinson’s disease was arrested at the age of 84, refused bail for over seven months, not even allowed a sipper and finally contracted Covid in jail itself is a sad reflection on those who got the innocent man arrested and the courts that refused him bail.” Carnatic musician and culture critic-activist T.M. Krishna, said in a Facebook post: “Just heard that Stan Swamy passed away. The Indian Government and our insensitive Judiciary are responsible for all that he went through towards the end of his life.” “An 84-year-old person suffering from Parkinson’s disease who was denied even a straw and sipper, had to go to court for just that and still wait for over a month to be given that little aid. We are a vile nation,” added Krishna. DMK MP Kanimozhi tweeted: “Poraligal Vithaikapadugirargal, Puthaikapaduvathillai (Fighters are sown, not buried),” along with a picture of the priest. “Stan Swamy (84), who suffered from Parkinson’s, was arrested by the BJP government as Anti-national. His health conditions were never considered. He slipped into coma and passed away,” Kanimozhi, who is also the DMK women’s wing secretary, added. The United Christian Forum of North East India on Monday expressed its deep pain and anguish at the demise of Fr Stan. The forum said he was “falsely” implicated, imprisoned and “made” to suffer because of his mission and work among the Adivasis, Dalits and other marginalised communities, as he believed, that the poor must have life and life to the full, with honour and dignity, as enshrined in the Constitution. Northeast has over 78 lakh Christians. Nagaland, Mizoram and Meghalaya are Christian-dominated states. While offering their condolences to those who stood by Fr Stan and prayed for him during this “moment of trial and suffering”, forum spokesperson Allen Brooks said community members have pledged to recommit themselves to take forward the legacy of Fr Stan and to “work” for peace, justice and reconciliation.

06-07-2021||India||Covid cluster detected after two from India attend US wedding||A cluster of four Covid-19 cases detected after two guests from India attended an open-air wedding near Houston, Texas, has underlined the capacity of the Delta coronavirus variant to cause infections in recipients of multiple vaccines. Genome sequencing of viruses from the six patients — all vaccinated — suggests the Delta variant may be able to evade immune responses in patients who have received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or India’s Covaxin, researchers at the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, said. Joseph Petrosino, director of molecular virology, and his colleagues probed six Covid-19 cases in April that occurred soon after a wedding gathering in a large, open-air tent with 92 attendees, for which the guests required to be fully vaccinated. They found that a man, designated patient “0a”, and a woman, designated patient “0b”, both in their 60s, had travelled from India to Houston to attend the wedding, 10 days after receiving their second Covaxin doses. The woman complained of fatigue on the first night of the wedding. The man developed a cough two days after the wedding and both developed a fever after three days. Both tested positive for Covid-19 four days after the wedding. Four other patients with breakthrough infections who tested positive confirmed having close encounters with patients 0a and 0b during the wedding. Two of them had received the Pfizer vaccine, while the other two had received the Moderna vaccine. “Encounter timings and viral sequence similarities suggest that the strain containing the Delta variant was transmitted to wedding guests from two patients travelling from India,” the BCM researchers said in a research paper not peer-reviewed yet but posted on medRxiv, a pre-print server, on Sunday. Their study suggests that antibodies elicited in patients who had received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and Covaxin may provide decreased immunity to the Delta variant. It is possible that some individuals in the study had failed to produce an effective immune response, the researchers said. Patient 0a was admitted to a hospital where his symptoms continued to worsen and where he died a month later. In an independent study conducted across three hospitals in Delhi, researchers have found that the Delta variant not only dominated infections among vaccinated healthcare workers, it could also spread rapidly among fully vaccinated healthcare workers. Medical researchers say the findings from both the Houston and Delhi studies highlight the importance of continuing precautions such as wearing a mask and avoiding crowds even after vaccination. “These results should be eye-openers for fully vaccinated people that they cannot lower their guard,” said Chand Wattal, the chair of clinical microbiology and immunology at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, one of the three participating hospitals in Delhi. But public health researchers say that despite the emergence of breakthrough infections, all observations to date show a strong protective effect of the vaccines against severe disease. Lab studies have shown that vaccine-elicited antibodies are effective against coronavirus variants. “Partial efficacy of current vaccines (70 to 75 per cent coverage) is theoretically sufficient to stop a pandemic,” Petrosino and his colleagues said in their paper. “Slowing the spread could prevent the emergence of future variants, hastening the end of this pandemic.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-467
06-07-2021||India||Covid: CBSE to bifurcate Class X and Class XII exams in 2022||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will hold the board exams for Class X and Class XII in two parts in 2021-22 in view of the pandemic affecting activities in schools. According to the special scheme for 2021-22, the academic session will be divided into two terms, each covering about 50 per cent of the syllabus. Subject experts will do this by looking into the interconnectivity of concepts and topics. There will be a board exam at the end of each term on the basis of the bifurcated syllabus. “This is done to increase the probability of having board-conducted Classes X and XII examinations at the end of the academic session,” the circular said. The first-term exam will be held by the CBSE between November and December 2021 within a window of four to eight weeks. The specific dates will be notified later. The question papers will have multiple-choice questions on the 50 per cent syllabus and the duration will be 90 minutes. The question papers will be sent by the CBSE to the schools along with the marking scheme. External superintendents and observers appointed by the CBSE will supervise the process. The answer sheets will be sent to the board’s portal and evaluated automatically. The marks will be uploaded by the school the same day. The second-term exam will be held around March-April 2022. The papers will be of two-hour duration and carry questions in different formats such as case-based, situation-based, open-ended short answer or long answer. However, if the situation is not conducive for a normal descriptive examination, a 90-minute exam based on multiple-choice questions similar to the first-term exam will be conducted at the end of the second term. Marks obtained in both exams will contribute to the overall score. The venue of the exams will depend on the situation. If the students can go to the schools or the centres, the CBSE will conduct both the tests there. If the schools remain closed completely during November-December 2021, the first-term test will be done online or offline from home. In such a case, the weightage given to this exam in the final scores will be reduced. If the schools remain closed during March-April 2022 after the first-term exam has been held at the schools or the centres, the final results will be based on students’ performance in the first-term exam and internal assessments. If the pandemic forces a complete closure of the schools and both the exams are taken from home, the results will be computed on the basis of the internal assessments or practicals or project work and theory marks obtained through the tests taken from home. In such a situation, the theory marks will be moderated to ensure the reliability of the assessment. Educationist Usha Ram welcomed the decision and said it was the best possible option to ensure the students remained safe while being subjected to assessment. “The division is there, anyway. The schools conduct half-yearly tests; now the board will conduct it. Like the college system, the students will have two semesters. It’s a welcome move. They have done this to ensure the safety of the students and announce the results without much difficulty,” Ram said. The details of the bifurcated syllabuses and guidelines for internal assessment (IA) for all subjects will be notified this month. The schools will continue teaching in the distance mode till they are allowed to open by state authorities. For Classes IX-X, the internal assessment will include three periodic tests, student enrichment, portfolio and practical work or speaking and listening activities or projects. For Classes XI-XII, the internal assessment will include unit tests or exploratory activities or practicals or projects.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-468

Antony on Monday expressed outrage at the attempts to bury the Rafale scam, arguing that the Narendra Modi government will not be able to escape accountability now. Referring to the new revelations and start of investigations in France, the former defence minister said: “The subsequent series of events and documents placed in public record have now affirmed the stance of the Congress party about wrongdoing and corruption in the Rafale deal. What is, indeed, mysterious is the fact that despite 48 hours having lapsed, the Prime Minister and the defence minister have decided to maintain complete silence on ordering of investigation into the Rafale deal by the French Public Prosecution Services.” Antony, who had stalled the deal during the Manmohan Singh government when the BJP raised suspicions about the existence of a middleman, said: “The simple question is why has the government chosen to remain mum? Why have the Prime Minister and the defence minister not come forward to react on the shocking and sensational development of a corruption probe in the Rafale deal by the Public Prosecution Services of France? Can the Modi government escape accountability for corruption allegations by its intriguing silence? Is it not the responsibility of the government to come forward and accept the truth?” He added: “This is even more important as 36 aircraft are being purchased by the Modi government under an ‘inter-governmental agreement’ and one party to the agreement, that is, the French government, has proceeded to order an investigation through a judge. The only way forward is to accept accountability and order a free and fair JPC (joint parliamentary committee) probe into the entire set of facts, evidence and allegations of corruption in Rafale deal.” Antony had raised serious questions about the deal, particularly the violation of laid-down procedures, in the past as well. Arguing that corruption in the Rafale deal was prima facie apparent, Antony said: “The intriguing silence of the Modi government points towards mal-intent to hush up the corruption. The refusal of the BJP government to probe and punish the guilty is even more astonishing, pointing towards a concerted effort to bury the scam.” Rahul Gandhi also posted on Twitter a video in which a journalist of the French news portal Mediapart is seen asserting that former President Fracois Hollande clearly said he had no choice in selecting Reliance as the partner, with this message, “Truth can’t be silenced. Unlike ‘Modia’.” Antony recalled that Modi had unilaterally announced the purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft without going through any tender process in complete derogation of the “Defence Procurement Procedure” and said: “Every defence expert was shocked by this unilateral order which is India’s biggest defence deal. It was even more surprising because there was an ongoing negotiation for purchase of 126 Rafale aircraft in pursuance of an international tender, which envisaged 108 aircraft to be made in India by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and 18 aircraft to be purchased in fly-away condition. This international tender for 126 aircraft also envisaged the all important ‘transfer of technology’ to India.” He added: “Till today, neither the Prime Minister nor the BJP government have explained the reason for reducing the number of aircraft from 126 to 36 or the reason for sacrificing transfer of technology to India. The BJP government has also not explained the basis or the reason for enhancing the price of the 36 aircraft or for denying the offset contract to the government’s PSU, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. The BJP government has also not stated the reason for the fact that when clearance from ‘Defence Acquisition Council’ had been given and there was an ongoing tender for which negotiations were being finalised, how could the Prime Minister and the government unilaterally enter into another agreement?”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-468
06-07-2021||India||'Friendship' with the BJP 'intact' despite a divorce: Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut on Monday said their “friendship” with the BJP was “intact” despite a divorce, signalling a thaw that is being seen as the result of a determined effort by the BJP to destabilise the Opposition alliance government in Maharashtra. Raut’s remarks came a day after BJP leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said his party and the Shiv Sena, a former ally, were “not enemies”. The BJP has been trying to pull down the Opposition government in Maharashtra since ally Shiv Sena broke away and joined the NCP-Congress to form the government in the key state after the polls in November 2019. The earlier efforts were focussed on splitting the parties in the alliance and also driving a wedge between the partners in power, but the latest move appears to be centred on weaning away Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray by offering the chief minister’s chair to him, according to sources. “We are not like India-Pakistan. Look at Aamir Khan and Kiran Rao. It is like them. Our (Sena, BJP) political ways are different but the friendship will remain intact,” Sena leader Raut said on Monday. This was in response to Fadnavis’s statement a day earlier. “We were never enemies...,” Fadnavis said when asked whether the two former allies were coming together. “There are no ifs and buts in politics. Decisions are taken as per the prevailing situation,” he added. The latest move to gain power in Maharashtra is believed to have been initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he had a one-on-one meeting with Uddhav in Delhi last month. The meeting came in the backdrop of strains in the three-party ruling alliance. After the meeting, the Sena fuelled speculation by talking about “deep personal relations” between Modi and Uddhav. Many saw the Sena’s dalliance with the BJP as a tool to leverage its dominance in the ruling alliance. However, internally, BJP leaders indicated towards a serious effort to win back its old partner. Not much information has trickled down as the effort is believed to be led by the Prime Minister, but many in the party aver that the expansion of the Modi cabinet has been held up to accommodate the Shiv Sena if a deal is finalised. In the Modi-led move, sources said, the BJP is also ready to sacrifice the chief minister’s chair, baring the desperation to dislodge the Opposition government in Maharashtra. Though some key party leaders denied such an offer, but speculation is refusing to die down. The Shiv Sena, which fought the November 2019 polls in alliance with the BJP, had claimed the chief minister’s chair and had snapped ties after it was denied. The BJP has not been able to come to terms with its failure to gain power in a state such as Maharashtra despite winning the polls in alliance with the Sena. Apart from capturing power, which remains the primary motive, party insiders said the effort was to get back the Sena, a natural ally. “The Shiv Sena and the BJP’s ideology is the same. We are natural partners,” one BJP leader said, adding that sooner or later the Sena will break out and align with the BJP.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-468
06-07-2021||India||J&K: People’s Alliance demands statehood before polls||The alliance fighting for restoration of special status of Jammu and Kashmir on Monday belatedly announced that the recent meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi was disappointing and said Assembly elections must be held only after statehood is restored. The alliance has also decided to reach out to other parties who favour restoration of statehood and seek their support for evolving a common position — which is that statehood should precede the elections. Leaders of the five-party People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration met for the first time here to discuss the outcome of the June 24 all-party meeting with Modi, the first outreach towards Jammu and Kashmir politicians after the August 5, 2019 abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the state into two Union Territories. “All the members of the PAGD expressed their disappointment at the outcome of the Delhi meeting,” CPM state secretary M.Y. Tarigami, the alliance’s spokesman, said in a statement. Tarigami said Delhi has not taken any confidence-building measures such as releasing political and other prisoners from jails or taken concrete steps “to end the siege & atmosphere of suppression that has choked J&K since 2019”. “This would have initiated the much needed process of reaching out to the people of J&K who are the biggest stakeholders & sufferers of the J&K problem,” the statement said. It said the BJP had committed on the floor of Parliament to restore statehood and they “must honour their word”. “So any Assembly election must be held only after restoration of full statehood for J&K. To this end, the PAGD has decided to reach out to other political parties in J&K with a view to taking a common position on the issue,” Tarigami said. Earlier, the National Conference, which is the key constituent of the alliance, had favoured Assembly elections after restoration of statehood, indicating the party was warming up for business with the Centre that is firmly against any rethink on Article 370. It seems that other parties are now also favouring the option. National Conference MP from Anantnag, Hasnain Masoodi, said there was now consensus within the alliance that Assembly elections should follow the restoration of statehood. “For that we thought we should reach out to other parties who do not agree with us in seeking restoration of the August 4 position (restoration of Articles 370 and 35A) but want restoration of tatehood. What is wrong if we join hands for that and fight for statehood only after elections,” Masoodi told The Telegraph. The Modi government has promised to restore statehood but favours delimitation, which will carve out more seats, and Assembly elections to precede that. It is widely believed the Centre wants to allot more seats to Hindu-majority areas of Jammu through delimitation so that its goal of getting a Hindu chief minister is fulfilled. It perhaps explains why the Centre is ready to give statehood after elections. Masoodi said his party is committed to restoration of autonomy (the 1952 position when the state had its own Prime Minister) but parties in the alliance have their own positions. “Despite our position on autonomy, the parties of the alliance have come together for restoration of Article 370. Now we want to join hands with those who are at least fighting for restoration of statehood,” he said, clarifying they are also ready to talk to Jammu-based groups. Tarigami said it was the considerate view of all alliance partners that the meeting with the Prime Minister was disappointing. “The chairman of the alliance, Farooq Abdullah, had called for a meeting immediately after our return from Delhi. But Mehboobaji was busy with some personal engagements for which the meeting was delayed. Otherwise, we all believe that the meeting was disappointing because Government of India has not given us any concrete assurance, a confidence-building measure which can generate some hope,” he told this newspaper. “We raised the question of releases (of prisoners). The home minister (Amit Shah) said the LG (lieutenant governor) has been told to review the cases. For the last many days, how many prisoners have been released?” Tarigami said the only good thing about the meeting was that the Prime Minister reached out to the politicians for the first time in years. “It was a good beginning. Till yesterday we were a gang and now all of a sudden we have become respectable. This is the little change but then there is a question of delivery.” The alliance met on Sunday evening under Farooq’s leadership in the presence of vice-chairperson Mehbooba, Tarigami, Masoodi, Javed Mustafa Mir and Muzaffar Ahmed Shah. The alliance has reiterated its commitment to fight together to reverse the “unconstitutional and unacceptable changes foisted on the people of J&K on 5th August, 2019, using all constitutional, legal and political means at its disposal”.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-468
06-07-2021||India||Lalu blames Centre for destroying economy and communal harmony||A frail-looking Lalu Prasad returned to active politics after three-and-a-half years on Monday, accused the BJP-led central government of destroying the economy and communal harmony, and took pot shots at chief minister Nitish Kumar. “They (the Sangh parivar) are shouting slogans about (a Krishna temple in) Mathura after (the Ram temple in) Ayodhya. What’s the matter? What do they want?” the 74-year-old Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief said. “They want to destroy the country for the sake of power. We are already battling economic problems, and efforts are being made to damage the social fabric.” Lalu, who is in daughter and Rajya Sabha member Misa Bharti’s house in Delhi, was addressing his party’s 25th foundation day celebrations in Patna after digitally inaugurating it. This was the former chief minister’s first public address since being convicted in various fodder scam cases in December 2017 and January 2018 and jailed. He received bail in April this year and has since been in Delhi, undergoing treatment for various ailments. Lalu’s return to public life seems to have perked up RJD leaders and workers, who see in the development the beginning of the end of the state’s NDA government. Nitish has a thin majority while Lalu is a master at using his mass appeal to build new political equations. The RJD chief’s speech was punctuated with huge cheers from the Patna gathering, with many party supporters teary-eyed. Lalu said he was ill but would return to Patna soon. “I shall make my presence felt not only in Patna but every district of the state. Be patient,” he said. Lalu appealed to party workers to strive to strengthen the country’s social fabric. “The country has been pushed backward. We are continuously regressing. Compensating it will not be easy,” he said. “Inflation has broken the back of the common man. Poverty reigns. They are selling the railways, airlines and other things at throwaway prices. This is not good for the country.” Lalu claimed the public would have brought everything to a standstill had so much inflation been witnessed during his rule. He said his tenure reflected the “rule of the poor”, which had overturned the traditional idea of the government and given deprived communities the opportunity to go to the polling booths. “We will prefer to be broken down and destroyed but will not retract our steps. The bread was being baked on just one side for centuries in Bihar; I overturned it. Those who disliked this made noises about a ‘jungle raj’, but my government was the government of the poor,” Lalu said. He compared the Covid pandemic to Judgement Day and expressed concern about the predicted third wave. “So many people have died of Covid in the country. A large number of people died in Bihar too in the absence of treatment. No facilities were arranged,” Lalu said. Attacking Nitish, he said: “Not a single day passes without three to four murders in Bihar. Corruption is at its peak. Our state lags behind. Lakhs of people from here are forced to go to other states as migrant labourers.” He added: “I have seen five Prime Ministers and helped form their governments. I never bothered about becoming a Union minister. Nitish was fretting about it, so I got him appointed a (Union) minister.” Lalu’s wife and former chief minister Rabri Devi, who is with him in Delhi, too participated in the event along with Misa. His sons — leader of the Bihar Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and Hasanpur MLA Tej Pratap Yadav — Bihar party chief Jagadanand Singh and other senior leaders attended the physical function in Patna and delivered speeches.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-468
06-07-2021||India||Supreme Court declines ‘toolkit’ plea against Congress||The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain a petition seeking deregistration of the Congress for allegedly creating a “toolkit” to blame the Narendra Modi government for the massive loss of lives during the pandemic, saying no such order can be passed as India is a “democracy”. “...If you don’t like the toolkit, ignore it. It’s all part of a political propaganda,” a bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah told advocate Shashank Shekhar Jha who had filed the petition. Jha had sought a probe by the National Investigation Agency into the alleged “toolkit” circulation and deregistration of the Congress if the allegations were found to be true. Jha had filed the petition on the ground that the alleged toolkit had lowered the country’s image in the globe as he claimed the Congress chose to brand the coronavirus as an “Indian variant”. The advocate argued that even Singapore had taken an exception when a certain strain of the virus was described by some people as the “Singapore variant”. “But, India is a democracy, right,” Justice Chandrachud quipped. Justice Shah said the plea of the petitioner cannot be entertained under Article 32 of the Constitution. Under Article 32 a person can move the Supreme Court directly for his or her fundamental right. In the present case the court felt no fundamental right of the petitioner was violated by the purported toolkit. “Why should we issue directions in petition under 32? People have remedy in criminal law,” the bench said. “Mr Jha, please withdraw this. You may pursue your remedies under appropriate law,” the bench added, following which the petitioner chose to withdraw the petition. The alleged “toolkit” was at the centre of a controversy in May. While BJP leaders had accused the Congress of creating it to defame the government, the Opposition party rejected the allegation outright and filed police complaints accusing the BJP of forging it. It sought forensic examination of the “toolkit” and a fair investigation. BJP leaders’ posts on the purported “toolkit” were marked as manipulated media by Twitter, triggering loud protests from the ruling party.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-468
06-07-2021||India||Activists blame govt for Father Stan Swamy's custodial death||Activists and academicians on Monday blamed the government for the custodial death of tribal rights activist Father Stan Swamy and demanded immediate release of political prisoners languishing in jails. Historian Ramachandra Guha called the death a “judicial murder” while economist Jean Dreze saw it as cruelty by the “Indian state”. “Father Stan Swamy spent a lifetime working for the dispossessed and the disadvantaged. His tragic death is a case of judicial murder, for which the Home Ministry and the courts are jointly culpable,” Guha tweeted. Dreze said: “This is a sad day for all his friends and a tragedy for the country. Stan was a wonderful human being and an exemplary citizen. His death is the culmination of a series of acts of abominable cruelty on the part of the Indian state.” Rights activists Walter Fernandes and Enakshi Ganguly said Fr Stan’s fault was that he was working for the poor tribal people and against corporates. “Swamy was working on issues of human rights of tribal youths who have been jailed in false cases. He was working on issues related to land, displacement and bonded labour. This was not liked by the corporates and the State. They brought false charges against him,” Fernandes said. He said all those arrested in cases related to the Bhima Koregaon incident and the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act must be released. “The time has come for all to work for the release of activists jailed in different cases and also work for the freedom and rights of the common people for whom the jailed activists have been fighting,” he said. Ganguly said Fr Stan fought for the idea of an inclusive and just India.“He died declared an anti-national under the draconian (anti-terror law) UAPA. Not just that despite his age and ill health the treatment meted to him in jail amounted to torture. Is this death or murder by his own country?” Ganguly asked. Social activist Nikhil Dey, who works with the Mazdoor Kishan Shakti Sangathan in Rajasthan, said the cases were framed against Fr Stan because of political vendetta. “All these cases are because of political vendetta. The government is using the UAPA indiscriminately to crush dissent and any kind of opposition. Such misuse of the law is in a way a threat to the law itself. Whenever it (UAPA) would be used, including genuine cases, it would be seen with suspicion,” Dey said. He said Fr Stan was a man who stood for the rights of prisoners and of tribal people. “If the government had great evidence against him, it should have produced them in the court and fast-tracked the trial. He was no threat to the State. He did not do anything unlawful. Yet UAPA was invoked against Swamy,” Dey said. The Peoples’ Union for Civil Liberties said Fr Stan unceasingly and fearlessly exposed how the then BJP-ruled state government in Jharkhand and police had imprisoned thousands of Adivasis for years in jail without bail only because they opposed the destruction of dense forests and handing over tribal land to corporates for mining and industrial projects. “We strongly condemn the totally callous, insensitive and vengeful approach of the prosecution authorities to the prayer for interim bail to Fr Stan and other prisoners like him who suffered medical conditions making them vulnerable to Covid infections while inside prison,” the PUCL said in a statement. The All India Kisan Sabha and National Platform for the Rights of the Disabled also expressed anguish over Fr Stan’s death.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-468
06-07-2021||India||Supreme Court's dictum of bail as 'rule' and jail as 'exception' flouted||The Supreme Court’s 1977 dictum that bail is the “rule” and jail the “exception” is more often breached than honoured by the lower courts, legal experts said on the day 84-year-old Father Stan Swamy died in Mumbai waiting for bail. Contacted by The Telegraph, Justice Madan B. Lokur, former Supreme Court judge, said Father Swamy’s death was “very unfortunate and tragic” and regretted that Indian courts tended not to follow the Supreme Court’s prod. Senior advocate Colin Gonzalves said Delhi High Court’s grant of bail to Natasha Narwal and Gauhati High Court’s relief to rights activist Akhil Gogoi were exceptions, the “general trend” being for courts to go by what the central government told them. “Knowing Stan Swamy as a friend, knowing him as a peace-loving activist for decades, I feel very bitter that the courts treated him the way they did,” Gonzalves told this newspaper. “Ultimately, a good man has died. A good person has died in jail because of somebody’s negligence. And I do hope that the person responsible for the negligence understands it. It is unforgivable.” In State Of Rajasthan, Jaipur vs Balchand @ Baliay, the apex court had on September 20, 1977, laid down that bail should be the “rule” for the accused and that they should be remanded in jail only in exceptional circumstances. The judgment, authored by Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer, has been reiterated in many apex court orders. Sections 436 to 439 of the CrPC deal with the grant of bail to accused as well as convicts who appeal before a higher court. As a norm, bail is easier to secure in less heinous cases and more difficult in cases related to offences like murder, attempt to murder, rape, terrorism or narcotics. In the Balchand case, the apex court had held: “The basic rule is bail, not jail, except where there are circumstances suggestive of fleeing from justice or thwarting the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating offences or intimidating witnesses and the like by the petitioner who seeks enlargement on bail from the court. “When considering the question of bail, the gravity of the offence involved and the heinousness of the crime which are likely to induce the petitioner to avoid the course of justice must weigh with the court.” In 2012, in the Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee Representing Undertrial Prisoners v Union of India, the apex court had ruled that prisoners cannot be detained indefinitely pending trial. Once it becomes obvious that a timely trial is not possible and the accused has suffered imprisonment for a significant length of time, courts would ordinarily be obliged to free them on bail, the top court had held. On February 1 this year, the bench of Justices N.V. Ramana (presently Chief Justice of India), Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose had ruled that an accused is entitled to bail even under stringent anti-terror and narcotic laws when there is little possibility of the trial being completed early. The bench had granted bail to K.A. Najeeb, facing trial in Kerala under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for allegedly chopping off a professor’s hand. The National Investigation Agency had approached the apex court for cancellation of Najeeb’s bail, granted by Kerala High Court. “Even in the case of special legislations like the (now repealed) Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987, or the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, which too have somewhat rigorous conditions for grant of bail, this court... enlarged the accused on bail when they had been in jail for an extended period of time with little possibility of early completion of trial,” the apex court said. “The constitutionality of harsh conditions for bail in such special enactments has thus been primarily justified on the touchstone of speedy trials to ensure the protection of innocent civilian.” The apex court had agreed with the NIA that the charges against Najeeb were serious but noted that he had already spent five years in jail and there was no likelihood of the trial concluding anytime soon. The bench also noted that 276 witnesses were left to be examined. Justice Lokur said the courts should consider bail a matter of right unless there are compelling reasons to deny the relief. “All the three agencies — courts, investigating agencies and prosecution — must take a compassionate view while considering bail,” he said. Justice Lokur said the existing CrPC provisions gave “enough room” to courts to grant bail and there was little need to tweak them to ensure more liberal grant of bail. Under Article 141 of the Constitution, the law laid down by the Supreme Court is binding on all civil and judicial authorities of the country, including the high courts. Yet the courts have in recent times tended to put more faith in the contentions of the prosecuting and investigating agencies, Gonzalves told this newspaper. He said people “must learn to stand up to the tyranny” of the central government.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-468
06-07-2021||India||Father Stan Lourduswamy: Jesuit priest devoted to tribal rights ||Father Stan Swamy, who died aged 84 in Mumbai on Monday, was a Jesuit priest with a Marxian understanding of society and its problems that he imparted to thousands of youths while campaigning for tribal rights for over five decades. Stanislaus Lourduswamy, which was his real name, was best known for his championing of the Adivasi cause in Jharkhand but hailed from Tamil Nadu. He was born on April 26, 1937, in Trichy and went to St Joseph’s School, where he was so deeply inspired by the work of the Jesuit priests that he decided to join the order. He began pursuing religious studies in May 1957 and committed himself to the cause of the poor and downtrodden. In 1965, he was sent to St Xavier’s High School in Lupungutu, Chaibasa, West Singhbhum, in present-day Jharkhand for his regency, the stage at which trainee Jesuits spend two years taking up assignments for the order. “The real breakthrough with regard to his ideas about social action came when he began his regency,” said Father Peter Martin, a Ranchi-based advocate who had been associated with Fr Stan for more than two decades. “His experiences as a teacher and hostel prefect had a deep impact on him. He would visit the weekly bazaar in Chaibasa on Tuesdays with his students and saw for himself how the merchants and their agents cheated the Adivasis.” On holidays, Fr Stan visited his boys and their families in their villages. It gave him a sense of their culture. The values they held deeply impressed him. “Another decisive turn came after his regency, when he went to Manila in the Philippines in 1967 to study theology. He did a master’s in sociology. Some of the subjects dealing with indigenous peoples gave him a greater understanding of how indigenous peoples were exploited in various regions of the world, and of their struggles,” Fr Martin said. After Fr Stan returned to India and joined the Jesuit Jamshedpur Province in 1971, he was assigned the responsibility of director of the Catholic Relief Services charity for the area (Sundernagar on Jamshedpur’s outskirts). He spent 1971 and a part of 1972 setting up a warehouse for relief supplies and arranging for a vehicle and an office. He trained his ex-students to do office work and handle the distribution of relief materials. During this period, he attended a three-month course on community development at the Indian Social Institute, Bangalore, and kept in touch with the director, Father Henry Volken. “He told the then head of the Jamshedpur Jesuit Province, Father Bill Tome, that he wanted to live in an interior Ho (a tribe) village, learn their language and get to know their world,” Father Tony PM, another Ranchi-based Jesuit, who had been associated with Fr Stan since 1993, said. “Swamy moved to Badaibir village of West Singhbhum. One of the families readily offered him a room. He contacted youths within a radius of about 15km and helped them think critically about their lives in all its dimensions. Soon enough, some of his ex-students and some volunteers with backgrounds in the All India Catholic University Federation joined him.” The early and mid-1970s saw an upsurge of students and youths across the country as Jayaprakash Narayan called for civil disobedience. The Indian Social Institute in Bangalore became a hub for university students looking for an alternative vision of society. They asked the institute to teach them the fundamentals of Marxian analysis of society. Fr Volken proposed that Fr Stan head the Indian Social Institute. “But Father Swamy felt he needed to study more about social analysis. He got a scholarship to the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium for a year (1974-1975),” Fr Tony said. “Although he could have gone on to do a doctorate, he felt he should come back and take on the new role of (helping) youth from the exploited sections understand society and its dynamics scientifically and develop effective strategies of action to bring about change.” Fr Stan then had a fairly long stint — 1975 to 1990 — at the Indian Social Institute, where together with Dr Duarte Barreto and other committed colleagues he reached out to several hundred young men and women from the fringes of society through systematic training sessions. He followed it up with field action. Participants from various parts of India and neighbouring Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal began to attend his three-month course on social analysis and community organisation. The Indian Social Institute also published a series of booklets on social analysis. “Some members of the Catholic hierarchy were upset by the institution’s ‘Marxist leaning’. But the Jesuit superiors stood by the team. Father Swamy’s efforts to train people in scientific social analysis and his lived example of taking the side of the oppressed has inspired many social activists in South Asia and beyond,” Fr Martin said. In 1991, Fr Stan decided to return to his “first love”, the Adivasis of Jharkhand. Returning from Bangalore, he put up with the Jesuit community of St Xavier’s High School in Lupungutu while working to revive the Jharkhandi Organisation for Human Rights (Johar). He later moved into the office of the organisation, which began championing popular causes and reviving the traditional self-governance (Munda-Manki) system of Ho society. Simultaneously, Fr Stan began contacting social activists and socially committed people. “Towards the end of the 1990s, the phenomenon of Adivasis and moolvasis being displaced from their land became rampant. Other Jesuits also became involved in mass struggles,” Fr Tony said. “The Netarhat Field Firing Range project in the Palamu and Gumla districts and the Koel-Karo Dam in Ranchi and West Singhbhum were threatening large-scale displacements. Jesuits involved in social action felt the need to establish a centre in Ranchi to coordinate the efforts of (social) organisations and movements fighting the processes of marginalised communities becoming pauperised. Stan Swamy was given the responsibility of creating this centre.” In June 2001, Fr Stan moved to Ranchi from Chaibasa and took up residence at Gharana Apartment, Purulia Road. He contacted various organisations and movements to coordinate their struggles against displacement. The Ranchi Jesuit Province agreed to give an acre of land on the campus of the Agriculture Training Centre, Namkum, on Ranchi’s outskirts for the proposed social action centre, Bagaicha. Fr Stan began looking for an Adivasi architect to design the structure, and the central zone of the Jesuits took on the responsibility of financing the construction. Work began in 2004 and was completed in 2006. Fr Stan lived in Bagaicha since then till the NIA took him away on October 8 last year. In the mid-2010s, the Munda Adivasis of Jharkhand’s Khunti district began erecting in their villages stone slabs inscribed with the provisions of Schedule Five of the Indian Constitution which grants special autonomy to tribal areas. This came to be known as the Pathalgadi movement and was a nod to the age-old tradition of demarcating ancestral plots by erecting stone slabs that commemorated the ancestors’ contributions. However, the then BJP government of Raghubar Das termed the movement “anti-development and anti-national” and deployed police and paramilitary troops to suppress it, triggering a social media furore. The state government filed sedition cases against 20 activists, including Fr Stan, on the basis of their Facebook posts stating the government should engage in peaceful dialogue with the Adivasis engaged in the Pathalgadi movement rather than repress it. In January 2021, three months after Fr Stan had been arrested and lodged in a Mumbai jail, he was awarded the Mukundan C. Menon Award 2020 for human rights activism.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-468
06-07-2021||India||SC shocked on Information Technology Act still being used||The Supreme Court on Monday expressed “shock” and “amazement” over the manner in which people were still being booked under Section 66A of the Information Technology Act that was declared unconstitutional by the apex court way back on March 24, 2015. “It’s amazing and shocking. That’s what I can say. Shreya Singhal is a 2015 judgment. What is going on in the country is terrible,” Justice R.F. Nariman observed after senior advocate representing the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) brought to the court’s notice the continuing foisting of cases under the scrapped section and courts taking cognisance of the same. The Justice Nariman-led bench also comprised Justices K.M. Joseph and B.R. Gavai. Attorney-general K.K. Venugopal, on behalf of the Centre, sought two weeks’ time to file the Centre’s counter-affidavit on the matter. According to PUCL, 745 cases filed under Section 66A of the IT Act are pending in different courts till date. PUCL has in its petition urged the apex court to direct the Centre to collect data on FIRs, investigations or pending cases in which Section 66A has been invoked. During the hearing, Venugopal submitted that Section 66A is still there in most of the law books. “When police have to register a case, the section is still there with only a footnote that mentions that the Supreme Court has struck it down. There has to be a bracket in 66A with words struck down,” the country’s highest law officer said. “You file a counter as it is a shocking state of affairs,” Justice Nariman told the AG. According to PUCL, the Supreme Court had in a subsequent order on February 15, 2019 directed the states and Union Territories to desist from invoking Section 66A, but the police continue to file cases under the provision. “…the applicant discovered that Section 66A of the IT Act has continued to be in use not only within police stations but also in cases before trial courts across  India,” the PUCL stated. PUCL said the information was available on www.zombietracker.in — a website developed by a team of independent researchers. The website provides information of such cases and acts as a tool for convenient mapping of the use of Section 66A of the IT Act across India. The findings of the website reveal that as on March 10, 2021, as many as 745 cases are still pending and active before the district courts in 11 states wherein the accused persons are being prosecuted for offences under Section 66A of the IT Act. Hence, the PUCL has sought the following directions: ⚫ Direct the Union government to ensure full compliance immediately with Shreya Singhal through issuance of appropriate circulars/advisories addressed to the chief secretaries of all states and Union Territories, and the DGPs of all states and Union Territories, or equivalent officers thereof for onward circulation to the police stations; ⚫ Direct the Supreme Court Registry to dispatch a copy of Shreya Singhal v. Union of India to all high courts to pass appropriate orders in pending cases concerning Section 66A of the IT Act as well appropriate circulars, bringing Shreya Singhal to the notice of all district courts within their jurisdiction to prevent failures of justice; ⚫ Direct Centre to collect and furnish data for all prosecutions invoking Section 66A after March 24, 2015 before the apex court in order to secure compliance with Shreya Singhal On March 24, 2015, the Supreme Court came down heavily on the tendency of the authorities to jail individuals for posting “offensive” material on social networking sites and struck down the controversial Section 66A of the IT Act as being “unconstitutional” and in violation of the freedom of expression and speech guaranteed by Article 19(1) (a) of the Constitution. While striking down the legislation, the apex court had said the provision had been vaguely defined to bring under its ambit any form of opinion expressed on the Internet. This can be chilling deterrent on free speech, the apex court had said. However, no one has been convicted so far under the provision, though dozens of persons are incarcerated in jails under the impugned offence. Besides Section 66A, the court had struck down Section 118(d) of the Kerala Police Act, which provided for a similar punishment.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-468
06-07-2021||India||Stan's death to bring India’s rights record into global focus again||The custody death of Father Stan Swamy on Monday is likely to bring India’s rights record into focus again in western capitals where there is considerable alarm at New Delhi’s slide on human rights as well as democracy. As the western world woke up to the news, offices and individuals tasked with monitoring human rights across the world were quick to respond. “India: I am very saddened to hear that Fr #StanSwamy has passed away. A defender of indigenous peoples’ rights. He was held in detention for the past 9 months. The EU had been raising his case repeatedly with authorities,” tweeted Eamon Gilmore, the European Union’s Special Representative for Human Rights. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders (HRDs), Mary Lawlor, who had been keeping an eye on Swamy’s condition, tweeted: “The news from #India today is devastating. Human Rights Defender & Jesuit priest Fr Stan Swamy has died in custody, nine months after his arrest on false charges of terrorism. Jailing HRDs is inexcusable.” Last night, Lawlor had expressed concern about Swamy’s condition after learning that he was on life support. She had articulated the hope that the octogenarian priest would be provided specialist treatment. From Washington, the Chair of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, Nadine Maenza, tweeted: “Heartbreaking: death of Indian prisoner Father Stan Swamy after he got Covid. He was elderly priest & human rights activist imprisoned on false terrorism charges. USCIRF spoke out against his arrest & when he was denied bail as his health deteriorated.” Swamy’s death was picked up by most major international media houses and will add to the corpus of negative coverage India has been attracting, particularly over the Modi government’s handling of the second wave of the pandemic.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-469
06-07-2021||India||Elgaar Parishad case: Glare on sudden NIA transfer by Modi govt||The tragic death of 84-year-old tribal rights defender Father Stan Swamy has brought the politics behind the Elgar Parishad case into focus as many politicians, activists and intellectuals condemned it as “murder” by State. The Narendra Modi government had abruptly transferred the case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) as soon as the new Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government in Maharashtra declared its intention to review it. Ironically, the previous state government led by the BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis and the Centre had vehemently opposed the plea in the Supreme Court to transfer the case to the NIA. The somersault of the Modi government came when the Congress and the NCP openly campaigned for review of the Elgar Parishad case, describing it as a BJP conspiracy. NCP veteran Sharad Pawar wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray suggesting a special investigation team be set up to examine the case in the wake of allegations that Pune police had cooked up evidence to frame activists critical of the RSS-BJP. The activists were accused of plotting the assassination of Prime Minister Modi. The Congress and NCP had even publicly objected to Uddhav’s decision to give consent to the NIA to take over the case. The then Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh said in public the chief minister overruled him as the Congress-NCP wanted to resist the attempt of NIA’s intervention by moving court. The NIA takeover dashed the hopes of the arrested activists who had thought the change of regime in the state would facilitate delivery of justice. In fact, two arrested persons — criminal lawyer Surendra Gadling and poet Sudhir Dhawale — even moved Bombay High Court, challenging the case being transferred to the NIA in February this year, arguing that the decision was politically motivated. The plea cited a petition filed by historian Romila Thapar, economist Prabhat Patnaik and other intellectuals before the Supreme Court in August 2018, where the Centre had defended the role of Pune police in the investigation. Thapar’s petition had argued that a case involving a plot to assassinate the Prime Minister and the accused from so many states required an investigation by a central agency like the NIA or CBI. Solicitor-general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Fadnavis government, fiercely opposed the demand, saying the court should be loath to entertain a writ petition of this nature when the investigation of a serious crime was in progress according to statutory provisions. Mehta submitted that the investigation was being conducted responsibly and impartially and strictly in accordance with the law. Another top lawyer, Harish Salve, appearing for the complainant (who filed the FIR), argued that the court must enquire whether the investigation was regarding such unlawful activity or was merely to stifle dissenting political voices. “If it is the former, the investigation must be allowed to proceed unhindered,” he said. He added that the court must lean in favour of appointing an SIT or an independent investigating agency only when the grievance made is one about the investigation being derailed or being influenced by some authority. After such illuminating arguments on behalf of the Centre and the BJP government in Maharashtra, the home ministry’s inexplicable decision to suddenly transfer the case to the NIA after the BJP was ousted from the state was bound to attract criticism. Former Union minister Jairam Ramesh tweeted on Monday: “Who in the apparatus of the Indian state will be held responsible for this tragedy? Make no mistake — it is the Indian state that killed Fr Stan Swamy, who was such a passionate crusader for social justice.” Rahul Gandhi tweeted: “Heartfelt condolences on the passing of Father Stan Swamy. He deserved justice and humaneness.” While Pune police had already filed a chargesheet in the case, followed by a supplementary chargesheet, the Centre didn’t think between 2018 and 2020 that the NIA’s intervention was needed. The NIA dealt with the activists, who had no criminal record, without any compassion, so much so that Fr Stan, a Parkinson’s disease patient, had to move court to be allowed a straw and a sipper. Fr Stan’s bail plea was forcefully opposed by the NIA despite his serious illness. Yet, it did not seek his custody for interrogation, asking him to be sent to judicial custody.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-469
06-07-2021||India||The letter Stan wrote before being led away||Father Stan Swamy had expected his arrest and written a letter from his home, Bagaicha, near Ranchi, on October 8, 2020, which was forwarded to right activists, lawyers and journalists just hours before he was taken away by a team of the National Investigation Agency. Excerpts from the note follow. Sentences in bold letters had been made so by Fr Stan. I was interrogated by the NIA for 15 hours during a span of 5 days (July 27, 28, 29, 30 Aug. 6). Apart from my bio-data and some factual information, several extracts allegedly taken from a computer implicating my connection to Maoist forces were placed before me. I told them all these are fabrications stealthily put into my computer and I disowned them. The nature of the present NIA investigation of me has nothing to do about Bhima Koregaon case in which I have been booked as a ‘Suspected-accused’ and consequently raided twice (28 August 2018 and 12 June 2019). But it had everything to do to somehow establish (i) that I am personally linked to extremist leftist forces, (ii) that, through me, Bagaicha is also related to some Maoists. I denied both these allegations in strongest terms. After six weeks of silence, I am being summoned to appear in the NIA office in Mumbai. I have informed them (i) that I fail to understand the need for interrogating me further given the fact I have been subjected to that for 15 hours already, (ii) that I am not in a position to undertake the long journey given my age (83) and the nature of the epidemic ravaging the country. Besides, Jharkhand State Govt. has given a directive that during the lockdown period elderly persons above the age of 60 may not appear in public, (iii) that if the investigating agency wants to interrogate me further it can be done through video-conference. IF NIA will refuse to consider my request and insist that I go to Mumbai, I'll tell them that it will not possible for me to go for the above reasons. Hoping human sense will prevail. If not, I/we must be ready to face the consequences. I would just add that what is happening to me is not unique. Many activists, lawyers, writers, journalists, student leaders, poets, intellectuals and others who stand for the rights of Adivasis, Dalits and the marginalised and express their dissent to the ruling powers of the country are being targeted. Grateful to all who have stood in solidarity with me all these years. Attached is a note on the questions that I have been raising — What is the ‘crime’ I'm supposed to have committed? Stan Swamy What is the ‘crime’ I'm supposed to have committed? Stan Swamy, Jharkhand During the past three decades, I have tried to identify myself with the Adivasi People and their struggle for a life of dignity and self-respect. As a writer, I have tried to analyse the different issues they are faced with. In this process I have clearly expressed dissent with several policies, laws enacted by the govt in the light of the Indian Constitution. I have questioned the validity, legality, justness of several steps taken by the govt and the ruling class. I have questioned the non-implementation of the 5th Schedule of the Constitution (Indian Constitution, Article 244(1) which clearly stipulates that a ‘Tribes Advisory Council’ (TAC) composed solely of members from the Adivasi community who will advise the Governor of the State about any and everything concerning the protection, well-being and development of the Adivasi people in the State. I have asked why the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act… has been neatly ignored which for the first time recognized the fact the Adivasi communities in India have had a rich social and cultural tradition of self-governance through the Gram Sabha. I have expressed disappointment at the silence of the govt on Samatha Judgment, 1997 of the Supreme Court. The judgment was meant to provide some significant safeguards for the Adivasis to control the excavation of minerals in their lands and to help develop themselves economically. I have cried aloud at the half-hearted action of govt on Forest Rights Act, 2006… meant to correct the  historic injustice done to the Adivasi and other traditional forest-dwellers. I have queried why the govt is unwilling to carry out the SC order 'Owner of the land is also the owner of sub-soil minerals' ... and continues auctioning coal-blocks to industrialists without a due share to owners of the land. I have expressed my apprehension at the recently enacted Amendment to 'Land Acquisition Act 2013' by Jharkhand govt  which sounds a death-knell for Adivasi Community. This does away with the requirement for "Social Impact Assessment' and allows the govt to give away even agricultural and multi-crop land for non-agricultural purposes. I have strongly disagreed with the setting up of  ‘Land Bank’ which I see as the most recent plot to annihilate the Adivasi people because it claims that all 'gair-majurwa' land ('Commons') belong to the govt and it is free to allot it to anybody (read industrial houses) to set up their small and big industries. I have challenged the indiscriminate arrest of thousands of young Adivasis and Moolvasis under the label of ‘naxals’ just because they question and resist unjust land-alienation and displacement. I've taken  legal action against the Jharkhand State by filing a PIL in the HC praying that (i) all Under-Trial Prisoners (UTP) be released on bail on personal bond, (ii) speed up the trial process which surely will acquit most of them, (iii) appoint a judicial commission to probe the reasons why the trial process is indefinitely being delayed, (iv) the police submit all needed information about all UTPs to the petitioner. It is now more than two years since the case was admitted but the police is yet to provide all needed information about all UTPs. This, I believe, is the main reason why the State is keen to put me out of the way. The most feasible way is to implicate me in serious cases and stall the judicial process to give justice to the poor innocent Adivasis.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-469
