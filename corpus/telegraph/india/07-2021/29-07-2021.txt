Senior Congress leaders A K Antony, Mallikarjun Kharge, Kamal Nath, Ambika Soni, Harish Rawat, K C Venugopal and some others attended the meeting held at Gandhi's residence here on July 22, they added.  The main agenda of the meeting convened by Gandhi was to discuss the pros and cons of having the poll strategist in the party and what role should be assigned to him if he joins the Congress, the sources said.  Most of the leaders who attended the meeting agreed that Kishor joining the Congress would be beneficial for the party, they added.  Prior to this meeting, Kishor met Gandhi on July 13. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was also present at that meeting. Since then, there has been speculation about the poll strategist joining the Congress.  There has been no official word on it from the party or from Kishor.  After the West Bengal Assembly polls earlier this year, Kishor had said he would quit working as an election strategist. He had joined the Janata Dal (United) a few years ago, but had parted ways with the Nitish Kumar-led party subsequently.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-378

It also accused the BJP MPs of "collectively insulting" Parliament by their behaviour in the meeting of the Standing Committee on Information and Technology which was postponed on Wednesday due to lack of quorum. Referring to the government's proposal of working out a solution for the smooth running of Parliament, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said, "I am making a proclamation here, you start the discussion in Parliament today and by tomorrow we will discuss everything else. Why are you avoiding Pegasus?" He said the government was not answering the simple question whether it had bought Israeli Pegasus spyware to snoop upon Indians or not. "The government is not only hiding, they have much to hide, they have no answers, they have no basis for not even having a discussion inside Parliament," Singhvi told reporters. "The government is avoiding a discussion in Parliament as it knows that we will pin them down." The Congress spokesperson claimed that he does not understand how the opposition is being blamed for the logjam as it is clearly the government that is avoiding a discussion on the Pegasus issue inside Parliament whereas many countries have ordered investigations into the matter. Parliament has failed to transact any business due to opposition uproar over the Pegasus and farmers issues ever since the Monsoon Session started on July 19. Singhvi alleged the government is "feeding the media blaming the opposition on the current impasse in Parliament because it wants to avoid the real answer on whether it has acquired Pegasus and whether it uses it against any person". That is the only question that is relevant, he said. "Please consider who is hiding, who is running, who is filibustering. The government has done all of this. Having done all of this, they are blaming us. You did something wrong because of which you are hiding," Singhvi alleged. "Did you acquire Pegasus software and did you use it against anyone? If yes, please disclose their names. This question can be answered by yes or no," he said, adding the government has instead given 10 answers alleging that this is a conspiracy and a hoax. Referring to the lack of quorum for a meeting of the Standing Committee on Information and Technology, Singhvi said that he has never seen 10 people of the ruling party standing and saying that they are present but will not mark their presence. A number of members of the committee sat in Parliament on Wednesday to discuss 'Citizens' safety and date protection'. However, BJP members of the panel who were present in the meeting room didn't sign the attendance register in protest leading to a lack of quorum. "It is collectively an insult to the institution of Parliament. They are not only hiding. They have much to hide. They have no answers, no basis for discussion," the Congress leader alleged. An international media consortium has reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on a list of potential targets for surveillance using Israeli firm NSO's Pegasus spyware. Opposition leaders including Rahul Gandhi, two union ministers -- Prahlad Singh Patel and Railways and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, businessman Anil Ambani, a former CBI chief, and at least 40 journalists are on the list on the leaked database of NSO. It is, however, not established that all the phones were hacked.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-378
29-07-2021||India||We support all peace initiatives in Afghanistan: India||India on Thursday said it has a steadfast policy to support a sovereign, democratic and peaceful Afghanistan and is in touch with various stakeholders within and outside the war-ravaged country, including regional and international partners. The comments by Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan in the Rajya Sabha came in a written reply to a question a day after India and the United States strongly pitched for an immediate intra-Afghan peace process to end violence in the country and find a political settlement. Muraleedharan said India supports all peace initiatives leading towards a lasting political settlement through an inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled process. Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said at a media briefing that a unilateral imposition of will by any party will not be democratic and cannot lead to stability, noting that India is closely monitoring the developments in Afghanistan. The Taliban has been making rapid advances across Afghanistan by resorting to widespread violence since the US began withdrawing its troops on May 1. The US has already pulled back the majority of its forces from the country and is looking to complete the drawdown by August 31. ”As a contiguous neighbour and strategic partner, India has a steadfast policy to support a sovereign, democratic and peaceful Afghanistan, where the interests of all sections of the Afghan society, including women, children and minorities, are protected,” Muraleedharan said. ”India supports all peace initiatives leading towards a lasting political settlement through an inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled process, which would lead to peace and stability in the region,” he added. Muraleedharan also referred to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's online participation in the inaugural session of the intra-Afghan negotiations in Doha in September last year. ”The external affairs minister participated in the inaugural session of the intra-Afghan negotiations in Doha held in September 2020. The government is in touch with various stakeholders within and outside Afghanistan, including regional and international partners,” he said. On September 12 last year, an Indian delegation attended the inaugural ceremony of the intra-Afghan negotiations featuring various stakeholders, including the Afghan government and the Taliban, in Doha. Jaishankar joined it through a video-conference. Bagchi said India and the world want to see an independent, sovereign, democratic and stable Afghanistan, at peace with itself and its neighbours.     ”Unilateral imposition of will by any party will not be democratic, cannot lead to stability and cannot provide legitimacy. Gains over the last two decades should be preserved,” he said. The evolving situation in Afghanistan figured prominently in the talks between Jaishankar and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken here on Wednesday. Blinken said there can be no military solution to the Afghan conflict and India has and will continue to make vital contributions to Afghanistan's stability and development as a leader and a critical American partner in the region. The US Secretary of State said both India and the US “largely” see the Afghan conflict in the same light, warning that an Afghanistan that does not respect the rights of its people and commits atrocities against them would become a “pariah state”. India has been a major stakeholder in the peace and stability of Afghanistan. It has already invested nearly USD 3 billion in aid and reconstruction activities in the country. India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process that is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled. It has also been calling upon all sections of the political spectrum in Afghanistan to work together to meet the aspirations of the people of the country, including those from the minority community, for a prosperous and safe future.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-378

Meanwhile, researchers said that due to Kerala's steady R-factor growth, the state will remain in the top spot for the next couple of weeks vis-a-vis new infections. The R-factor indicates the speed at which the viral infection is spreading in the country and an analysis by researchers at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Chennai suggests Kerala has more worries in store. The smaller the value of R is, the faster the disease is on the decline. Conversely, if R is greater than 1, the number of infected people is increasing in each round-- technically, this is what is called the epidemic phase. The bigger the number is than one, the faster the rate of spreading of the disease and Kerala has the highest number of active cases and continues to have an R-value around 1.11. "So looks like it (Kerala) will remain in the top spot for the next couple of weeks. The Northeast continues to have a very bad situation with most states having R-value more than 1," said Sitabhra Sinha of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, who is leading the team. Kerala on Thursday logged 22,064 new covid-19 cases and 128 deaths, taking the caseload to 33,49,365 and the death toll to 16,585. It reported 22,129 cases on Tuesday and 22,056 on Wednesday. State Health minister Veena George on Thursday said 1,63,098 samples were tested in the last 24 hours and the test positivity rate was 13.53 per cent. George said 16,649 people recuperated from the disease on Thursday, taking the number of those cured to 31,77,453. Currently, there are 1,54,820 people under treatment and 4,54,080 under observation of which 27,480 are in isolation wards of various hospitals. There are 323 local self government bodies in the state with a TPR above 15 per cent, an official release said. As its infection rate picks up pace, the Union Health Ministry announced deputing a six-member team to Kerala for effective covid-19 management. The team headed by National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Director S K Singh will reach Kerala on Friday and visit some districts reporting a high case positivity rate, the Health Ministry said in a statement. In a tweet, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said, "the Central government is sending six-member team to Kerala headed by NCDC Director. As a large number of COVID cases are still being reported in Kerala, the team will aid state's ongoing efforts in COVID-19 management." The ministry's statement said the team will work closely with Kerala health authorities, take stock of the ground situation and recommend necessary public health interventions to contain the spread of the virus.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-378

Deputy Commissioner Neeraj Kumar has sought helicopter support from the state government for their evacuation, a district spokesperson said. State Disaster Management Director Sudesh Kumar Mokhta said sorties with a state government helicopter have been planned for Friday due to weather conditions. He said among the 175 stranded in Udaipur's Pattan Valley are 60 women and 16 children. Their evacuation through road seems difficult as the route via Pangi is not expected to be ready by Friday evening, he said. Several roads and bridges have been damaged in the district due to bad weather. In an SMS to PTI, a tourist from Punjab's Hoshiarpur, Ravindra Sood, said, "More than 100 tourists have been stranded in Trilokinat and 35 in Fudan villages due to recent cloudburst in Jhalman, Shansha and Thirot areas in Lauhal Valley." Sood said the number of people stranded at Jhalwan and Udaipur villages is yet to be known and the road was damaged at several places between Kirting and Thirot. Earlier Sood told PTI that the telephone network was not working properly. When contacted, Lahaul-Spiti Deputy Commissioner Neeraj Kumar said those stranded have taken shelter at a temple and are getting adequate food. According to the list provided by the DC, 72 people are stuck at Trilokinat. Of them, 57 are from Kullu, seven each from Punjab and Mandi and one from Ladakh. Of the seven from Punjab, five are from Hoshiarpur and two from Sangrur, he added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-378
29-07-2021||India||Photojournalist Danish Siddiqui was executed by Taliban: Report||Pulitzer Prize-winning Indian photojournalist Danish Siddiqui was not simply killed in a crossfire in Afghanistan, nor was he simply collateral damage, but was "brutally murdered" by the Taliban after verifying his identity, according to a report published in a US-based magazine on Thursday. Siddiqui, 38, was on assignment in Afghanistan when he died. The award-winning journalist was killed while covering clashes between Afghan troops and the Taliban in Spin Boldak district of Kandahar city. According to the Washington Examiner report, Siddiqui travelled with an Afghan National Army team to the Spin Boldak region to cover fighting between Afghan forces and the Taliban to control the lucrative border crossing with Pakistan. When they got to within one-third of a mile of the customs post, a Taliban attack split the team, with the commander and a few men separated from Siddiqui, who remained with three other Afghan troops. During this assault, shrapnel hit Siddiqui, and so he and his team went to a local mosque where he received first aid. As word spread, however, that a journalist was in the mosque, the Taliban attacked. The local investigation suggests the Taliban attacked the mosque only because of Siddiqui's presence there, the report said. Siddiqui was alive when the Taliban captured him. The Taliban verified Siddiqui's identity and then executed him, as well as those with him. The commander and the remainder of his team died as they tried to rescue him, it said. While a widely circulated public photograph shows Siddiqui's face recognizable, I reviewed other photographs and a video of Siddiqui's body provided to me by a source in the Indian government that show the Taliban beat Siddiqui around the head and then riddled his body with bullets, wrote the writer Micheal Rubin, who is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. The Taliban's decision to hunt down, execute Siddiqui, and then mutilate his corpse shows that they do not respect the rules of war or conventions that govern the behaviour of the global community., the report said. Siddiqui won the Pulitzer Prize in 2018 as part of the Reuters team for their coverage of the Rohingya crisis. He had extensively covered the Afghanistan conflict, the Hong Kong protests and other major events in Asia, Middle East, and Europe. Siddiqui was laid to rest at the Jamia Millia Islamia graveyard where a sea of mourners gathered to pay their last respects. His body arrived at the Delhi airport in the evening of July 18 and was later brought to his residence in Jamia Nagar where a huge crowd, including his family and friends, had gathered.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-378

He said this kind of action was necessary to rein in the lawmakers, who disrupt proceedings and waste the country's time and money. "The Union government is ready to discuss various issues in Parliament, but the opposition has been creating ruckus in the House for the last three days," he said in a statement issued here in the evening. These members even left their seats and rushed to the Well and wasted precious time and money of the country. The Union government should formulate a new law with a provision to suspend a ruckus-creating parliamentarian for two years, the Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment said. This law should be applicable to the ruling party's lawmakers as well, he said. "It is wrong to disrupt the proceedings of the House for such a long time," he added. Both the Houses of Parliament have been witnessing repeated adjournments during the ongoing Monsoon session due to continuous protests by the opposition members over various issues, including the Pegasus snooping controversy, farm laws and price rise. On the Pegasus row, Athawale said the Modi government had won a clear mandate and hence it does not need to snoop on anyone. "There is no need to tap phone calls either. The allegations related to Pegasus spyware and its alleged links with the Centre are baseless, he said. On West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's visit to Delhi to initiate talks with opposition parties to stitch together a united front against the ruling BJP, Athawale said, "I am not sure how many political leaders will stand behind Mamata Banerjee against BJP-led NDA in 2024 general election. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lead the coalition again and come to power." About setting up a permanent base camp of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) in flood-hit Raigad district of Maharashtra, he said if the state sends a proposal about it to the central government, he would personally follow it up with Union Home Minister Amit Shah.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-378

29-07-2021||India||Goa CM draws flak for insensitive comment on rape victims||Under pressure from the opposition over the gang rape of two girls, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has drawn flak over his statement in the Assembly that the parents should "introspect" why their children were out on a beach late at night. One of the accused who is a government employee has been suspended, the chief minister informed the House on Thursday. Four men, one of them a driver with the agriculture department, allegedly posed as policemen and raped two girls after beating up the boys who were with them on Benaulim beach on Sunday. All the accused have been arrested. But Sawant's statements in the Assembly on Wednesday where he appeared to blame the parents led to angry reactions. When 14-year-olds stay on the beach the whole night, the parents need to introspect. Just because children don't listen, we cannot put the responsibility on the government and police, he had said during a debate in the House. The chief minister, who also holds the home portfolio, further said that parents have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their children. State Congress spokesperson Altone D'Costa said the law and order situation has deteriorated in Goa. "Why should we fear while moving around at night? Criminals should be in jail and law-abiding citizens should be out freely moving around, he said. Goa Forward Party MLA Vijai Sardesai said the safety of citizens is the responsibility of police and government. "If they can't provide it to us, the CM has no right to sit in the post, he said. It is shocking that @goacm is blaming parents for allowing their children to venture out in the night claiming that it is not safe. if State govt can't assure us our security, who can give it? Goa has a history of being safe state for women, that tag is being lost in @BJP4Goa rule," independent MLA Rohan Khaunte tweeted. Defending the police during the discussion on Wednesday, Sawant had also pointed out that of the 10 youngsters who went to the beach for a party, four -- the teenage victims and two boys -- stayed on the beach the whole night. Teens, particularly minors, should not be spending the nights on beaches," he added. A legislator had claimed that an influential person was trying to protect the accused. Sawant told the House during the zero hour on Thursday that one of the accused who is a government servant has been suspended, and the process to dismiss him was underway. Director General of Police Mukesh Kumar Meena told reporters that patrolling along the beaches and isolated spots has been intensified to prevent such incidents.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-379

A bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana has already sought a response from the Delhi government on creating a portal for providing details about the period of incarceration undergone by inmates in prisons. The bench, also comprising Justice Surya Kant, was not impressed with the argument of the Delhi government that there were concerns of infringement of right to privacy of inmates if the details, such as period of incarceration, are put in public domain. What are the privacy issues? We do not understand. No, no. This must be available to common public also...suppose a person is in jail for last 20 years. Don't you think that you must apprise that person about the right to seek release by taking recourse of parole, furlough..., the bench told Additional Solicitor General Jayant Sud who was appearing for the Delhi government. During the hearing, the law officer said that in Delhi prisons, e-kiosk' have been set up where the inmates themselves can go and check details like the period of incarceration. "Let me call a meeting of concerned authorities and examine this issue for evolving a mechanism to help entitled convicts in seeking remission," the CJI said on Wednesday. The bench, which dismissed the appeal of one Mukesh Kumar filed against an order of July 16, 2007 of the Delhi High Court by which he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in a murder case, however, kept the case pending to deal with the larger issue of providing information on period of incarceration in public domain. It has now posted the matter after four weeks. Earlier, the top court had asked the city government to apprise it of the time frame within which it would create a portal for providing details about the period of incarceration undergone by inmates in prisons. Prior to this, it had asked the Delhi government to inform it about the latest policy on pre-mature release of the convicts.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-379

Guests who have tested positive for COVID-19 and have stable vitals can now isolate within any of the listed 100+ hotels, located in 23 cities across India. The properties have a range of price points and offer additional services as part of the package price and are equipped with amenities like COVID-19 nursing support, three daily meals, oxygen support and other services catering to the guest’s wellbeing, throughout their recovery. Guests will find a contact list of hotels/hospitals (hospi-tels)  on the dedicated link on Agoda’s website and can call and pay directly to the property. Agoda’s second dedicated platform aligns with its alternative quarantine product successfully rolled out in Thailand, Hong Kong, and the Philippines, which allows members of the public who are COVID negative, including public facing front liners, who wish to protect their families and live close to work.  With more than 450+ hotels in cities such as New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata, and towns including Mohali, Raipur, and Nashik to name a few, Indians returning home, travelling between states or self-isolating can now book their stay into a hotel to quarantine for as long as they wish via Agoda. Guests must provide evidence of COVID-19 negative reports at check-in. "We want to make it as easy as possible for Indians looking for somewhere to isolate to be able to do so. We hope to help, by doing what we do best, using our tech to connect our partner hotels with guests, and making hotel bookings quick and stress-free through our platform,” said Tarik Fadil, Associate Vice President, Partner Services, Indian Subcontinent and North Southeast Asia. “Our teams have worked tirelessly over the past few weeks to curate a list of hotels to accommodate COVID positive patients as they fight through the illness and protect their loved ones by isolating. We hope that the comprehensive list of hotels will alleviate some stress for Indians,” continued Tarik. The digital booking platforms for both quarantine packages as well as isolation stays are now live, with more property options expected to join the program in the coming months.

The monsoon, which arrived in Delhi on July 13 making it the most-delayed in 19 years, is now drenching Delhi, flooding low-lying areas and causing long traffic snarls. On Friday, heavy rains caused waterlogging at several places in Delhi, including Civil Lines, Hauz Khas, Moti Bagh and Jor Bagh. Many Delhiites took to Twitter and complained about waterlogging and traffic jams due to the fresh spell of rainfall. "Pouring rain gives respite from sweltering heat but brings Delhi to its knees with waterlogging, crawling traffic, mammoth jam on roads and stuck vehicles & exposes the tall claims of politicians of every hue & colour," tweeted Niraj Kumar Singh.

Modi said in the last one year, teachers, principals and policymakers of the country have worked very hard in implementing the National Education Policy on the ground. Addressing a programme on the completion of one year of the NEP, the prime minister said what new heights "we will achieve in the future will depend on what kind of education we are giving to our youth at present". "India's new National Education Policy is one of the major factors in the 'mahayagna' (great exercise) of nation-building," Modi said. The new NEP assures the youth that the country is now completely with them and with their aspirations, he said. Modi said the Artificial Intelligence (AI) programme which has just been launched will make the youth future-oriented and open the way for an AI-driven economy. Highlighting that the NEP also gives importance to mother tongue and local languages, Modi said he was happy that 14 engineering colleges in eight states are going to start studies in five Indian languages -- Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi and Bangla. Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan as well as some chief ministers also participated in the event. The NEP, which was approved by the Union Cabinet last year at a meeting presided by Prime Minister Modi, replaced the National Policy on Education framed in 1986. It is aimed at paving the way for transformational reforms in school and higher education systems to make India a global knowledge superpower.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-379

In Delhi, theatres were allowed to reopen from Monday at 50 per cent occupancy. To encourage and thank people who got vaccinated during the nationwide vaccination drive, PVR has introduced a Jab Offer' for the customers. As part of the scheme, one vaccinated guest can get another ticket free on select content as well as one F&B Combo free with the purchase of another in the first week of reopening.

The court recorded that the ED was yet to supply a copy of its ECIR to the parties concerned.

This is the third time, since the starting of the second wave of the pandemic in the national capital, that zero fatality has been logged in a day. On July 18 and July 24 too, no death due to COVID-19 was recorded, according to official data, while 51 and 66 cases were reported, respectively. On March 2 this year, the national capital had reported zero death due to the virus. On that day, the number of single-day infections stood at 217 and the positivity rate was 0.33 per cent. The second wave swept the city during April-May period. On Thursday, the city registered 51 cases and zero fatality, while the positivity rate stood at 0.08 per cent, according to the latest bulletin. The death toll in the city on Wednesday had stood at 25,049. On Wednesday, the city had registered 67 cases and three fatalities, while the positivity rate was 0.09 per cent. The infection rate which had reached to 36 per cent in the last week of April, has come down to 0.08 per cent now. On February 16, ninety-four people were diagnosed Covid positive while the daily tally was 96 on January 27, according to official figures. Despite fall in daily cases in the last several days, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had recently cautioned that the chances of the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic were quite real, while he asserted that his government was preparing on a "war-footing" to combat it. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) recently had passed a colour-coded response action plan under which curbs will be implemented in accordance with the severity of the COVID-19 situation here to deal with a possible third wave of the pandemic. Delhi had been reeling under a brutal second wave of the pandemic that is sweeping the country, claiming a massive number of lives daily, with the recent oxygen supply shortage issue at various hospitals, adding to the woes. Since April 19, both daily cases and single-day deaths count had been spiralling up, with over 28,000 cases and 277 deaths recorded on April 20; rising to 306 fatalities on April 22. On May 3, the city registered a record 448 deaths, as per the official data. However, the number of cases have shown a downward trend and the positivity rate too has been shrinking in the last several days. The number of deaths per day, has also been showing a decline in the last couple of days. On May 15, Kejriwal had said, "The virus is reducing in Delhi slowly and steadily, and I hope it diminishes completely and does not rise again. However, we are not going to become negligent in anyway", while sounding a tone of caution. Meanwhile, the DDMA last week announced further lifting of restrictions, in view of the improved coronavirus situation. Following the relaxations in norms, the Delhi Metro is running with full seating capacity from July 26, with still no provision for standing travel for commuters. A total of 67,368 tests, including 46,425 RT-PCR tests and 20,943 rapid antigen tests, were conducted a day ago, according to the health bulletin on Thursday. The number of cumulative cases on Thursday stood at 14,36,144. Over 14.1 lakh patients have recovered from the virus. The number of active cases decreased to 554 on Thursday from 573 a day before, the bulletin said.

29-07-2021||India||US: Bill introduced to end programme allowing foreign students to stay after studies||A group of US lawmakers has reintroduced a legislation in the House of Representatives to eliminate a programme that allows foreign students to stay in the country for work after the completion of their studies under certain conditions, a bill if passed into law can affect tens and thousands of Indians studying in this country. Congressman Paul A Gosar along with Congressman Mo Brooks, Andy Biggs and Matt Gaetz introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Americans Act, a legislation that would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act on the Optional Practice Training (OPT). What country creates a programme, but not a law, that rewards its businesses to fire citizen workers and replace them with foreign labour to pay the foreign labour less? The United States. The programme is called OPT and it reflects a complete abandonment of our own workers, Gosar said. He first introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Americans Act in the 116th Congress and has twice signed amicus briefs in support of American workers in a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security to eliminate the OPT. The OPT is a guest worker programme administered by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). There are about 80,000 Indian students in the US on OPT. The bill has to pass through the Senate before it can be sent to the President to sign into law. However, passing the bill through Senate is not that easy given that the Democrats are in majority in both the Chambers of the US Congress. Gosar alleges that the OPT circumvents the H-1B cap by allowing over 100,000 aliens admitted as foreign students to work for up to three years in the US after graduation. These foreign workers are exempt from payroll taxes, making them at least 10-15 per cent cheaper than a comparable American worker, he argued. Landing that first job out of college will only become more difficult for young Americans as our universities formalise the role they play in crowding out opportunities once reserved for American graduates. For this reason, the OPT must be eliminated, stated Kevin Lynn, Founder of US Techworkers. The OPT openly undercuts American workers, particularly higher-skilled workers and recent college graduates, by giving employers an actual tax incentive to hire compliant, inexpensive foreign labour under the guise of "student training, said Rosemary Jenks, Director of Government Relations, Numbers USA.

The former Union Minister also warned that such a front will not take off if parties debate on which leader or political outfit should lead it at this stage itself. "They (opposition parties) should not bother about leadership now," Moily told. "If they start debating as to who should become its leader, which political party should lead, it will not take off," the former Karnataka Chief Minister said. He welcomed West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's meeting with the Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in the national capital on Wednesday, and her comments on the need for opposition parties to work together. On perception in some quarters that only an anti-Modi sentiment is bringing opposition outfits together, Moily said: "That alone should not be projected. Anti-individualism will not take take any political front forward." "That's what they (the then opposition parties) used to do -- anti-Indira Gandhi. That did not succeed," he said. Moily said the opposition agenda should not be based on personal issues. "It should be based upon ideological issues." He spoke out against adopting a policy of "opposition-for-opposition-sake" and a "negative approach". "Opposition parties should unite and come to a basic understanding.It should be principled opposition.They should draw up a common minimum programme as a result of unity.Otherwise, people will not trust us," Moily said. Without a common minimum programme, an opposition front will not take off, according to him. "The national debate should be on sustenance of democracy, secularism, and taking the country forward and also against the 'negative agenda' of the present government," Moily said. He said no party in the opposition front should oppose entry of any outfit wanting to come onboard.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-380
29-07-2021||India||Delhi Assembly passes resolution against Asthana’s appointment, terms it 'unconstitutional'||The ruling AAP on Thursday slammed the Centre over the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as the Commissioner of Delhi Police, alleging the move was aimed at "harassing" the party leaders. Raising the issue in a short duration discussion on the first day of the Monsoon session of the Delhi Assembly, AAP MLA Sanjiv Jha moved a resolution terming Asthana's appointment as "unconstitutional" and against Supreme Court directions. The resolution expressed "disapproval" against the controversial Gujarat-cadre officer being "forced upon Delhi" as its police commissioner. The Union government had on Tuesday appointed Asthana as the Delhi Police commissioner, giving him a one-year extension on the new post days before his retirement. Asthana, a 1984-batch IPS officer, was serving as the director-general of the Border Security Force and was due to retire on July 31. Jha also questioned Asthana's knowledge of Delhi and policing in the city as he was a Gujarat-cadre officer. Participating in the debate, AAP MLAs Gulab Singh, Akhilesh Pati Tripathi, Somnath Bharti and B S Joon, supported Jha's resolution and alleged that Asthana was brought to Delhi to "muzzle and harass the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) . Tripathi asserted that AAP leaders and workers were not scared by Asthana's appointment and added, "We are born out of revolution. We are not like the Congressmen in Gujarat." AAP MLA Bharti questioned the purpose behind Asthana's appointment, alleging that he has been brought to harass AAP MLAs, councilors and the chief minister". Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri called Asthana an "honest and decorated" IPS officer who was awarded the President's Police Medal twice. "Rakesh Asthana successfully investigated the Godhara carnage and Purulia arms drop cases. He also investigated the land scam related to the son-in-law of a political party chief. The House should welcome his appointment," he said. In his reply over the debate in the House, Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain dared Bidhuri for action against the "son-in-law" he was not naming and added that the BJP and Congress are "two sides of the same coin". He supported the resolution, saying the central government should not have defied the Supreme Court directions while making the appointment. The resolution was accepted by the House with a voice vote.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-380
29-07-2021||India||Govt announces 27% reservation for OBCs in medical, dental courses||The government on Thursday announced a 27-per cent quota for OBCs and 10 per cent reservation for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category in the All-India Quota (AIQ) scheme for undergraduate and postgraduate medical and dental courses from the current academic year, 2021-22. Hailing the "landmark decision" taken by his government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted: "This will immensely help thousands of our youth every year get better opportunities and create a new paradigm of social justice in our country." Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya also lauded the "historic decision". "A historic decision has been taken by the government in the field of medical education in the country. Under All India Quota, 27 per cent reservation will be given to OBC students and 10 per cent to weaker income group (EWS) students in undergraduate/post graduate, medical and dental education," he said in a tweet. The Prime Minister, at a meeting held on Monday, had directed the Union ministries concerned to facilitate an effective solution to this long-pending issue, a statement issued by the health ministry said. "This decision would benefit nearly 1,500 OBC students in MBBS and 2,500 OBC students in postgraduation and also around 550 EWS students in MBBS and around 1,000 EWS students in postgraduation," it added. "The present government is committed to providing due reservation both to the backward category as well as the EWS category. The Union government has now taken a historic decision to provide for 27 per cent reservation for OBCs and 10 per cent reservation for EWS in the AIQ scheme," the ministry stated. OBC students from across the country shall now be able to take the benefit of this reservation in the AIQ scheme to compete for seats in any state. Being a central scheme, the Central List of OBCs shall be used for the purpose. The AIQ scheme was introduced in 1986 under the Supreme Court's directions to provide for domicile-free merit-based opportunities to students from any state aspiring to study in a good medical college in another state. The all-India quota consists of 15 per cent of the total available UG seats and 50 per cent of the total available PG seats in government medical colleges. Initially, there was no reservation in the AIQ scheme up to 2007. In 2007, the Supreme Court introduced 15 per cent reservation for the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and a 7.5-per cent quota for the Scheduled Tribes (STs) in the scheme. When the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act became effective in 2007, providing for a uniform 27 per cent reservation to the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), the same was implemented in all the central educational institutions such as the Safdarjung Hospital, the Lady Hardinge Medical College, the Aligarh Muslim University and the Banaras Hindu University. However, it was not extended to the AIQ seats of the state medical and dental colleges. In order to provide benefits to students belonging to the EWS category in admission to higher educational institutions, a constitutional amendment was made in 2019, which enabled the provision of 10 per cent reservation for the category, the statement said. Accordingly, the number of seats in the medical and dental colleges was increased over the next two years (2019-20 and 2020-21) to accommodate this additional 10 per cent EWS reservation so that the total number of seats available for the unreserved category does not reduce. In the AIQ seats, however, this benefit was not extended so far, the statement said. "Therefore, along with the 27 per cent reservation for OBCs, 10 per cent reservation for EWS is also being extended in AIQ seats for all the undergraduate/postgraduate medical/dental courses from the current academic year 2021-22. "The above decision is the reflection of the government's commitment to provide due reservation for backward and EWS category students," it added. The decision is also in sync with the significant reforms carried out in the field of medical education since 2014, the statement underlined. Over the last six years, the number of MBBS seats in the country has increased by 56 per cent from 54,348 in 2014 to 84,649 in 2020 and that of PG seats has gone up by 80 per cent from 30,191 in 2014 to 54,275 in 2020. In the same period, 179 new medical colleges have been established and the country currently has 558 (289 government and 269 private) medical colleges.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-380

Mahesh Tapase, chief spokesperson of the NCP, which is a constituent in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, made the allegation in a statement. "The Union agriculture minister has announced a relief package of Rs 701 crore, but it is for the flood-affected people (in Maharashtra) in 2020. It means, the Centre has given the relief amount almost a year later. However, the BJP is misleading the people that the aid is for the people who were affected by the last week's floods," he said. It means that of the entire relief amount of Rs 3,701 crore, the Union government has sanctioned Rs 701 crore only. There is no assistance announced by it for the people who are affected now, he said. The NCP leader said that the assessment of damage was underway and the state government would finalise its report as soon as possible. Ratnagiri, Raigad districts in the coastal Konkan region and Kolhapur and Satara districts in western Maharashtra were the worst-affected parts in the state due to the floods and heavy rains that triggered landslides at multiple locations.

29-07-2021||India||India in touch with stakeholders to support peaceful Afghanistan, says Centre||India on Thursday said it has a steadfast policy to support a sovereign, democratic and peaceful Afghanistan and it is in touch with various stakeholders within and outside Afghanistan including regional and international partners. The comments by the Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan in Rajya Sabha came a day after India and the US strongly pitched for an immediate intra-Afghan peace process to end the violence in Afghanistan and find a political settlement. Muraleedharan said India supports all peace initiatives leading towards a lasting political settlement through an inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled process. The Taliban has been making rapid advances across Afghanistan by resorting to widespread violence since the US began withdrawing its troops on May 1. The US has already pulled back the majority of its forces and is looking to complete the drawdown by August 31. "As a contiguous neighbour and strategic partner, India has a steadfast policy to support sovereign, democratic and peaceful Afghanistan, where the interest of all sections of Afghan society including women, children and minorities are protected," he said. "India supports all peace initiatives leading towards a lasting political settlement through an inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan controlled process which would lead to peace and stability in the region," the minister said. He also referred to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's online participation in September last year in the inaugural session of the intra-Afghan negotiations in Doha "The external affairs minister participated in the inaugural session of the intra-Afghan negotiations in Doha held in September 2020. The government is in touch with various stakeholders within and outside Afghanistan, including regional and international partners," Muraleedharan said. On September 12, an Indian delegation attended the inaugural ceremony of the intra-Afghan negotiations featuring various stakeholders including the Afghan government and the Taliban in Doha. Jaishankar joined it through video conference. The evolving situation in Afghanistan figured prominently during talks bewteen Jaishankar and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken here on Wednesday. Blinken said there can be no military solution to the Afghan conflict and India has and will continue to make vital contributions to Afghanistan's stability and development as a leader and a critical American partner in the region. The US Secretary of State said that both India and the US "largely" see Afghan conflict in the same light, warning that an Afghanistan that does not respect the rights of its people and commits atrocities against them would become a "pariah state". India has been a major stakeholder in the peace and stability of Afghanistan. It has already invested nearly USD 3 billion in aid and reconstruction activities in the country.

"I want to draw attention of all members of this House. This is my 13th year as an MP and the way I was called 'Bihari Gunda' at the Parliamentary committee meeting yesterday by a woman, by Trinamool Congress, I have not seen this in my life," Dubey said, amid din in the House due to protests by opposition over Pegasus and farm bill issues. "What is our mistake? Our mistake is in developing this country. We have worked as labourers, as Hindi-speaking people whether from Uttar Pradesh or Madhya Pradesh... we have worked hard. We have learnt sessions from Lord Ram," Dubey said. However, Dubey did not name the TMC member. As Dubey was speaking, Rajendra Agrawal, who was chairing the proceedings, adjourned the House till 12:30 pm. As the House reassembled at 12:30 pm, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal urged the Chair to allow Dubey to complete the issue he was raising before the House got adjourned. However, Agrawal called for papers to be laid on the table. As opposition slogan shouting continued, Agrawal adjourned the proceedings till 2 pm. The meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information and Technology, chaired by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, on Wednesday was set to question government officials on the Pegasus spyware issue. However, the meeting was postponed due to lack of quorum. Even though the meeting did not take place, the gathering of BJP and opposition party members witnessed drama. Dubey had alleged that Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra called him a 'Bihari Gunda'. Dubey, in a tweet on Wednesday tagged TMC supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and alleged that Moitra's comments show her party's attitude towards the people of Bihar and the Hindi-speaking parts of the country. Moitra denied the charge, saying Dubey was not even present for the meeting.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-381

Justice Jayant Nath allowed the withdrawal of the plea after a statement made by Chawla's counsel, advocate Deepak Khosla. Learned counsel for the plaintiff (Chawla) wants to withdraw the application with liberty to avail remedy before the appellate court. Application is dismissed as withdrawn, the court said. Chawla had moved the application seeking that her lawsuit against 5G rollout be declared rejected instead of dismissed . Chawla's counsel argued that the plaint, which never went up to the level of suit, could only be rejected or returned in terms of the Civil Procedure Code, and not dismissed. The court had then also granted a week's time for deposit of Rs 20 lakh costs after Chawla decided to not press the application for its waiver. Application for refund of court fees was also withdrawn by Chawla. In June, the court had described the lawsuit by Chawla and two others against 5G roll out as "defective", "abuse of process of law" and filed for "gaining publicity" and dismissed it with costs of Rs 20 lakh. Justice J R Midha said the plaint in which questions have been raised about health hazards due to the 5G technology was "not maintainable" and was "stuffed with unnecessary Scandalous, frivolous and vexatious averments" which are liable to be struck down. The court said the suit filed by actress-environmentalist and others was to gain publicity which was clear as Chawla circulated the video conferencing link of the hearing on her social media account which resulted in the repeated disruptions thrice by unknown miscreants who continued disruptions despite repeated warnings.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-381
29-07-2021||India||Delhi Assembly suspends BJP MLA over derogatory remarks||Delhi Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel suspended BJP MLA Om Prakash Sharma from the House for the day for making derogatory remarks against AAP MLAs on the first day of the monsoon session on Thursday. The speaker also marshalled out Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators Vijender Gupta and Anil Bajpai for defying his directives and not letting the House function. Goel expressed his anguish and "deep pain" over depriving the house committees of their powers by the Centre. He gave a ruling that two hours of sitting of the House will be devoted to the Question Hour and special mentions under Rule 280. He stipulated that the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs will get 160 minutes while the opposition BJP legislators will be allowed 20 minutes to speak. "I will not allow the Opposition MLAs to speak for even one second extra than 20 minutes as per the House rules," he said while lamenting that the BJP legislators did not oppose divesting the house committees of their powers. As soon as the proceedings of the first day of the Assembly's monsoon session began, the BJP MLAs demanded to be heard during the Question Hour. They trooped into the well of the House and started shouting. Following this, some whip MLAs of the ruling AAP also entered the well, creating a pandemonium-like situation. The speaker asked the members to return to their seats and "let the House function" but the BJP MLAs did not relent. The speaker then asked the marshals to escort Gupta and Bajpai out of the House. In the melee, BJP's Sharma allegedly made derogatory remarks against some AAP MLAs and asked them to "remain in their limits". Taking cognizance of this, Goel asked Sharma to tender an apology. As the BJP legislator refused to oblige, he was suspended for the day. "Your remarks 'remain in the limits' to other members of the House are objectionable and since you did not apologise, I suspend Om Prakash Sharma for the entire day from the House," the speaker said while issuing the ruling. The BJP has eight MLAs in the 70-member Assembly dominated by the ruling AAP that has 62 members in the House. According to the list of business for the House on Thursday, AAP's Sanjiv Jha will initiate a short-duration discussion on the "appointment of the Delhi police commissioner in violation of Supreme Court directions". AAP MLA Bhavna Gaur will table a motion for conferring Bharat Ratna on late environmentalist Sunderlal Bahuguna, a demand earlier raised by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-381
29-07-2021||India||Water levels in Yamuna rise after heavy rains in catchment areas of Delhi||The water level in the Yamuna in Delhi on Thursday rose to 203.37 metres, close to the warning mark of 204.50 metres after heavy rains in the upper catchment areas of the river, officials said. The administration had sounded an alert in the low-lying areas close to the river floodplains on Tuesday and the situation is being monitored round the clock, they said. "The water level was recorded at 203.37 metres at the Old Railway Bridge at 10:30 am," an official of the Irrigation and Flood Control Department said. The Yamuna has swollen because of rains in Delhi and the upper catchment areas, he said, adding that more water is being released from the Hathnikund barrage into the river in Haryana's Yamunanagar district. "The flow rate peaked to 1.60 lakh cusecs in the last 24 hours, the highest so far this year," the official said. The water discharged from the barrage normally takes two-three days to reach the capital. Water was being released into the Yamuna at the rate of 85,879 cusecs at 10 am on Thursday. Normally, the flow rate at the Hathnikund barrage is 352 cusec, but the discharge is increased after heavy rainfall in the catchment areas. One cusec is equivalent to 28.32 litres per second. The water level may rise further as there is a prediction of rains in the catchment areas, the official said. In 2019, the flow rate had peaked at 8.28 lakh cusecs on August 18 and 19, and the water level in the Yamuna had touched 206.60 metres, breaching the danger mark of 205.33 metres. The Delhi government had to launch evacuation and relief operations after the overflowing river submerged many low-lying areas. In 2013, the river had swelled to 207.32 metres. In 1978, the water level in the Yamuna rose to a record 207.49 metres.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-381

The viral video was shared by the official Twitter handle of the Gujarat Information Department on Wednesday. "Over 3,000 blackbucks were seen crossing the road at Bhavnagar's Blackbuck National Park," the department tweeted. PM Modi commented "Excellent" on the one-minute video shared by the Information Department. Blackbucks are protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act. According to the national park's range forest officer Ankur Patel, blackbucks keep moving from one place to another, and the video was shot a few days back by a Gram Rakshak Dal (GRD) jawan stationed at a police check post on Dholera-Bhavnagar highway. The road seen in the video connects the highway to Velavadar village and the National Park, Patel said. "The land seen on both sides of that internal road belongs to the forest department. While going back home after his night duty, the GRD jawan saw the blackbucks crossing the road in the morning and captured the amazing sight on his mobile phone and shared it on social media," the official said. The Blackbuck National Park remains shut for tourists from June 15 to October 16, he said. As per a rough estimate, there are around 3,000 blackbucks in the national park and 4,000 in the reserve forest areas and wastelands nearby, the official said. "In the viral video, 700 to 800 blackbucks could be seen. Since majority of them were females or sub-adults, their colour was brown. Only adult males are black" he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-381

According to a statement issued by the National Health Surveillance Agency of Brazil, Anvisa its Collegiate Board on Tuesday took a decision to suspend the exceptional and temporary authorisation for import and distribution of Covaxin after Bharat Biotech informed the South America government about the termination of its pact with its Brazilian partners. "The Collegiate Board of Anvisaunanimously decided, on Tuesday (27/7), to provisionally suspend the exceptional and temporary authorisation for import and distribution of the vaccine against Covid-19-Covaxin, requested by the Ministry of Health," Anvisa said in statement posted on its website. Bharat Biotech on July 23 said it terminated the MoU it entered with Precisa Medicamentos and Envixia Pharmaceuticals LLC for its Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin for the Brazilian market. The termination of the MoU came after the deal with the Brazilian government for the supply of 20 million doses of Covaxin landed in controversy and attracted investigation by authorities in that country. "The measure prevails until there is new information that allows us to conclude that the legal and technical security of maintaining the decision that authorised the importation is maintained," Anvisa further said in a roughly translated version of Portuguese of the statement. Though the exceptional and temporary importation of the vaccine had been authorized on June 4, at the ninth Extraordinary Meeting of the Collegiate Board of Anvisa, Brazil never imported the jab. Bharat Biotech will continue to work diligently with Anvisa, to complete the regulatory approval process for Covaxin, Bharat Biotech had said while announcing the termination of its pact with its Brazilian partners.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-381
29-07-2021||India||Centre not allowing open discussions on issues of national importance at Parliament, says Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday asked the government not to waste more time of Parliament and let the Opposition raise issues of inflation, farmers and Pegasus in the House. He also said that the foundation of India's democracy is that Parliamentarians should be the voice of the people and discuss issues of national importance, but the Modi government is not allowing this to happen. The Opposition has been demanding a discussion on the Pegasus snooping issue and the repeal of the new farm laws in Parliament. "The foundation of our democracy is that Parliamentarians should be the voice of the people and should discuss issues of national importance. The Modi government is not allowing the Opposition to do this work. Don't waste more time of the Parliament, let them talk about inflation, farmers and Pegasus," Gandhi said on Twitter. There continues to be a deadlock in Parliament over the Pegasus snooping issue with the opposition demanding a discussion and a Supreme Court-monitored probe into it while the government is saying it has not done any snooping. Opposition members have been giving adjournment notices in both houses of Parliament to allow the Pegasus issue to be discussed, which have been rejected by the chair. Congress and other Opposition leaders have given such notices on Thursday also. An international media consortium has reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on a list of potential targets for surveillance using Israeli firm NSO's Pegasus spyware.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-381

29-07-2021||India||Pegasus: 14 parties vow to fight the spyware battle together||As many as 14 parties stood shoulder to shoulder on Wednesday and vowed to fight the Pegasus battle together, less than 24 hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to drive a wedge in the Opposition by singling out the Congress as the disruptor of parliamentary proceedings. The monsoon rain in the capital provided a political metaphor with Opposition leaders sharing umbrella space as they marched around 2km from Parliament to Vijay Chowk. “The entire Opposition is standing here today because our voice is suppressed inside Parliament,” Congress MP Rahul Gandhi said, addressing the media with the leaders of 13 other parties. Trinamul Congress members were absent, but the party is with the rest of the Opposition on the Pegasus controversy. “We are asking one question: Has the government purchased Pegasus, yes or no? Did the government use Pegasus on our own people, yes or no? We are clearly told that no discussion will be allowed on Pegasus,” Rahul added. The others present said the Opposition would fight the battle together. In recent memory, so many Opposition voices have not spoken from under the same umbrella — so to speak — in the capital, certainly not the day after the Prime Minister himself had tried to divide them. On Tuesday, Modi had told the BJP MPs to “expose the Congress before the people and the media”, saying it was not allowing Parliament to function. The Prime Minister had glossed over the fact that other Opposition parties like the DMK, Trinamul Congress and the Left were also protesting and stalling Parliament. At Vijay Chowk on Wednesday, the Samajwadi Party’s Ram Gopal Verma responded to Modi’s charge. “There can’t be a bigger lie than the government’s claim that the Opposition doesn’t want Parliament to function,” Verma said. “We are demanding a discussion, giving notices every day, but the government says, ‘No discussion on Pegasus’. The Pegasus snooping can steal our military secrets. We must have a structured debate,” he added. The Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut said: “As Rahulji said, they have attacked our democracy. It’s a betrayal, it’s back-stabbing as they did it on the sly. This is a national security issue and if this will not be discussed in Parliament, what else (would be)?” NCP lawmaker Supriya Sule alleged that the government had snooped on the wives and children of ministers. The CPI’s Binoy Viswam compared the alleged surveillance regime to Hitler’s Germany. The Rashtriya Janata Dal’s Manoj Jha wondered how the government could brush aside the opinion of parties that represented 60 per cent of the population. He said the people would find a way out if the government failed to act democratically. DMK leader T.R. Balu too countered the government allegation that the Opposition didn’t want any discussion, saying the treasury benches wanted to use Parliament only for their own business. It is too early to say whether the consensus on the Pegasus controversy would become the launch pad for a more durable understanding in the months to come. But the parallel with the Bofors-era Opposition mood -– when concerted action that germinated in Parliament had flowered into a wider backlash against the then government -– was hard to miss. Rahul said the government’s refusal to allow a parliamentary discussion on the Pegasus controversy suggested it had done something “dangerous for the country”. “Narendra Modi and (home minister) Amit Shah have hit the soul of India’s democracy. They are not allowing a discussion in Parliament because it is obvious the government has done something wrong, something which is dangerous for the country,” the former Congress president said. “Otherwise, they would have said, ‘Come, let’s have the discussion’.” The Opposition leaders were talking to the media after a concerted move by all the Opposition parties in Parliament had failed to get the government to agree to a discussion on the controversy. The Pegasus Project media exposé suggests that the phone numbers of many politicians, judges, rights activists, journalists and other Indians were earmarked for potential hacking and some were indeed hacked through the Israeli spyware Pegasus, which is sold only to governments. Rahul said: “I want to ask the youth of India --- Modi has inserted a weapon in your phone. That weapon was used against me, against other leaders, against the Supreme Court, activists, media. Why should this issue not be allowed to be discussed in Parliament? “This weapon was used against India. This weapon should have been used against terrorists and anti-national forces. We are asking Modi-Shah, why did they use this weapon against India’s democratic institutions? Why did they attack India’s democracy?” Rahul went on: “We are being accused of disrupting Parliament. We are only doing our duty. If we agree to take up other issues, the Pegasus issue will be over. “For us, Pegasus is related to nationalism. What has been done is treason. Modi and Shah have committed an anti-national act.... This is not merely a privacy issue. We want a discussion which should be replied to by either the Prime Minister or the home minister, and (we want) a Supreme Court-monitored inquiry.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-382
29-07-2021||India||Mamata hopes for a stronger political opposition for 2024 polls||The BJP may appear to be very healthy but the Opposition parties will be politically stronger and the next general election will be one of hope, Mamata Banerjee said on Wednesday, an hour before she met Sonia Gandhi at her 10 Janpath residence with the objective of strengthening the Opposition alliance. “The BJP may look very healthy, but from the political angle, the Opposition will be stronger this time…. We hope that the 2024 elections will be Hope 24,” the Bengal chief minister told reporters in New Delhi in the afternoon. Since landing in Delhi on Monday, Mamata has been advocating a united fight against the BJP. At the media interaction and then during a brief reaction after meeting Sonia, she explained her mission. Hope 24 achievable: The central theme of Mamata’s argument has been the changing mood in the country over the past couple of years. She took care to explain how rising prices, the Covid mismanagement and the Pegasus intrusion have worked against the BJP. Mamata said: “A lot of people who used to support them don’t anymore.” “We have seen a lot of ‘achchhe din (good days)’, now we want to see ‘sachche din (days of truth)’…. Have faith in the people of this country,” she added. While she stressed that a united Opposition was needed to capitalise on this mood, she had to face a volley of questions around the nuts and bolts of an Opposition alliance. As Mamata had made a similar attempt before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls by bringing together representatives of 23 Opposition parties at a rally in Calcutta, questions on the failed experiment also flew thick and fast during the 75-minute interaction. “Things have changed since then…. You know what was Narendra Modi’s popularity in 2019 and if you do a survey now, you will get to know what’s the situation now,” she said in an attempt to underscore that “Hope 24” is an achievable target. In order to buttress her argument that the BJP can be defeated, she referred to Trinamul’s victory over the BJP in the recently held Bengal Assembly polls, which showed that Modi and Amit Shah are not invincible. “If Bengal can do it, so can other states,” Mamata said during the interaction held at the residence of party MP Sukhendu Shekhar Roy. “Puro desh-e khela hobe (the match will be played across the country),” she said, repeating her winning slogan in the Bengal polls. Congress question: As any discussion on an anti-BJP front is incomplete without the Congress, Mamata had to face a flurry of questions — like its record of engineering the collapse of several non-Congress governments — on the role of the grand old party in the proposed front. “I think Soniaji wants Opposition unity. She has invited me for tea and I will go straight from here,” said the Bengal chief minister, who recounted her association with the Congress president since the days of Rajiv Gandhi. The manner in which she fielded the questions on the Congress — despite its poor show in subsequent polls and the leadership crisis in the party — and her meeting with Sonia were perceived as the first attempt towards bringing all the non-BJP parties together. “We had a nice meeting and Rahulji was also present. We discussed the political situation in general. We also discussed the Pegasus issue and the Covid situation in the country,” Mamata said, emerging from the 40-minute meeting. “If the BJP has to be defeated, all the Opposition parties have to come together,” she added while talking to reporters outside 10 Janpath. Cautious Mamata: Since Mamata mooted the proposal for an Opposition platform to take on the BJP in her July 21 address and her party subsequently raised the anti-BJP pitch in Parliament, the Bengal chief minister has got the tag of the main architect of the proposed front. If there is one striking theme of Mamata’s Delhi trip this time, it’s her repeated insistence that she is neither the face of the front nor its main force. “I am a cadre,” Mamata told the news conference. “I want to help in belling the cat…. I am not a VIP,” she added, making it clear that she was not interested in proposing a pole position for herself in the front. The clarification was significant as Trinamul MPs had earlier in the day proposed at a meeting that she should lead the fight against the BJP and be the face of the Opposition. Aware that such an endorsement may come in the way of the front even before its broad contours are defined, Mamata has been cautious on the question of leadership of the alliance. “I am not a political astrologer who can answer questions on leadership of the front…. Everything will depend on the situation,” she said. When pointed out that a fight against Modi without a face may hurt the prospects of the Opposition front, she replied: “The country will fight against Modi…. A lot of faces will come up to save our democracy.” Inclusive approach: More and more parties are likely to join the fight against the BJP in the coming days, Mamata hinted while answering questions on whether attempts would be made to woo some of the BJP allies or parties friendly with the saffron camp in the proposed front. “I maintain good relations with Jaganmohan Reddy, Naveen Patnaik and Chandrababu Naidu…. Some of them may not be with us today, but it doesn’t mean that they won’t come together,” Mamata said. “If a political storm comes, it can sweep away a lot of things,” she added, predicting that a momentum against the BJP is about to develop. According to Mamata, efforts should be made in states like Uttar Pradesh so that parties like the BSP and the SP join hands in the fight against the BJP. Explaining the need for expanding the breadth of the alliance against the BJP, she referred to the recent experience in the Bengal polls that witnessed a triangular fight among the BJP, Trinamul and the Congress-CPM alliance. “The Congress and the CPM should have thought who their primary enemy is,” Mamata said. The chief minister stressed that the regional parties are going to play a larger role in the coming days. “The regional parties are very strong and they should play a lead role,” she said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-382
29-07-2021||India||Catholics mark National Justice Day by paying homage to Stan Swamy||Catholic institutions across India marked National Justice Day on Wednesday, paying homage to Father Stan Swamy who died in custody while awaiting bail in a terrorism case. “During his bail plea, Stan didn’t ask for mercy. He asked for his right, which was bail,” Delhi University professor Apoorvanand said at a public meeting at the Sacred Heart Cathedral in the capital. “He said, ‘Give me bail and I live with my people in Ranchi, or let me die in (Navi Mumbai’s) Taloja Jail’. Demonstrations were held in several states, including Bengal, Jharkhand, Goa, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. In Calcutta, a prayer service for Fr Stan was held at the Archbishop’s House. Activist and former bureaucrat Harsh Mander, who participated at a vigil in New Delhi, told The Telegraph: “It is a sad commentary on where we have reached as a republic when someone who has spent his life in the service of the people — not by providing for their needs but speaking out on their behalf — someone who is a national hero, should die this way.” He added: “We have laws that allow a complete denial of natural justice…. The character of our State is revealed by those it considers enemies, like Stan who led the poor and the dispossessed against State power…. And we have witnessed the sheer cruelty of actors within the criminal justice system…. It was not jail authorities but prisoners who cared for him like a father.” Fr Stan, a Parkinson’s patient, died of multiple ailments blamed on poor treatment of a Covid infection he had contracted during his nine-month stay in jail. In Jamshedpur, nearly 1,000 priests, nuns, sympathisers and rights defenders took part in a silent protest with lighted candles and placards at various Jesuit institutions. “The death of Fr Stan is not an end in itself but an opportunity to reaffirm our faith in our nation’s Constitution and awaken the consciousness of the masses,” said Fr Gerald D’Souza, the administrator at Loyola High School in Jamshedpur. “We had given instructions that there should not be any sloganeering and no disturbance to any public movement,” Fr D’Souza added. “We gathered with the lights in our hands to show our solidarity with… all the Jesuits in the country and support the cause for which Fr Stan lived and died,” said Leena Mukherjee, an employee of Mercy Hospital. In Dindigul, Tamil Nadu, Father Stan’s ashes were carried in an urn for multiple events, including a church service, beginning at Beschi Illam where he had joined the Jesuits in 1957. Later in the day, a memorial service was held at St Joseph’s Cathedral, Dindigul, followed by a public event outside the church where political leaders and local personalities paid their respects. In Goa, memorials and large protest meetings were held in several places including St. Alex Church in Calangute, Our Lady of Immaculate Conception Church in Panjim, Holy Spirit Church in Margao, and Our Lady of Snows Church, Rachol. Jerald D’Souza, director of St Joseph’s College of Law who helped organise an event in Bangalore in Father Stan’s memory, told this newspaper: “Some ask, why should a priest do any work besides pious or religious practices? They (those who ask this question) fail to see the larger issues with democracy and the rule of law that affect the whole system. “They tend to follow the misleading reports in the mainstream media. The court’s withdrawal of its observations on Fr Stan led people to believe he had done something wrong. Despite this, many have come together in solidarity as his death is a wake-up call to many of us.” Last week, a Bombay High Court judge had withdrawn his oral observations praising Father Stan’s work in response to a prosecutor’s request.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-382

The Union health ministry said on Wednesday that it had asked all states to generate district-level data on prevalence of antibodies — a possible signature of protection from the coronavirus — that could be used to guide vaccination campaigns and public health measures. The ministry also released state-level data from a nationwide survey by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) that health experts say suggest that some states such as Assam, Kerala and Maharashtra remain particularly vulnerable to continued spread of the virus. The survey that sampled people from 70 districts in 21 states has found antibody prevalence ranging from 79 per cent in Madhya Pradesh, 76 per cent in Rajasthan and Bihar and 75 per cent in Gujarat to 44 per cent in Kerala, 50 per cent in Assam and 58 per cent in Maharashtra. Nearly 61 per cent of the samples tested in Bengal were positive for antibodies. The states with large proportions of people with antibodies — implying prior Covid-19 infections — are likely to have experienced runaway infections during the epidemic’s two waves, health experts said. On the other hand, the experts said, states such as Kerala or Maharashtra that show lower proportions of people with antibodies appear to have taken stronger containment and public health measures that have protected people from the virus. “But lower antibody prevalence means more people are susceptible to the infection in such states — so they’re more likely to see continued transmission or even surges,” said Manoj Murhekar, director of the ICMR’s National Institute of Epidemiology (NIE), Chennai, the institution that led the nationwide survey in June-July. Health experts have said Kerala’s low seropositivity, or antibody prevalence, is likely contributing to the current rise in daily new infections in the state. The ICMR survey, however, was not designed to capture antibody prevalence data at the district level that could vary widely within states. In Tamil Nadu, for instance, Chennai has an antibody prevalence rate greater than 75 per cent, but in some districts, the number is less than 50 per cent, data generated by the state reveal. Experts say district-level data could guide both vaccination campaigns and preparatory measures. “Districts with lower seropositivity levels (antibody prevalence) could be prioritised for vaccinations,” Murhekar said. State authorities could also channel healthcare resources into districts with low seropositivity that are at greater risk of continuing infections or localised surges. The high prevalence in some states suggests their populations might be approaching herd immunity threshold — a point at which so many people are infected that the virus finds it hard to spread any further in that population — but only district-level data can confirm that. “Overall, it looks like populations in some states are protected,” said Tarun Bhatnagar, a senior epidemiologist at the NIE. “But only district-level data will give us a clear picture. It is possible we’ll continue to see localised spread and surges — a large nationwide wave appears unlikely, unless the virus mutates again.” Bhatnagar said a fast vaccination campaign itself would lower the risk of more mutations.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-382
29-07-2021||India||BJP lawmakers abort parliamentary panel meet on Pegasus||Dissenting BJP lawmakers and absentee government officials on Wednesday forced a parliamentary panel to indefinitely postpone a scheduled meeting on the Pegasus snooping allegations, Opposition members alleged. As the House IT panel met on Parliament premises, the BJP members allegedly refused to sign the attendance register. This ensured a lack of quorum — the minimum attendance needed for a meeting to be officially relevant. Also, the IT and home ministry officials summoned by the committee to answer questions about the snooping charges made “excuses” to stay away, an Opposition MP alleged. No new date has been set for the meeting. Wednesday’s scuttling of the panel meeting comes at a time the government has refused a discussion on the Pegasus controversy in Parliament, betraying its jitters. The parliamentary panel on information technology, headed by former Union minister and Congress member Shashi Tharoor, was to take up the Pegasus allegations under the broad agenda of “Citizens’ data security and privacy”. The BJP members arrived for the meeting but refused to sign the register objecting to the committee’s intention of discussing the Pegasus controversy. The quorum required for the 31-member panel is 10 but only nine members signed the register, sources said. They said the BJP members of the parliamentary panel had since Tuesday begun efforts to scuttle Wednesday’s meeting. On Tuesday, they had boycotted a meeting of the panel on a cinematography-related subject and approached the Lok Sabha Speaker demanding Tharoor’s removal as chairman for trying to take up the Pegasus issue. On Wednesday, a BJP member of the panel, Nishikant Dubey, submitted a privilege notice in the Lok Sabha against Tharoor, accusing him of unilaterally fixing the agenda for the panel’s meetings to suit his “political masters”. He demanded Tharoor’s removal. The agenda for Wednesday’s meeting had, however, been notified by the Lok Sabha secretariat a week ago. Congress MP Karti P. Chidambaram and Trinamul MP Mahua Moitra, who are members of the House IT panel, hit out at the BJP. “@BJP4India members come to the IT Committee & refuse to sign the register to deny a quorum,” Karti tweeted. “Further, all the witnesses called from MiEIT (ministry of electronics and information technology) & MHA (ministry of home affairs) wrote in excuses & didn’t appear as called to testify. It’s very clear that #Pegasus is a no go area for this government.” In a second tweet, Karti said: “The @BJP4India wants to expunge #Pegasus from any debate, scrutiny or enquiry! What are they so afraid of?” Moitra tweeted: “Heights of desperation by @BJP & minions. Nishikant Dubey files privilege motion against @ShashiTharoor just to prevent IT Comm from grilling MHA on Pegasus.” Among the BJP members of the panel are Tejasvi Surya and Locket Chatterjee.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-382
29-07-2021||India||Opposition protests over Farm laws and Pegasus in Lok Sabha||The Opposition on Wednesday protested vehemently as the Lok Sabha Speaker conducted proceedings amid the clamour for a probe into the Pegasus snooping controversy and repeal of the controversial farm laws, completing a week of agitation in the House as the government shows no sign of relenting. The Opposition MPs, mainly from the Congress, tore papers and threw them towards the Speaker’s chair and the Treasury benches after completion of the Question Hour amid the din. The Congress MPs appeared to be particularly angry over their leader Rahul Gandhi not being allowed to speak on Pegasus during the post-noon Zero Hour. After Speaker Om Birla left at noon upon the completion of the Question Hour, BJP MP Rajendra Agrawal was appointed to conduct the proceedings, triggering the first of the day’s multiple adjournments. For the past seven days since the start of the monsoon session, the Lok Sabha has not been able to transact substantial business because of the Opposition’s sustained protests over the Pegasus phone snooping, the farm laws and other issues. On Wednesday, however, Speaker Birla went through with the Question Hour amid loud slogan-shouting and waving of placards against the government. The Speaker did not take any disciplinary action against the Opposition members who hurled balled-up pieces of paper at the Chair. Speaking to reporters later, junior parliamentary affairs minister Arjun Ram Meghwal said “some action would surely be taken”. The government has been fighting shy of a debate on Pegasus, saying that the information technology minister has already made a statement before Parliament. The Opposition has been demanding a discussion in the House and a Supreme Court-monitored probe into the allegations of snooping on judges, journalists, politicians, activists and others using the Israeli spyware Pegasus. The government’s uneasiness over Pegasus was evident yet again on Wednesday when BJP parliamentarian Nishikant Dubey submitted a privilege notice to the Lok Sabha Speaker against Congress MP Shashi Tharoor to demand his removal as chairman of the parliamentary panel on information technology. Tharoor has been pressing for the committee to take up the Pegasus snooping case and summon government officials. Dubey and the other BJP members on the panel are desperate to scuttle any such discussion. The Tharoor-headed panel’s scheduled meeting on Wednesday was postponed due to lack of quorum as BJP members protested and didn’t sign the attendance register. In the 32-member panel, the majority are BJP MPs. Seeking the Chair’s permission to move a privilege motion against Tharoor, Dubey claimed that while the Congress was not allowing any discussion in the House, it wanted the parliamentary panel to take up the Pegasus issue. In his notice, Dubey accused Tharoor of selecting the panel’s agenda to suit his “political masters” and demanded that he be removed. The Chair said the notice had been received and it was being examined by the Speaker. A privilege motion can be moved only if the Speaker finds merit in the notice and refers it to the privilege committee of the House.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-382
29-07-2021||India||Techie held for murder of girlfriend in Odisha||An engineer working in a software company was detained by Odisha police on Wednesday for allegedly murdering his girlfriend by setting her on fire after an altercation over marriage. The incident took place on Tuesday evening at Pratappur village in Ganjam district, around 280km from here. The victim, identified as Subhasmita Khadanga, 25, was rescued by the police from a secluded house on Tuesday evening with critical burn injuries at Pratappur, the native village of accused Krushna Chandra Sahu, 28. Though the police rushed her to the MKCG Hospital in Berhampur, she succumbed to her injuries while undergoing treatment on Tuesday night. Police have seized two spirit bottles and a match box from the spot. Police sources said Sahu and Subhasmita were in a relationship for over a year. While Sahu worked in a software company in Bhubaneswar, the girl was employed in a pathology lab in Ganjam district. They said Subhasmita was insisting on marriage but Sahu was trying to stall it. Police sources said Subhasmita came to Pratappur on Tuesday evening on the invitation of the accused. Both of them met in a secluded house and got embroiled in a heated argument over marriage for an hour. Later, the altercation took an ugly turn and Sahu allegedly set her ablaze. According to the police, Subashmita in her dying declaration said: “When I pleaded with him to marry me, he refused stating that his marriage has been fixed and that he is about to marry the daughter of his uncle.” In Ganjam district, men marrying the daughters of maternal uncles is common. Police said Subhasmita said in her dying declaration that while they were having an argument over the issue of marriage, Sahu got enraged and poured spirit on her and set her ablaze. Purusottampur sub-divisional police officer Suryamani Pradhan told The Telegraph: “Based on the dying declaration of the deceased, we detained BTech engineer Krushna Chandra Sahu. Interrogation is on and it will continue late into the night. Once the interrogation is over, we will take the next course of action. The accused had a love affair with the deceased.” However, Sahu denied the charges on Wednesday. “I was not present when the incident took place. I was busy with my work on my laptop. Subhasmita was mentally deranged. She was undergoing treatment under a psychiatrist in Bhubaneswar. She had even attempted to kill me by giving me poison. All these allegations against me are false,” he told reporters in Ganjam.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-382
29-07-2021||India||RJD claims Tejaswi will replace Nitish Kumar before August 15||The Opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) dropped a bombshell on Wednesday by claiming that its leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav will replace Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and hoist the national flag on Independence Day. “Tejashwi will become the chief minister and hoist the national flag on August 15. Just keep watching what happens in the next few days. A new era will unfold on Independence Day,” said Bhai Virendra, RJD MLA and chief spokesperson of the state unit. The statement added fuel to fire during the monsoon session of the Assembly and drew sharp reactions from the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Virendra said his assertion was based on the fact that smaller constituents of the NDA like former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha Secular and animal husbandry and fisheries minister Mukesh Sahni’s Vikassheel Insaan Party have been openly voicing their dissatisfaction with their position. Both the parties have four MLAs each in the 243-member Bihar Assembly. Though not a large figure, their strength becomes significant because the Nitish-led NDA government is in power with a thin majority. It has 126 legislators and the support of an independent MLA. The Opposition Grand Alliance of the RJD, Congress and Left parties has 110 MLAs. Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM has five lawmakers while one seat is vacant. In such a scenario, if Manjhi and Sahni’s parties withdraw support to the NDA or throw their lot with the Opposition alliance, it could spell doom for the ruling dispensation. The majority figure in the Assembly is 122. The RJD is the largest party in the Assembly with 75 MLAs, and the imminent return of its national president Lalu Prasad to Patna is being eagerly awaited. The arrival of the master strategist and charismatic politician could create new political equations in Bihar, sources said. Virendra’s statements came on a day the RJD boycotted the Question Hour of the Assembly session over its demand for Nitish’s apology and strict action against police officers for manhandling Opposition MLAs in the House on March 23 during the budget session while they were demanding withdrawal of the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021, which conferred unbridled powers to the police. Many RJD legislators came wearing helmets to highlight the safety and security issues in the Assembly. Nitish’s Janata Dal United (JDU) and the BJP dismissed the RJD’s claim and asserted that it was a ploy to save itself from a split. “The RJD is living in illusion. This is the reason behind its wild claims. The people of Bihar have not forgotten the misrule and mayhem they had to suffer when the party was in power for 15 years,” JDU chief spokesperson and former minister Neeraj Kumar said. BJP legislator Nawal Kishore Yadav claimed that the RJD was “making such nonsensical statements to ensure that its MLAs stay with it instead of crossing over to other parties”.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-382
29-07-2021||India||Bihar govt suspends 17 officials for failing to curb illegal sand mining ||The Bihar government has suspended 17 officials, including two IPS officers, for failing to curb illegal sand mining and its trade in the state. Notifications issued by the home department on Tuesday night said that IPS officers Sudhir Kumar Porika and Rakesh Kumar Dubey were being suspended with immediate effect in the light of a report by the economic offences unit of Bihar police for not discharging their duties with regard to illicit mining, storage and transportation of sand in Aurangabad and Bhojpur districts. Porika and Dubey were the superintendents of police of Aurangabad and Bhojpur, respectively. The two officers were transferred earlier this month and had been waiting for posting since then. Both the police officers have been charged with helping those involved in illegal sand mining and transportation, not keeping effective control on junior officers and allegations of suspicious behaviour. Some of the suspended officials are from the Bihar administrative service and mines and geology department posted in the two districts. Others include four deputy superintendents of police and a sub-divisional officer. “We are developing a strategy to check the sand mafia in the state. Raids are being conducted and action against the mafia is being taken on a daily basis. We are going to take tougher actions. Just wait and watch,” mines and geology minister Janak Ram said on Wednesday. Janak also said that 4,180 raids have been conducted, 750 FIRs registered and 538 people arrested till June 30 this year as part of the state government’s crackdown on illegal sand mining. Illegal sand mining is carried out by a well entrenched and well-oiled mafia without any permission from the state government, causing loss of thousands of crores of rupees to the exchequer every year. An alleged nexus with senior government officers and politicians allows the sand mafia to carry out its activities with impunity. Aurangabad, Rohtas and Bhojpur are the worst affected districts by the illegal mining because they lie along the Sone river, which yields the maximum sand in the state. The sand extracted from the Sone is considered to be of the best quality for construction purposes, and is exported to neighbouring states like Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. The mafia has become so brazen that it uses earthmovers, trucks and several men to dig out the sand from the river basin without any fear of punishment. However, the government’s action seems to be focused on some of the affected districts though illegal sand mining is going on unchecked in Jehanabad, Gaya, Banka, Jamui and several other districts, sources said. Many big and small rivers in these districts possess good quality sand.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-382
29-07-2021||India||Blocked sale of Mumbai mansion to Poonawallas on Blinken agenda||Earlier this year, when secretary of state Antony J. Blinken was up for confirmation in Washington, he was hit with a strange question about a piece of property 8,000 miles away on the Arabian Sea. Lincoln House, a former maharajah’s palace and US consulate in Mumbai, was supposed to have been sold six years ago for $110 million (Rs 819 crore). Ever since, the US has been trying to transfer the property to the Poonawalla family, now among the major makers of Covid-19 vaccines, but for unknown reasons the Indian government has been blocking it. The dispute is “an unnecessary irritant in bilateral ties,” Senator James E. Risch said in a written question to Blinken during the confirmation hearing. “Do you commit to making the resolution of the Lincoln House issue a priority with India, and to directing the US ambassador to India to do the same?” “Yes,” Blinken said, and this week he will have a chance to prove his word. He is in India for his first trip to the country as secretary of state, and congressional and administration officials say he intends to bring up this mouldering mansion that is becoming something of a diplomatic black hole. High level diplomatic correspondence reveals how much attention this single property has consumed. Former secretary of state Mike Pompeo vented his frustration last year in a letter to India’s foreign minister, writing “the Government of India has never provided us any credible legal response or explanation of why it has blocked the transfer”. “Regrettably,” Pompeo added, “the Lincoln House saga does not live up to the standards of our relationship.” A year later, with maintenance bills running up, Lincoln House still sits unsold, its high walls crumbling, paint chipping off, rust streaks running down to the sidewalk, an  eyesore. A rambling, haunted-looking, cream-coloured building, it lies in one of Mumbai’s most desirable enclaves — Breach Candy — just a stone’s throw from where soft waves tumble into the shore. Officials in the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi have met requests to discuss the matter with impenetrable silence. More than a half a dozen officials, from the foreign ministry’s chief spokesman to the Mumbai collector  to the principal director-general of the Press Information Bureau, which handles queries concerning Modi’s office, declined to comment. American officials are beyond annoyed. The way they see it, there are no legal reasons to block the sale, and India and the US are supposed to be friends. US officials interviewed by The New York Times seemed perplexed by the hold-up. They suspect Modi’s government doesn’t like the idea of the US making so much money off the deal, which would be one of the biggest house sales in Indian history. Or possibly the Modi government wants to prevent Lincoln House from going to the Poonawallas, who are not among the handful of Indian billionaires known to be Modi stalwarts. Or maybe officials feel uncomfortable with a foreign government simply selling off an iconic piece of Indian history. The three-storey mansion was built in the 1930s in Indian-Deco style by the Maharajah of Wankaner, one of the hundreds of princely states that existed under British rule. M.K. Ranjitsinh was the grandson of the maharajah who built it. “It was very modern for its time,” he said of the home, which had a swimming pool, a cannon out front and a wooden dance floor. But after Independence in 1947, the maharajahs lost their privileges. The upkeep for the house became too much for a minor aristocrat. So in 1959, the Wankaner family sold the rights to the property (Lincoln House is actually on a 900-year-plus lease) to the American government for Rs 16.5 lakh, which would have been around $350,000 at the time. In 2011, the US opened a modern consulate in Mumbai. It was time to say goodbye to Lincoln House. A few years later, when it was put on the market, the Poonawallas snapped it up. The family runs the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, based in Pune. With a penchant for Ferraris and racehorses, the Poonawallas are known for living large and said they planned to use the 50,000-square foot space as a weekend home. In October 2015, India’s foreign ministry gave the US government explicit permission for the deal in a letter saying: “This ministry would like to convey its approval for the sale.” But soon after, another branch of the Indian government, the defence estates officer, objected, saying the Americans had failed to give notice of the sale and cessation of use of the property within a mandated 20-day period. American officials countered that they hadn’t finalised the transaction or stopped using the property and therefore hadn’t broken rules. After the Indian government continued to frustrate the sale, many American officials, including two ambassadors and Pompeo, weighed in, arguing that the sale should go through and urging the Modi administration to help make it happen. US senators sent two letters to Modi. They never received a reply. If the deal is not finalised by the end of August, the Poonawallas have the right to back out, according to the contract. If they do, the American government then faces an expensive question: Now what? There aren’t too many other buyers who can drop $110 million on a home. And because Lincoln House is a heritage property, it would be difficult to knock it down and redevelop. American officials are beginning to worry it could be a total loss.

29-07-2021||India||Congress objects to Rakesh Asthana's appointment||The Congress has objected to the appointment of IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as Delhi police commissioner four days before his retirement, alleging that the Narendra Modi government’s decision was in violation of a Supreme Court guideline. Asthana, a Gujarat-cadre officer, was to retire on July 31. He was appointed Delhi police chief on Tuesday. Delhi police, who report to the Union home ministry, usually get a boss from the AGMUT (Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram-Union Territory) cadre. Asthana was seen as a favourite for appointment as CBI director earlier this year, sources said, but got ruled out when Chief Justice N.V. Ramana cited a Supreme Court guideline that no officer with less than six months of service left should be appointed as a police chief. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said: “Asthana, the blue-eyed boy of the Prime Minister, was appointed Delhi police chief with a Union home ministry notification calling it ‘a special case in public interest’…. it is another instance of blatant disregard for the Supreme Court.” Khera added: “Also, the civil services in India have cadres that are state or region-specific. Vacancies in Delhi are filled from the AGMUT cadre….  Could the government not find any efficient officer within the AGMUT cadre?”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-383
29-07-2021||India||IISER scientist's study peeks into Sun's 'stellar midlife crisis'||Calcutta scientists have proposed an explanation for a mysterious phenomenon called the stellar midlife crisis under which the Sun and many other stars display abrupt, dramatic declines in their output of high energy particles and radiation. Astrophysicist Dibyendu Nandi and his colleagues at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Calcutta, have provided a possible theoretical foundation for the unexplained decline in stellar activity that occurs in stars past their middle age. Multiple earlier studies over the past decade have suggested that the Sun is currently passing through what solar physicists call a “weakened magnetic braking” phase at about its midlife of around 4.5 billion years. Astronomers have also made similar observations with other stars in the galaxy. The Sun and other stars constantly spew electrically-charged particles also called the stellar wind. This steady drain causes stars to slow down their rotation over billions of years. The slower rotation in turn alters the stars’ magnetic fields and reduces activity — sunspots, flares, outbursts — over time. Solar physicists expected the slowdown to occur at a steady pace. But the recent observations have indicated that the rate of slowdown dramatically declines in stars in their middle age. “The observations just did not match the theory — there was no explanation for why the stars abruptly depart from their expected behaviour around middle age,” said Nandi, associate professor at the IISER Centre for Excellence in Space Sciences. Now, Nandi and his collaborators Bindesh Tripathi and Soumitro Banerjee have shown that when certain stars approach their middle age, their magnetic field generation mechanism in them abruptly becomes sub-critical, or less efficient. This change allows a middle-aged star such as the Sun to switch into a low activity mode. “Our hypothesis of a sub-critical magnetic dynamo of solar-like stars provides a self-consistent physical basis for a diversity of solar-stellar phenomenon such as why stars past their midlife do not spin down as fast as they did in their youth,” Nandi said. Tripathi, a student from Nepal who had worked at IISER-CESSI for a Masters project and is currently at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US, is the first author of the study published on Wednesday in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. The study provides key insights into the existence of low activity episodes in the recent history of the Sun, also called the grand minima — when almost no sunspots are visible. One such grand minima had occurred between 1645 and 1715 when very few sunspots had been observed. The researchers say their explanation also provides a theoretical basis for recent observations indicating that the Sun is slipping into a low activity future.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-383
29-07-2021||India||Beijing questions America's 'one-man, one-vote' style of democracy||China on Wednesday questioned the “one-man, one-vote” style of democracy in place in the US and India in view of American secretary of state Antony Blinken’s remarks in New Delhi. Asked for a response to Blinken’s comments on democracy being under threat without directly referring to China, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said: “I want to stress that democracy is a common value shared by all, not a patent owned by any country. To achieve democracy, there are various ways rather than a fixed formula or a standard answer. One man, one vote and a multi-party system is not the sole form of democracy.” Zhao said democracy should not be used as a label or tool to belittle or smear other countries or stoke confrontations. “Which country is a democracy and which an autocracy should not be determined by a very small number of countries. Debasing others while elevating oneself in itself is not democratic at all.” “Some self-proclaimed democracies are deeply troubled at home by wealth disparity, social division, racial divide and political polarisation”.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-383
29-07-2021||India||Washington’s China agenda appears to dominate Blinken’s India visit||Washington’s China agenda appeared to dominate US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s India visit on Wednesday. Not only did he meet a representative of the Dalai Lama in New Delhi, he also underscored the need for democracies to demonstrate their ability to deliver to the people, and sought to temper comments on India's democracy with a reference to the challenges faced on this front at home. Reuters quoted an unnamed state department official as telling reporters travelling with Blinken that the secretary briefly met Ngodup Dongchung Lama, a representative of the Central Tibetan Administration — the official name of the Tibetan government in exile. This was apart from Blinken’s interaction with Geshe Damdul Dorjee, the director of Tibet House, the cultural centre of the Dalai Lama founded in 1965, during a closed-door meeting with civil society leaders where issues like the Citizenship Amendment Act and the prolonged farmers’ protests are said to have come up. These two meetings are likely to anger China, which considers the Dalai Lama as a separatist. While it was evident that Blinken had raised human rights issues and democracy in India during his meetings, he did not say this openly even when asked a pointed question on the country’s “democratic backslide”, strengthening the perception in certain quarters of Washington that the Joe Biden administration is not taking up these issues strongly enough because of the importance it attaches to India’s role in its bid to counter the growing Chinese footprint and does not want to jeopardise that geo-strategic objective. It was external affairs minister S. Jaishankar who was more revealing after volunteering to reply to the question posed to Blinken at a media conference. Jaishankar’s reply made it amply clear that Blinken had echoed concerns in various western capitals about the state of democracy in India in recent years. After Blinken’s long-winding reply to the question on India’s democratic backslide in which he said no democracy, including the US, was perfect and that democracy in both countries was a work in progress, Jaishankar stepped in to say: “The quest for a more perfect union applies as much to the Indian democracy as it does to the American one; indeed to all democracies. “Number two, it is the moral obligation of all polities to really right wrongs when they have been done, including historically, and many of the decisions and policies you have seen in the last few years fall in that category. Third, freedoms are important. We all value them but never equate freedom with non-governance or lack of governance or poor governance.” In his opening remarks, Blinken said: “Our bilateral relationships are strengthened by our shared values. As two of the world’s leading democracies, we take seriously our responsibilities to deliver freedom, equality and opportunity to all of our people, and we know that we must constantly do more on these fronts and neither of us has achieved the ideals that we set for ourselves. Part of the promise of democracy is the constant striving for better, as America’s founders put it, ‘to form a more perfect union’.” Responding to a reference of offering the partnership with India as a democratic alternative to China, Blinken said the shared democratic traditions were part of Wednesday’s conversation. “The relationship between our two countries is so important and so strong because it’s a relationship between our democracies...,” he said, stressing the need for democracies to display they can deliver to the people. “We view Indian democracy as a force for good in defence of a free and open Indo-Pacific, indeed a free and open world. We also recognise that every democracy is a work in progress,” Blinken said. China has described the US agenda in the Indo-Pacific by setting up the Quad with Australia, India and Japan as an Asian Nato, suggesting it is a military alliance. The claim was again countered by Blinken on Wednesday. Apart from Jaishankar, Blinken met national security adviser Ajit Doval and called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Good to meet US Secretary of State @SecBlinken today. I welcome President Biden’s strong commitment to strengthen the India-US Strategic Partnership, which is anchored in our shared democratic values and is a force for global good,” Modi tweeted.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-383
