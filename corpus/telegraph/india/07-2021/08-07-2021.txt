Interacting with members of the Council of Ministers a day after he reshuffled and expanded it, he said India's fight against the pandemic is underway with full vigour with steady vaccination drive and high testing, while sounding a note of caution against any complacency.  "PM said that with the Covid infection numbers being fewer than what they were in the recent months, people may want to venture out. However, everyone must remember that the threat of COVID-19 is far from over. Many other nations are seeing surges in infections. The virus is also mutating," a source said.  He told ministers that the aim should not be to instill fear but to request people to keep taking all possible precautions so that the nation is able to move beyond this pandemic in the times to come.  He also asked ministers to reach office on time and channelise all their energy into their ministerial work, saying their focus should be on helping the most deprived people.  He said the new ministers can meet their predecessors and learn from their experience, sources said.  He told the new ministers that those no longer part of the government have made contributions and newcomers can learn from them, the sources said.  In a word of advice, he said it is the work that only matters and the ministers should not get trapped in the vicious circle of grabbing media attention.  He said ministers should avoid making unnecessary statements.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-456

The statement was the second one in the past week, where the health ministry quashed media reports claiming there was 32 per cent less vaccination in the past one week against the previous one. “It is clarified that all states or UTs are being informed much in advance about the doses that will be available during the month of July 2021, including the supply to private hospitals. The states or UTs have been advised to plan their Covid-19 vaccination sessions based on the availability of the vaccines,” the statement read, as quoted by hindustantimes.com. The ministry also informed that after discussion with the vaccine manufacturers, it had already been conveyed to all states or UTs that they will receive “more than 12 crore doses” of Covid-19 vaccine in July. “Till today morning, over 2.19 crore doses have already been supplied to all states or UTs from July’s supply,” the statement added, reiterating that the health ministry is informing the states “adequately in advance” about the supply of vaccines being sent to them. According to the statement, states or UTs have also been asked to share their demand for vaccine doses with the Centre in case there is a need for more owing to increased coverage. The ministry’s statement on Wednesday comes a day after it struck down media reports claiming Covid-19 vaccine shortage led to the closure of some vaccination centres in Rajasthan. The Centre said Rajasthan had more than 1.69 lakh unutilised stock of vaccine jabs as of July 1, and under the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination programme, the state was given over 8.89 lakh doses of vaccine between July 1 and 6. “In addition, Rajasthan would receive an additional 3,951,000 doses during the remaining part of July 2021. Hence, in entire…July, Rajasthan will receive more than 5,090,000 vaccine doses,” the statement by the health ministry read. The Centre also clarified that Covid-19 vaccines being a biological product, its manufacturing process “takes time” and does not “translate into immediate supply”. Last week, owing to vaccine shortage in Maharashtra, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and state vaccination centres suspended their vaccination drive in Mumbai. On June 29, 3,87,644 Covid-19 vaccine doses were administered in the state, which dropped to 2,56,019 on June 30, and rose marginally to 2,72,714 on July 1. In Uttar Pradesh’s Noida, a government district hospital was flooded by beneficiaries, who flouted coronavirus norms, to get their jabs. Speaking to ANI, the chief medical superintendent said that the crowd was due to the hospital not getting enough vaccines for two days. On Thursday, in a veiled jibe at the appointment of Mansukh Mandaviya as the Union health minister amid cabinet reshuffle, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Does this mean no more vaccine shortage? #change” Notably, Dr Harsh Vardhan’s resignation came as shocking to many as he was widely applauded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his management of the ongoing coronavirus crisis in India.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-456
08-07-2021||India||Cabinet nod to APMCs availing finance from Rs 1 lakh crore agri-infra fund||APMC mandis will now be eligible to avail financial support from the Rs 1 lakh crore Agriculture Infrastructure Fund to expand the regulated markets' capacity and provide better facilities to farmers, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said on Thursday. Tomar also asserted that the decision to further strengthen the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) allays protesting farmers' fear that these mandis will scrapped with the implementation of three controversial agriculture laws. This modification in the central scheme was approved in the cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday. Briefing media about the cabinet decision, Tomar said: "During the Budget (2021-22), we had told that APMCs will not end, rather they would be strengthened further. Keeping that in mind, the Cabinet today decided to allow APMC to utilise the Rs 1 lakh crore financing facility under Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF)." Stating that there was apprehension that APMCs will be abolished, the minister reiterated that these regulated mandis will not end. "After implementation of the three farm laws, APMC will get funds from this agri-infra fund." For APMCs, interest subvention for a loan up to Rs 2 crore will be provided for each project of different infrastructure types like cold storage, sorting, grading and assaying units and silos within the same market yard, he added. APMC markets are set up to provide market linkages and create an ecosystem of post-harvest public infrastructure open to all farmers Not only APMCs, Tomar said the financial facility under this fund has been extended to state agencies, national and state federations, farmer producer organisations (FPOs) as well as federation of self-help groups (SHGs). So far, individuals, organisations, cooperatives, FPOs and agri-start ups and farmers organisations were eligible to avail subvention of 3 per cent per annum for loans up to Rs 2 crore, he added. Under the AIF, a medium to long-term debt financing facility is provided for investment in viable projects for post-harvest management infrastructure and community farming assets through interest subvention and financial support. Among other changes in the scheme, the minister said that currently interest subvention for a loan up to Rs 2 crore in one location is eligible under the scheme. "In case one eligible entity puts up projects in different locations, then all such projects will be now be eligible for interest subvention for loan up to Rs 2 crore," he said. However, for a private sector entity, there will be a limit of a maximum of 25 such projects. However, this limitation will not be applicable to state agencies, national and state federations of cooperatives, federations of FPOs and federation of SHGs, he said. Location will mean physical boundary of a village or town having a distinct LGD (Local Government Directory) code. Each of such projects should be in a location having a separate LGD code. The minister further said the period of financial facility has been extended from 4 to 6 years up to 2025-26. The overall period of the scheme has been extended from 10 to 13 years up to 2032-33. In a separate statement, the government said the power has been delegated to the Union Agriculture Minister to make necessary changes with regard to addition or deletion of beneficiaries in such a manner so that basic spirit of the scheme is not altered. The modifications in the scheme will help to achieve a multiplier effect in generating investments while ensuring that the benefits reach small and marginal farmers, it said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-456
08-07-2021||India||Covid: Cabinet approves Rs 23,123 crore for boosting health infra||The Union cabinet Thursday approved a Rs 23,123-crore package for improving health infrastructure to fight Covid-19 as part of which around 2.4 lakh medical beds and 20,000 ICU ones would be created with a special focus on paediatric care. Addressing a press conference here after the first meeting of the Union cabinet following its reshuffle on Wednesday, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said the package will be implemented over the next nine months till March 2022. The meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mandaviya said this is the second phase of the Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Package as the Central government had given Rs 15,000 crore earlier for setting up Covid-dedicated hospitals and health centres across the country. Under the new package, the Centre would provide Rs 15,000 crore and states Rs 8,123 crore, and the plan would be implemented jointly by them across all the 736 districts to improve medical infrastructure at primary and district health centres. Around 2.4 lakh normal medical beds and 20,000 ICU beds would be created of which 20 percent would be specially earmarked for children, he said. The minister said storage facilities for oxygen and medicines would also be created at district level under the plan. An official statement said states and UTs would be supported to create paediatric units in all 736 districts and to establish Paediatric Centre of Excellence in each state and UT (either in medical colleges, state government hospitals or central hospitals such as AIIMS, INIs, etc) for providing tele-ICU services, mentoring and technical hand-holding to the district paediatric units. They would be supported to augment 20,000 ICU beds in public healthcare system out of which 20 per cent will be pediatric ICU beds, it said. The Phase-II of the package has central sector (CS) and centrally-sponsored schemes (CSS) components. The statement said that under the central sector components, support would be provided to central hospitals, All India Institutes of Medical Sciences, and other Institutions of National Importance under DoHFW for repurposing 6,688 beds for Covid-19 management. National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) would be strengthened by providing genome sequencing machines, besides sanctioning scientific control room, epidemic intelligence services (EIS) and other support, it said. Support would be provided for the implementation of Hospital Management Information System (HMIS) in all the district hospitals of the country (presently, it is implemented only in 310 DHs), the statement said. All district hospitals would implement HMIS through NIC-developed e-Hospital and CDAC developed E-Shushrutsoftwares. This will be the biggest impetus for implementation of the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) at the DHs, the statement said. Support would also be provided for expanding the national architecture of eSanjeevani tele-consultation platform to provide upto 5 lakhs tele-consultations per day from the present 50,000, the statement said. Support would also be provided for IT interventions, including strengthening the Central War room at DoHFW, strengthening the Covid-19 Portal, the 1075 Covid help lines and Co-WIN platform, the statement said. Under the CSS components, efforts are aimed at strengthening district and sub-district capacity for an effective and rapid response to the pandemic. States and UTs would be helped to provide care closer to the community due to the ingress of COVID-19 in rural, peri-urban and tribal areas, by creating pre-fabricated structures for adding additional beds at the existing CHCs, PHCs and SHCs (6-20 bedded units) and support would also be provided to establish bigger field hospitals (50-100 bedded units) depending on the needs at tier-II or tier-III cities and district HQs, the statement said. They would be given help to install 1,050 liquid medical oxygen storage tanks with medical gas pipeline system (MGPS) with an aim to support at least one such unit per district and augment the existing feet of ambulances, the statement said. As many as 8,800 ambulances will be added under the package, it said. Undergraduate and post graduate medical interns and final year MMBS, BSc and GNM nursing students would be engaged for effective Covid management, it added. In March 2020, when the country was faced with the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the PM announced a Central Sector Scheme of Rs. 15,000 crore as the 'India Covid-19 Emergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness Package', the statement said. Since mid-February 2021, the country is experiencing a second wave with spread into rural, peri-urban and tribal areas, the statement added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-456
08-07-2021||India||Supreme Court says election process stands threatened by social media manipulation||The Supreme Court on Thursday said that election process, which is the very foundation of a democratic government, stand threatened by social media manipulation and digital platforms can be imminently uncontrollable at times and carry their own challenges. The apex court said that information explosion in digital age is capable of creating new challenges that are insidiously modulating the debate on issues where opinions can be vastly divided and successful functioning of a liberal democracy can only be ensured when citizens are able to make informed decisions. A bench headed by Justice S K Kaul said that power and potentiality of these intermediaries is vast, running across borders, and these are multinational corporations with large wealth and influence at their command. By the very reason of the platform they provide, their influence extends over populations across borders. Facebook is one such corporation, said the bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy. The top court made the observations in its 188-page judgement dismissing a plea filed by Facebook India Vice President and MD Ajit Mohan and others challenging the summons issued by the Delhi Assembly's Peace and Harmony committee for failing to appear before it as witness in connection with the north-east Delhi riots last year. The technological age has produced digital platforms not like the railway platforms where trains were regulated on arrival and departure. These digital platforms can be imminently uncontrollable at times and carry their own challenges, it said. The bench noted that a testament to the wide-ranging services which Facebook offers is the fact that it has about 2.85 billion monthly active users as of March 2021 and this is over one-third of the total population of this planet. It said that Facebook is the most popular social media platform in India with about 270 million registered users. Such vast powers must necessarily come with responsibility. Entities like Facebook have to remain accountable to those who entrust them with such power. While Facebook has played a crucial role in enabling free speech by providing a voice to the voiceless and a means to escape state censorship, we cannot lose sight of the fact that it has simultaneously become a platform for disruptive messages, voices, and ideologies, it said. Thus, while social media, on the one hand, is enhancing equal and open dialogue between citizens and policy makers; on the other hand, it has become a tool in the hands of various interest groups who have recognised its disruptive potential. This results in a paradoxical outcome where extremist views are peddled into the mainstream, thereby spreading misinformation, it said. The top court said that established independent democracies are seeing the effect of such ripples across the globe and are concerned. Election and voting processes, the very foundation of a democratic government, stand threatened by social media manipulation, it said. The bench said that effect on a stable society can be cataclysmic with citizens being 'polarized and parlayzed' by such 'debates', dividing the society vertically. Less informed individuals might have a tendency to not verify information sourced from friends, or to treat information received from populist leaders as the gospel truth. It said internationally, Facebook has had to recognise its role in failing to prevent division and incitement of offline violence in the context of the stated ethnic cleansing in Myanmar where a crescendo of misinformation and posts, somehow missed by Facebook employees, helped fuel the violence. The platform similarly apologised for its lack of serious response to evident signs of abuse of the platform in Sri Lanka, which again is stated to have stoked widespread violence in 2018 in the country and had to acknowledge its need to be regulated though the exact method is still unclear and a prerogative of law making authority, it said. The top court there have been endeavours by countries like Australia, the US, the UK and the EU for ways to regulate platforms such as Facebook in an efficient manner but their efforts are still at a nascent stage as studies are undertaken to understand the dynamism of the platform and its disruptive potential . The US has also seen heated debates arising from the 2016 Presidential elections with allegations of supposed interference by Russia allegedly facilitated by platforms like Facebook, the bench noted in its verdict. We have penned down a detailed introduction to appreciate the gravity of what was debated before us in the context of Facebook's hands off approach, who have urged that they cannot be compelled to participate in proceedings of sub-committees formed by the parliament or the legislative assemblies, the bench said. The bench said that Delhi Legislative Assembly and its committee have the power to compel attendance of members and outsiders on grounds of its privilege. While acknowledging the distribution of power, it said that though law and order and police do not fall under the legislative domain of Delhi Assembly, in the larger context the concept of peace and harmony goes much beyond that. It said in any case, the representative of the social media giant would have the right to not answer questions directly covered by these two fields.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-457

Jaishankar said on Thursday that there has been a lot of concern about the India-China relationship since last one year because Beijing has not observed agreements on the border issue which has "disturbed" the foundation of the bilateral relationship. "I would say for the last 40 years we had a very stable relation with China China emerged as the second largest trade partner.., Jaishankar said in response to a question on China-India relations at the Primakov Institute of World Economy & International Relations in Moscow. "But for the last one year, there has been a lot of concern about the relationship because China has not observed agreements that it had signed up to when it came to our border, said Jaishankar, who is here on a three-day visit. "After 45 years, we actually had a border incident with casualties. And peace and tranquility on the border, for any country, is the foundation of a relationship with a neighbour. So naturally the foundationship has got disturbed, so has the relationship, he added. India and China were locked in a military standoff at multiple friction points in eastern Ladakh since early May last year. However, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of Pangong lake in February following a series of military and diplomatic talks. The two sides are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points. India has been particularly pressing for disengagement of troops in Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang. According to military officials, each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the LAC in the sensitive high altitude sector. There was no visible forward movement in disengagement of troops in the remaining friction points as the Chinese side did not show flexibility in their approach to this issue at the 11th round of military talks. On a question on the possibility of nuclear arms race between the two countries, Jaishankar dismissed it saying the evolution of the Chinese nuclear program has a much larger dynamic than India. "I don't believe there is a nuclear arms race between India and China. China became a nuclear power in 1964, India in 1998, he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-457

Talking to reporters after her interrogation, Sultana alleged that a five-member police team from Lakshadweep carried out a search at her flat in Kakkanad near here and seized her brother's laptop and sought information about his bank accounts. However, the police was not immediately available for a comment. Sultana said police personnel visited her home without informing her. She alleged that she was being troubled by the police in the name of investigation into the case. Sultana, who was interrogated by the police in Kavaratti last month, said the police visited the flat when she was engaged in the dubbing work of her upcoming movie in a studio here. Earlier, the police had seized her mobile phone when she was summoned to Kavaratti to join the investigation. Sultana was granted bail by the Kerala High Court in connection with the sedition case. The allegation is that the filmmaker, while participating in a debate telecast by a Malayalam news channel on June 7, had said the Centre used biological weapons against the people of Lakshadweep.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-457

Owaisi said during the second wave of Covid, lakhs of people died "due to the UP government" as bodies of the poor were seen floating in the Ganga and dogs found dragging these on the river banks. People were not getting oxygen and beds in hospitals, he said addressing party workers while inaugurating its office in Bahraich city. "Yogi's fight in the coming elections will be with the women made widows and children left orphan by his government," he said, adding that mothers and sisters of UP have expectations from Om Prakash Rajbhar-led Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha, a coalition of smaller parties. The Hyderabad MP also called upon opposition parties to join the Morcha, saying, "We are entering the electoral fray with the resolve not to allow Yogi to become the chief minister again in the 2022 elections." Those (opposition parties) who are afraid of us today should not forget that we did not contest the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, yet they could not defeat Narendra Modi, he said. Owaisi further said they are going to contest the Assembly elections with a bigger motive. We are fighting for our share in power and not to become mere vote bank. Now, we will send our representatives to the Legislative Assembly with our votes. We have also proved this by winning five Vidhan Sabha seats in Bihar, he said in an apparent reference to the Muslim community. Owaisi said all political groups understand that there is no voice of the oppressed and minorities. The drama of those who make us happy by feeding dates during iftars, organise mushairas and qawwali will now come to an end. We are not circus clowns. Instead of becoming a clown who dances at the behest of the ring master, we will now become the ringmaster and make them dance to our directions, he said. Owaisi said the Uttar Pradesh government has so far administered coronavirus vaccine to only three per cent of the state population and called upon the people who attended the programme to get themselves vaccinated. The AIMIM had recently announced that it would contest on 100 seats in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls in alliance with Om Prakash Rajbhar-led Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) and the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha, a front of smaller parties.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-457
08-07-2021||India||Elgaar case: HC questions Maharashtra about judge's jurisdiction||The Bombay High Court on Thursday directed the Maharashtra government to produce documents or records to show that sessions judge K.D. Vadane, who took cognisance of a chargesheet filed by  Pune police against lawyer Sudha Bharadwaj and some of her co-accused in the Elgaar-Parishad-Maoist links case, had the jurisdiction to do so. A bench of Justice S.S. Shinde and Justice N.J. Jamadar gave the direction after noting that the records produced by the high court registry "matched" with the claim made by Bharadwaj that Judge Vadane was not a designated special judge. The bench was referring to the claim made by Bharadwaj through her counsel, senior advocate Yug Chaudhry, in her plea filed in the HC seeking default bail. Earlier this week, Chaudhry had told HC that Judge Vadane was an additional sessions judge, but he had "pretended" to be a "special judge" and remanded Bharadwaj and eight others to Pune police's custody in 2018. Judge Vadane had also taken cognisance of the chargesheet filed by the police in the case even though he had no jurisdiction to do so, Chaudhry had said. He had placed replies that Bharadwaj had received from the high court and the Maharashtra government authorities showing that Judge Vadane had never been designated as a special judge. At the time, the HC had said it wished to confirm the same with the records of the high court registry. On Thursday, the bench said the registry "record matches with what is submitted in the petition." Chaudhry then said that since Bharadwaj and others had been charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), only a designated special court could have taken cognisance of their case. He said in cases of scheduled offences, such as those under the UAPA, a sessions judge has the power to take cognisance only if there exist specific instructions from the "Principal District Judge (PDJ)." At this, the bench asked the Maharashtra government's chief public prosecutor, Aruna Pai, to show if there existed such an order. "Show us any document through which PDJ gave powers to Vadane to hear the matter," the bench said. The bench said there were documents to show that while the Pune police took the case and the chargesheet before Judge Vadane, designated special judges were officiating in special courts in Pune at the time. Pai sought time and said she will provide an answer to the court after taking instructions from relevant authorities. "There is no explanation coming from the government. The IO (investigative officer) should have explained why he didn't go to a special judge," Chaudhry maintained. The court also asked Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, who appeared for the National Investigating Agency (NIA), to respond to the claims made by Chaudhry. The Elgar Parishad case of 2017-2018, which was earlier handled by the Pune police, was later handed over to the NIA and its trial was shifted to Mumbai. Bharadwaj was arrested in August 2018 and placed under house arrest. She was taken into physical custody by the Pune police in September 2018. The NIA took over the investigation in January 2020. On Thursday, ASG Singh told the HC that he did not agree with Chaudhry's submission that only a special judge could have taken cognisance of the case. He said offences under UAPA were serious and hence, the focus must be on their early disposal. "The purpose for this Act (UAPA) is to punish the offender. There has to be expeditious and early disposal of cases. Nothing is above national security," Singh said. "Special judges are not different from sessions judges. It is a sessions judge, who is appointed as a special judge. So, he is not, not competent to handle such cases," he said. The HC adjourned further hearing on the plea to July 15. Bharadwaj has said in her plea that since Judge Vadane had no jurisdiction over the case, he couldn't have remanded her and her co-accused to the Pune police's custody, taken cognisance of the chargesheet, and denied them bail. The HC has tagged similar pleas filed by Bharadwaj's co-accused Arun Ferreira, Anand Teltumbde and Sudhir Dhawale, through advocate R Sathyanarayan, raising objections to Judge Vadane's jurisdiction.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-457
08-07-2021||India||India rejects Pak’s ‘RAW behind Lahore attack’ claim||India on Thursday strongly trashed Pakistan's allegations that Indian spy agency RAW orchestrated last month's bomb blast in Lahore. Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said it is not new for Pakistan to engage in "baseless propaganda" against India. He said Pakistan should focus on setting its own house in order and take credible and verifiable action against terrorism emanating from its soil. The international community is well aware of Pakistan's credentials when it comes to terrorism, he said. On Sunday, Pakistan's National Security Adviser Moeed Yusuf alleged that India was behind the blast outside the house of Hafiz Saeed in Lahore. Saeed is the 2008 Mumbai terror attack mastermind and chief of the banned Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD). Three persons were killed and 24 others injured in the blast. When the blast had taken place, CCTV footage had showed a masked suspect parking the car at the corner of a street near the residence of the JuD chief around 10:40 am on Wednesday. He got out of the car and then disappeared, the official said, adding that the blast occurred around 11:10 am. Reportedly, the suspect had carried out the blast with a timed device. Footage later showed that the driver was picked up from a petrol pump nearby by an accomplice in a car and they drove off, the official had said. Following which, three unidentified terrorists have been named in the FIR in the case. The blast had sparked rumours that Saeed was present in the house. Saeed, a UN-designated terrorist whom the US has placed a USD 10 million bounty on, has been convicted for 36 years imprisonment in five terror financing cases. His punishment is running concurrently. Saeed-led JuD is the front organisation for the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-457

During the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown period, the department had found that anti-social elements were creating fake websites, luring people with the promise of loans and later duping them, a Maharashtra Cyber official said. One such gang had asked people to fill up forms or contact them, and after gaining their confidence, fraudsters asked victims to deposit some processing fees to clear loans, and later duped them, the official said. Since many such cases came to light, the department has issued an advisory asking people to verify logos and other details of financial institutions if they are applying for loans online, he said. People have also been asked to visit the nearest branches of banks before applying for loans to get proper information for their safety, and contact the local police immediately if they fall victim to cyber frauds, the official added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-457

08-07-2021||India||Twitter India chief seeks quashing of UP cops notice asking him to appear in person||Twitter India Managing Director Manish Maheshwari on Thursday sought the quashing of a notice issued by the Uttar Pradesh police seeking his physical presence in connection with a case registered for uploading and circulating a "communal sensitive" video on the platform. Appearing on behalf of Maheshwari before the single bench of Justice G Narendar in the Karnataka High Court, his counsel C V Nagesh contended that the notice under Section 41 -A of the CrPC was issued "without jurisdiction, without the sanction of law." He claimed that the first notice was issued on June 17 under Section 160 of the CrPC. The legal obligation under Section 160 of the CrPC is based upon a person who resides at a place which is located within the territorial jurisdiction of the police station where the crime is registered, the counsel argued. After the notice under Section 160 was issued, Maheshwari told the investigators that he did not know anything about the issue, Nagesh said. He added that even if Maheshwari appeared before them in person, the reply would be the same. "The IO (investigating officer) was not satisfied because there was a hidden agenda. Then what he (IO) did is, he invoked the powers under Section 41-A of the CrPC, which is not right", he alleged. "Law does not empower him (the IO) to do so. It is an act which has been done without the sanction of law," the counsel argued. The Twitter MD resides in Bengaluru, and his office is located in the city, Nagesh pointed out. Maheshwari had earlier indicated that he was prepared to cooperate with the investigation through video conference. The case has been posted for further hearing on Friday. The Ghaziabad (Uttar Pradesh) police issued the notice under Section 41-A of the CrPC on June 21 asking him to report at the Loni Border police station at 10.30 AM on June 24. Maheshwari then approached the Karnataka High Court as he lives in Bengaluru in Karnataka. On June 24, the High Court, in an interim order, restrained the Ghaziabad police from initiating any coercive action against him. Justice Narendar had also maintained that if the police wanted to examine him, they could do so through virtual mode. The Ghaziabad Police on June 15 booked Twitter Inc, Twitter Communications India Pvt. Ltd. (Twitter India), news website The Wire, journalists Mohammed Zubair and Rana Ayyub, besides Congress leaders Salman Nizami, Maskoor Usmani, Shama Mohamed and writer Saba Naqvi. They were booked over the circulation of a video in which an elderly man, Abdul Shamad Saifi, alleges he was thrashed by some young men who also asked him to chant 'Jai Shri Ram' on June five. According to police, the video was shared to cause communal unrest.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-458

Refusing to buy the argument, the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma said if the Devasthanam Board decides not to permit live streaming of the rituals on this ground, it will have to quote a line from the scripture in support of the argument. The government made the submission in an affidavit filed by Advocate General S N Babulkar on Wednesday. The chief justice said he has also read the shastras and nowhere does a line like this appear. However, the high court refused to pass any order regarding the Char Dham Yatra as the matter is pending in the Supreme Court. The court's observation came on the advocate general's submission that the earlier order of the court has been complied with and the Char Dham Yatra has been stayed. He also submitted that a proposal has been sent to the Char Dham Board for the live telecast of the puja but due to the change of chief minister of the state a meeting of the board, which is headed by him, could not take place. The government also reiterated that people are opposed to live streaming as it is not allowed by the scriptures. "On the one hand, you are saying that it will be decided while on the other you say that it is not acceptable as per scripture. I have also read the scriptures, tell me in which verse is this ban imposed?" the chief justice asked. Citing an example from the epic Mahabharata, the chief justice said if Sanjay could give an account of the war to Dhritarashtra through live broadcast, why can't the state government live stream rituals at Char Dham.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-458

Their grave health condition ranges from chronic liver or kidney disease to hepatitis B virus infection, doctors said. “They were flown to Delhi on July 2 in a special chartered flight after the Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions were eased for international travel,” a spokesperson of Apollo hospital here said. Many patients from abroad visit the city from time to time for medical advice and treatment but the second wave of the Covid had put a halt on their travel, prolonging their suffering. The spokesperson said the 24 patients from Myanmar are currently kept in a 12-day quarantine, after which their condition will be assessed for transplant procedures, some may not need it and would require just specialised medical care. “The patients were suffering from chronic liver, kidney and cardio-vascular diseases and had been waiting for organ transplant and specialised medical treatment for over six months. “Fortunately with ease in international travel and immense support by embassies of the countries we have been able to get them to India to our centre for medical assistance,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director, Apollo Hospitals. Doctors at the hospital in south Delhi said these patients have been in "grave health condition" and any further delay in medical intervention "could have been fatal". One of the patients is a 48-year-old man who had been suffering from chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), this is progressive and irreversible condition that causes the tissues to scar. The man had been waiting for treatment for over six months and hence his condition had progressed into induced liver cancer," said Dr Neerav Goyal, senior consultant, liver transplant, at the hospital. His condition was initially managed in Myanmar with chemo embolisation and last week he was brought to Delhi in a specialised charter flight, along with 23 other such patients for organ transplant, he added. Delhi had been hit hard with the second wave of the pandemic and the oxygen supply shortage issue at various hospitals here added to the woes of the people. The coronavirus pandemic situation has improved a bit in the last few weeks. Non-Covid patients, especially those suffering from cancer or chronic ailments, and pregnant women had to go through a great deal of hardship in the April-June period.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-458

According to the Prime Minister's Office, Modi noted that technological and R&D institutions will play a major role in the upcoming decade, which, he added, is also being called as "India's Techade". Interacting with over 100 heads of institutions via video-conferencing, Modi highlighted the need to focus on developing futuristic solutions in the fields of education, healthcare, agriculture, defense, and cyber technologies. He also lauded the research and development work done by these institutions towards meeting the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and appreciated the efforts of young innovators towards providing quick technological solutions. In a tweet, Modi later said, "Had an enriching interaction with Directors of leading IITs and @iiscbangalore during which we exchanged thoughts on a wide range of subjects including making India a hub for R&D, innovation and popularising science among the youth." Emphasising the need to adapt to changing environment and emerging challenges, Modi said this requires the institutions to reinvent and reevaluate themselves, develop alternative and innovative models in accordance with the present and future needs of the country and society. He stressed that the country's higher educational and technical institutions need to prepare the youth for continuous disruptions and changes, keeping in mind the fourth industrial revolution, the PMO said. He underlined the need to progress towards education models that are flexible, seamless, and are able to provide learning opportunities according to the requirements of the learners. He said that access, affordability, equity, and quality should be the core values of such education models. Appreciating the improvement in the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) in higher education in the past few years, Modi said digitalization of higher education can play a big role in increasing GER, and students will have easier access to good quality and affordable education. He also highlighted the need to develop an ecosystem of technological education in Indian languages and translate global journals into regional languages. "Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan" (Self-reliant India campaign) will form the basis of dreams and aspirations of India in the coming 25 years when it celebrates 100 years of Independence, he said. Newly appointed Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and the Ministers of State for Education were present during the interaction. During the interaction, Prof Govindan Rangarajan of IISc Bangalore, Prof Subhasis Chaudhuri of IIT Bombay, Prof. Bhaskar Ramamurthi of IIT Madras, and Prof Abhay Karandikar of IIT Kanpur gave presentations to the prime minister and highlighted various ongoing projects, academic work, and new research being done in the country.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-458

A bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy termed Mohan's plea as pre-mature and said nothing has happened against him before Delhi Assembly's panel. The verdict came on plea filed by Mohan, Facebook India Online Services Pvt Ltd and Facebook Inc who contended that the committee lacks power to summon or hold petitioners in breach of its privileges for failing to appear and it was exceeding its Constitutional limits. They have challenged last year's September 10 and 18 notices issued by the committee that sought Mohan's presence before the panel which is probing the Delhi riots and Facebook's role in spread of the alleged hate speeches. According to an NDTV report, the apex court while passing the verdict underlined that te Delhi Assembly committee has the “right to seek information on any matter related to peace and harmony without encroaching (the) domain of the central laws.” During the hearing it also NDTV mentioned that the court observed, “Social media platforms have the power and potential to influence people across the border. Debates on these platforms, like Facebook, have the potential to polarise the society and less informed individuals may not verify the information and take it as gospel of truth.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-458

Vaishnav was talking to reporters after meeting BJP general secretary (Organisation) B L Santhosh at the party office here. On a question that Twitter was not adhering to IT rules, he said whosoever lives and works in India will have to abide by the rules of the country. Twitter, in loggerheads with the Indian government for a slew of issues over months, told the Delhi High Court on Thursday that it needs eight weeks' time to appoint a new grievance officer in compliance with the recently-enacted IT rules of the country. According to an NDTV report, the social media giant also informed the court that it has appointed an interim chief compliance officer, who is a resident of India, two days ago and will submit its first compliance report by July 11. The microblogging platform said it has appointed interim chief compliance officer (CCO) with effect from July 6 and a communication has also been addressed to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY). US-based company Twitter has been in the eye of a storm over its alleged failure to comply with the new IT rules in India, which mandates, among other requirements, the appointment of three key personnel -- chief compliance officer, nodal officer and grievance officer by social media platforms with over 50 lakh users. All the three personnel have to be residents in India. While the rules came into effect on May 26, Twitter is yet to adhere to the social media guidelines, despite repeated reminders from the government. Vaishnaw's statement echoes his predecessor Ravi Shankhar Prasad who had made similar comments days before quitting his post. He had sparred several times with Twitter on this issue, frequently criticising the company for non-compliance and failure to follow laws in India, and also got his account blocked on Twitter for over an hour. "You operate in India, you make money in India... but if you take the position 'I will only be governed by laws of America'...This is plainly not acceptable," Prasad had said earlier. Vaishnaw, the MP from Odisha, on Wednesday took oath as the Cabinet Minister and was given the charge of Railways along with the Information and Technology Ministry. He said was thankful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for giving him the responsibility. He said his focus will be on improving the life of the last man standing in the queue. In past, Vaishnav, while speaking in the Rajya Sabha, had raised the issue of cyber bullying of Karnataka-based Rashmi Samant's resignation from the position of Oxford Student Union President in the United Kingdom and described it as a serious case of racism.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-458
08-07-2021||India||Farmers protest fuel price hike, demand rates to be halved||Farmers agitating against the new agriculture laws on Thursday came together to raise their voices against the recent price hike of petrol, diesel and cooking oil, demanding that the rates be halved with immediate effect. Called by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the two-hour-long protest from 10 am to 12 noon, saw farmers in different parts of the country gather on the sides of national and state highways along with their vehicles, in an attempt to draw the government's attention towards their plight following the fuel price hike. Today, farmers protested for two hours against the high fuel prices. We want them to be halved immediately. Protesters brought their motorcycles, cars, tractors and other vehicles and held sit-in protests, said farmer leader Lakhbir Singh. He added that the demonstrations were held peacefully. While petrol on Wednesday crossed Rs 100/litre in Delhi and several other cities, diesel is currently priced at Rs 89.59/litre. Another farmer leader Avtar Singh Mehma said protests were held not just at the Delhi borders where the farmers' protest against the three farm laws is underway, but across several state and national highways in the country. However, it was ensured that the protests did not block traffic on these roads. Protesters brought their motorcycles, cars, tractors and other vehicles and sat on roadsides. Housewives also came out in large numbers to participate in the agitation with empty gas cylinders, Mehma said. While it was too soon to zero in on the number of protesters, demonstrations were held at thousands of places in the country, he said. Mehma said his native district of Ferozabad in Punjab saw protests at 25 different places. The government is made by the people, so it is important that it listens to them. The government should take charge of the fuel prices in its own hands instead of leaving it to the corporations, he said. As part of the agitation on Thursday, farmers also observed horn baja diwas' during which they honked their vehicles for five minutes to draw the attention of the government, which, according to them, has not been listening to them despite their continued agitation for over seven months. A call was made to all farmers across the country to come out with their tractors and vehicles on main roads and highways across the country and blow horns so that the government takes note of the protest, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) media in-charge Dharmendra Malik said. Farmers have been protesting in huge numbers at Delhi's borders since November 2020, demanding the repeal of the three farm laws which, they fear, will do away with the Minimum Support Price system, leaving them at the mercy of the corporates. The government, however, has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-458

08-07-2021||India|| Rahul Gandhi takes jibe at health minister Mansukh Mandaviya as he assumes charge||Soon after the new health minister Mansukh Mandavia assumed charge, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday asked whether it will change anything and there will be no vaccine shortage. "Does this mean no more vaccine shortage," he asked on Twitter, using the hashtag "#Change". The Congress has been criticising the government's vaccination policy, alleging that it is moving at a slow pace and needs to be accelerated. The BJP, however, hit back at Gandhi with its spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia alleging that the former Congress chief is "irresponsible" and is criticising for the sake of doing so. "We would, however, welcome his constructive criticism," Bhatia said. The Congress has earlier said that the dropping of former Health Minister Harsh Vardhan is an admission of the government's failure in handling of the pandemic. Earlier Congress leader P Chidambaram said the first task of the new Health Minister Mansukh Mandavia is to remove vaccine shortage as some states are facing acute shortages. He said vaccinations have been suspended at several centres in Tamil Nadu as vaccines have run out of supply. "Once again, vaccination has been suspended at several centres in Tamil Nadu because they have run out of vaccines. "The first task of the new Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya will be to ensure adequate and uninterrupted supply of vaccines to all States," Chidambaram tweeted. "No more games to enter the Guinness Book of Records please. Just focus on the supply of vaccines to all the States," he also said. Mandaviya, a BJP leader from Gujarat's Saurashtra region, replaces Dr Harsh Vardhan, who was dropped from the Council of Ministers on Wednesday. His portfolio assumes utmost significance as the country is in battling a coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-459
08-07-2021||India||Twitter seeks 8 weeks to appoint grievance officer||The Delhi High Court on Thursday granted two weeks' to Twitter Inc to file an affidavit, notarised in the United States, on compliance with the new Information Technology (IT) Rules in New Delhi and made it clear that it was not extending any protection to the micro-blogging platform. The high court said the Central government was free to take action against Twitter Inc in case of any breach of the new IT Rules. "It is made clear that since this court has not passed any interim order, this court has granted time to Respondent No 2 (Twitter Inc) to file affidavit, no protection is granted. It is open to Centre to take action against the Respondent 2 in case of any breach of the Rules," a bench of Justice Rekha Palli said while listing the matter for further hearing on July 28. Senior advocate Sajan Poovayya, representing Twitter, told the court that it was not seeking any protection either. The consequence (of non-compliance) is that the protection to intermediaries falls off. I'm not seeking any protection , he said. The high court also directed that affidavits on compliance with the rules be also filed by the officers appointed by Twitter under the new IT Rules. "Twitter prays for two weeks' time for filing notarised affidavit of competent official of respondent nos 2 (Twitter Inc). Two weeks time is granted. Scanned copies to be filed by Tuesday, July 13," the high court said after Poovayya submitted that he would get notarised affidavit from the U.S and the same would require some time. The high court on July 6 had directed Twitter to inform it by July 8 as to when it will appoint a resident grievance officer (RGO) in compliance with the new IT Rules. Poovayya told the court that pursuant to the direction, a note was filed, clarifying the status of appointment of the interim chief compliance officer (CCO), interim RGO as well as a nodal contact person on interim basis. While an interim CCO has already been appointed on July 6, an interim RGO and interim nodal contact officer will be appointed by July 11 and within two weeks, respectively, Poovayya told the court and said that Twitter was actively recruiting for a permanent position. He said that usage of interim would not lessen the responsibilities imposed on these officers to ensure compliance with the new IT Rules. The high court, however, said, "Tomorrow you may take benefit of 'interim'. This (your stand) is neither in the letter (to the Centre) nor on an affidavit." Poovayya explained that since Twitter was in the process of setting up a liaison office in India, it could not appoint permanent employees. "Interim does not take away the responsibility of the officer under the rules. A permanent employee without a liaison office would have tax issues etc. There is no difference in obligation," he told the bench. Poovayya added that presently, the contact address of Twitter Inc was that of a legal counsel in Bengaluru and that he was unable to put a date as to when the liaison office would be established in India. "It is admittedly not done in three months. COVID and a lot of other precipitative things happened. By the end of this week, we will file a compliance report," he explained. The senior advocate clarified that compliance was without prejudice to Twitter's right to challenge the new IT Rules. Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, appearing for Centre, objected to the absence of any affidavit and affirmation from Twitter. With regards to Twitter's stand that it would endeavour in good faith to comply with the rules and appointment of officers was via a third party contractor, the law officer said that he sought accountability from the micro blogging website. "This is not diplomatic parlance. We want accountability, full accountability of great servitude. It can't be left in half-way house via third party," Sharma said. Poovayya explained that the word endeavour was used to avoid being in contempt of court in case of non-compliance, to which the court responded, "You are already in contempt. Now you are trying to salvage the situation." The court nonetheless added that it would take Twitter has the bonafide intent to comply with the rules. The Centre said in its affidavit that Twitter has failed to comply with India's new IT Rules, which could lead to its losing immunity conferred under the IT Act. The affidavit had said that Twitter has failed to comply with the IT Rules, 2021 as on July 1 for the following reasons -- chief compliance officer has not been appointed; the positions of RGO and nodal contact person are vacant, and the physical contact address, which was shown to be there on May 29, is not available again on Twitter website. Petitioner-lawyer Amit Acharya, represented through Senior Advocate G Tushar Rao and advocate Akash Bajpai, said in his plea that he came to know about the alleged non-compliance when he tried to lodge a complaint against a couple of tweets||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-459

His portfolio assumes utmost significance as the country is in battling a coronavirus pandemic. Mandaviya will also lead the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers. "Mansukh Mandaviya takes charge as Union Minister of Health & Family Welfare at Nirman Bhawan today (Thursday)," the Health Ministry said. Mandaviya was on Wednesday elevated to Cabinet rank from minister of state (MoS). He was holding the independent charge of the Shipping Ministry and was MoS for the Chemicals and Fertilizers Ministry. Bureaucrat-entrepreneur-turned-politician Ashwini Vaishnaw took charge as the country's new railway minister. A former IAS officer of the 1994-batch, Vaishnaw has handled important responsibilities for over 15 years and was particularly known for his contribution to the public-private partnership (PPP) framework in infrastructure, something that will help him in the rail sector. He has also held leadership roles across major global companies such as General Electric and Siemens. Vaishnaw has done his MBA from the Wharton School, Pennsylvania University, and M.Tech from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur. He will also hold two other important portfolios of Communications and Electronics and Information Technology. "Excellent work has been done in the Railways over the past 67 years. I am here to take the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi forward," Vaishnaw said while he took the charge. Anurag Thakur similarly took charge as the Minister of Information and Broadcasting. Speaking to reporters after assuming charge, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done a great job in reaching out to people in the last seven years through this ministry, and that he would like to take the legacy forward. Thakur said he would like to reach out to people through the ministry. "I will make every possible effort to carry out the responsibility bestowed upon me by the prime minister," he said. Kiren Rijiju on the other hand took charge as the new minister of Law and Justice. A prominent face from the northeast in the Modi government, Rijiju was on Wednesday elevated as a Cabinet minister in a major reshuffle and expansion of the Union Council of Ministers. Rijiju takes over the key ministry from Ravi Shankar Prasad, who has resigned from the government. The Law Ministry is responsible to defend the government in various courts through its law officers and help ministries draft bills and key documents. It also plays a role in transfer, posting and elevation of Supreme Court and high court judges. The Cabinet overhaul that came ahead of key Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh next year saw 36 new faces on Wednesday. Among them, eight are lawyers, four are doctors, two are former IAS officers and four MBA degree holders, besides several engineers, making it an eclectic mix of professionals in what is seen as an attempt by the prime minister to give a boost to the governance quotient ahead of a string of assembly elections and the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Besides 15 Cabinet ministers, 28 Ministers of State, comprising new faces and those elevated, were sworn in at a ceremony held in the Darbar Hall of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. President Ram Nath Kovind administered the oath of office and secrecy to the 43 ministers including the seven elevated to the Cabinet with all COVID protocol in place. Hours before the ceremony, 11 ministers resigned while another minister Thaawarchand Gehlot quit on Monday after being made the Governor of Karnataka. The resignations of all the 12 ministers were accepted by President Kovind. The total strength of the Council of Ministers now stands at 78, including the Prime Minister. The prime minister can have up to 81 members in his Union Council(15 per cent of the Lok Sabha strength).||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-459

08-07-2021||India||Former Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh passes away||Former Himachal Pradesh chief minister and senior Congress leader Virbhadra Singh died in Shimla in the wee hours of Thursday after a prolonged illness. He was 87. The veteran leader breathed his last at Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) here at 3.40 am, senior medical superintendent Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) Dr. Janak Raj said. He suffered from heart attack on Monday and was critical. He was in the critical care unit of IGMC. Virbhadra was put on ventilator under the supervision of the doctors of the cardiology department on Wednesday after he had breathing problem, he added. The nine-time MLA and five-time MP, Singh served as Himachal Pradesh's chief minister for six times. Virbhadra was tested positive for COVID-19 on June 11 for the second time in two months.

Singh had returned home in Holly Lodge here on April 30 from the Chandigarh hospital after getting cured of the first infection. However, he was admitted to IGMC within hours after reaching home, as he complained of cardiac and breathing problems. He was under treatment in the hospital ever since then. Singh's wife Pratibha Singh and the couple's son Vikramaditya Singh are also politicians. Pratibha is former MP, while Vikramaditya is MLA from Shimla rural. They had celebrated Singh's 87th birthday at their residence at Holly Lodge in a simple manner by cutting a cake in the presence of their supporters on June 23. At that time, Virbhadra was convalescing at the IGMC.

08-07-2021||India||India records 45,892 Covid-19 cases in a single day as numbers rise again||India recorded a single-day rise of 45,892 new Covid-19 cases, taking its infection tally to 3,07,09,557, while the count of active cases increased slightly to 4,60,704 after being on a consistent downward trend for nearly 55 days, according to the Union Health Ministry on Thursday. The death toll has climbed to 4,05,028 with 817 new fatalities being reported. The number of active cases comprises 1.50 per cent of the total infections, while the national Covid-19 recovery rate stands at 97.18 per cent, data updated by the ministry at 8 am showed. An increase of 784 cases has been recorded in the active Covid-19 caseload in a span of 24 hours, it showed. Also, 18,93,800 Covid-19 tests were conducted in the country on Wednesday, taking the total number of such examinations so far to 42,52,25,897, while the daily positivity rate was recorded at 2.42 per cent. It has been less than three per cent for 17 consecutive days, the ministry said. The weekly positivity rate has declined to 2.37 per cent, according to the health ministry. The number of people who have recuperated from the disease surged to 2,98,43,825, while the case fatality rate stands at 1.32 per cent, the data stated. The total number of vaccine doses administered so far has reached 36.48 crore under the nationwide vaccination drive. India's COVID-19 tally had crossed the 20-lakh mark on August 7 last year, 30 lakh on August 23, 40 lakh on September 5, 50 lakh on September 16, 60 lakh on September 28, 70 lakh on October 11, 80 lakh on October 29, 90 lakh on November 20 and one crore on December 19.

08-07-2021||India||Cabinet: 12 ministers dropped, 36 new recruited, 7 promoted||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday expanded and shuffled his ministry, dropping 12 incumbents, recruiting 36 new members and promoting 7 ministers of state in what appeared an attempt to refurbish the image of a government scarred by Covid and economic mismanagement. The replacement of a host of senior ministers with fresh inductees is being seen as an exercise to safeguard Modi’s reputation as a leader who means business and create a distraction from the problems besetting the people. Government managers went to town hailing the “youngest council of ministers ever, largest representation of women, backwards, Dalits, tribals and highly educated people”. However, it was the exits of heavyweights such as Harsh Vardhan, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Prakash Javadekar, Ramesh Pokhriyal and Santosh Gangwar that created the bigger flutter, appearing to reflect a government acknowledgment of failure on key fronts such as health, education, labour, IT and information and broadcasting. While health minister Harsh Vardhan’s sacking caused some surprise despite the mismanagement of the Covid second wave, the departures of Prasad (law, IT) and Javadekar (I&B, environment) caused the greatest stir. Prasad, an MP from Patna who was part of Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government and Modi’s first ministry too, had been spearheading the government’s run-ins with Twitter over the new IT laws. He and Javadekar had both functioned as chief spokespersons for not just the government but also the party. It’s being speculated that they have been punished for failing to protect the government’s image, particularly before the international media where it has been battered over its handling of Covid and its record on human rights and democracy. Many saw in the sackings a search for fall guys given Modi himself takes most of the crucial decisions. The Modi government now has 77 ministers, up from 53 and just 4 short of the permissible upper limit of 81. The strength of the council of ministers cannot exceed 15 per cent of the strength of the Lok Sabha. Such a bloated ministry belies Modi’s promise of “minimum government, maximum governance”. Apart from polishing the Prime Minister’s image, the choice of the new faces —  the overwhelming majority of them first-time ministers — seemed dictated by the five state elections due next year. Among the prominent new arrivals are Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sarbananda Sonowal and Bhupender Yadav. Jyotiraditya has been rewarded for defecting and helping the BJP bring down the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh. Sonowal has been compensated for the loss of the Assam chief minister’s chair, which he had obediently handed over to Amit Shah favourite Himanta Biswa Sarma. Yadav, a BJP general secretary, is also known to be a Shah confidant. Bhagwat Karad, a medical doctor, has been inducted from Maharashtra and Rajya Sabha MP Ashwini Vaishnaw, an IIT graduate and MTech, from Odisha. Seven of the new faces are from Uttar Pradesh, where polls are due by March. Among them is Anupriya Patel, chief of BJP ally Apna Dal which has an OBC Kurmi vote base. Patel has been made a minister of state. Six BJP lawmakers from the heartland state --- three Dalits, two OBCs and one Brahmin – have been sworn in. The BJP is looking to win over the backwards and Dalits in Uttar Pradesh apart from relying on its core upper caste base. Darshana Ben Jardosh, a first-time woman minister, has been inducted from Gujarat, the home state of Modi and Shah, and two junior ministers from the state have been elevated to cabinet rank. Gujarat votes at the end of 2022 but reports say the state BJP is wracked by infighting. Four have been inducted from Maharashtra, where the BJP is desperate to pull down the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government. Among them is former chief minister Narayan Rane, who had started out with the Shiv Sena, shifted to the Congress and eventually embraced the BJP. From Bihar, JDU member R.C.P. Singh, who is close to chief minister Nitish Kumar, has been sworn in. He is the lone minister from an ally that had sought four berths. Pashupati Paras, the LJP member who led the coup against his nephew Chirag Paswan – Nitish’s bête noire -- has been included.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-459
08-07-2021||India||Ministerial resignations mark lead-up to Union cabinet shuffle||A spate of ministerial resignations from Wednesday afternoon marked the lead-up to the evening’s Union cabinet shuffle, the mayhem enlivened by Babul Supriyo who candidly admitted being “asked to resign” before quickly amending the disclosure. Several key ministers were among the 12 who were dropped, their departures suggesting a government admission of failure in areas such as health and education, both severely impacted by the Covid crisis. Among the cabinet ministers to resign — the government strove to cloak the open secret that they had been “pushed” — was health minister Harsh Vardhan, who helmed the Covid response that has brought worldwide scorn on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Also gone were heavyweights Ravi Shankar Prasad, who held the crucial law and IT ministries and led the government charge against Twitter, and Prakash Javadekar whose information and broadcasting portfolio made him the government’s official spokesperson. Javadekar also held charge of the environment, forests and climate change ministry. The rolling of heads seemed to reflect a hunt for scapegoats in a heavily centralised administration where a Prime Minister who took all the decisions desperately needed an image boost. The cat was let out of the bag when Babul, junior environment minister and Asansol MP, wrote initially in a Facebook post: “Yes, I have been asked to resign & I have!!” Unsurprisingly, he had to recant shortly afterwards, removing the earlier post and issuing a clarification: “Yes, I have resigned from the council of ministers (As I had framed it earlier, ‘Asked to resign’ may not be the right way to put it).” Babul said he felt sad but was happy for the new faces from Bengal entering the government. Raiganj MP Debasree Chaudhuri, junior minister for women and child development, too stepped down. Babul and Debasree made way for fellow Bengal MPs Shantanu Thakur, the Matua community leader, and Nisith Pramanik, reflecting a consistent pattern of the replacements (not portfolios)being picked from the same state or region. Harsh Vardhan, 66, has been replaced with fellow Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi, 54. Lekhi will be minister of state in the external affairs and culture ministries. Government and BJP sources said the ministers who quit had been dropped following an extensive review by Modi. They said these ministers received calls from the leadership saying the Prime Minister wanted them to put in their papers. The first two resignations to become public were those of education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal and labour minister Santosh Gangwar. Another cabinet minister to step down was Sadananda Gowda (chemicals and fertilisers), who is from Karnataka. Pokhriyal cited poor health while the 72-year-old Gangwar said he would reveal the reason for his exit in a couple of days. On Tuesday, the 73-year-old Thaawar Chand Gehlot had been eased out as social justice minister and appointed governor of Karnataka. Sources in the BJP said Modi wanted his cabinet “young and dynamic”. The resignations by Prasad and Javadekar became known only when the President’s office issued a media release ahead of the swearing-in of the new faces and promoted junior ministers. “The President, as advised by the Prime Minister, has accepted the resignations of the following members of the council of ministers, with immediate effect,” the release said, listing 12 names including that of Gehlot.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-459
08-07-2021||India||Dilip Kumar passes away at 98 in Mumbai||He was a man of many records. But when Dilip Kumar slipped away on Wednesday, July 7, 2021, in Mumbai, he also held an unbeaten record as the celebrity who died the maximum number of times. No Indian actor passed on as many times as Dilip Kumar did. Ever since he turned 90 in 2012, frequent reports of his “sad demise” would spread so far and wide, and with such authenticity, that when he quietly passed away at age 98, every news outlet heard it with disbelief at first and then double-checked it before putting it out as confirmed information. Another phenomenon exclusive to Dilip Kumar was that every time he “died”, the grief was tangible, intense and widespread like repeated bouts of catharsis. This was no mean achievement when his last successful commercial outing was 30 years ago in Subhash Ghai’s Saudagar (1991) and several generations had grown up without being hit by the Dilip Kumar charisma. But the reverence for a legend in his own lifetime stayed until his last breath. Till the end, just a photograph of Dilip Kumar in his formal suit — or in a homely kurta, hair combed neatly, his mind in a world of its own — put out by wife Saira on Twitter would prompt thousands of reactions from a legion of fans. Dilip Kumar was born to create headlines long after he’d wrapped up his last box-office hit. He did it when he turned director, officially for the first time in 1992. Little snippets and inside stories about Kalinga, the thespian’s heavy-budget directorial debut, would regularly blaze the print medium until it was officially shelved. There were differences between the creative mind and the budgetary head (producer Sudhakar Bokade) that were irreconcilable. It was one of the most disappointing ironies of the actor’s career that after he’d spent a good portion of his life directing his films like a backseat driver, the one time he stepped forward to officially helm a film, it never saw the light of day. Ganga Jumna, a dacoit-crime blockbuster in 1961, was one of the first films where it was whispered that although Nitin Bose was the official director, the actor’s contribution had gone beyond being its official producer and screenplay writer. That whisper persisted right till 1976 when I myself met veteran director Asit Sen outside the set of Bairaag (1976) while filming was going on inside, with the hero calling the shots. Dilip Kumar couldn’t sign off his acting career with a flourish as Qila, his last release in 1998, was a failure and Afsar, co-starring Ajay Devgn, didn’t progress beyond an announcement in 2001. Somewhat like Don Bradman who got out for a duck in his last match. But none of these latter-day setbacks mattered to the man known as “the thespian” whose illustrious innings stretched from the ’40s to the ’90s, spanning six glorious decades and witnessing vital changes in the film industry. Born Mohammed Yusuf Khan in Peshawar on December 11, 1922, he had to morph into the more acceptable Dilip Kumar in keeping with the trend of the ’40s, ’50s and ’60s, a name change suggested by his first producer, Devika Rani of Bombay Talkies (Jwar Bhata, 1944). Unimaginable in times when a Khan trinity rules the box office, but it had to be a Dilip Kumar-Dev Anand-Raj Kapoor at the top in the ’40s and ’50s. Dilip Kumar also reigned at a time when actors didn’t do stage shows or work in commercials, principles that he adhered to in his endeavour not to overexpose himself. It contrasted with his senior Bombay Talkies colleague, Ashok Kumar, who merrily traipsed along with the times as he went up on stage many a time to recite his rap number “Rail gaadi chuk chuk chuk chuk” or did a paan masala ad with Shammi Kapoor. The effortless Ashok Kumar even had a thing or two to say about Dilip Kumar’s renowned method acting. Dadamoni, as Ashok Kumar was called, once told me about the time Dilip Kumar ran around the studio several times and came back panting to give a shot where he had to look exhausted. “I asked Yusuf, how will you prepare for a death scene?” Ashok Kumar had chuckled. But Dilip Kumar’s method acting worked for him. Famous for his natural acting and the pauses in his dialogues, he also held a record for the number of Dilip Kumar spin-offs he spawned. Practically every second famous name, from Rajendra Kumar and Manoj Kumar to Amitabh Bachchan, Naseeruddin Shah and Shah Rukh Khan (who Dilip Kumar often said was like a son), has acknowledged at some time or the other that they were inspired and influenced by the legendary actor’s school of acting. The list naturally included the young man Dilip Kumar had handpicked to play the hero in Kalinga. One of the fallouts of the Kalinga fiasco was that while it didn’t tar the veteran’s aura, it stymied the career of those who were looking at it as a glorious launch pad. It is believed that Amitoje Mann (now a popular filmmaker in Punjabi and close to today’s farmers’ protests), who was chosen by Dilip Kumar and cast opposite Meenakshi Seshadri in Kalinga, had to turn down offers as substantial as Yash Chopra’s Darr to concentrate on his debut film. Mann’s dreams of stardom died with the shelving of Kalinga but the many years spent as the thespian’s protégé translated into lessons learnt from the living textbook of acting. Mann recalled a scene in Kalinga where Dilip Kumar had to break down on the death of a beloved one. The actor kept postponing its shoot for one reason or the other until he was fully prepped for it. When he finally did it, it was so perfect in its intensity that the youngsters who were hanging on to every word he uttered rushed to the Nagra (sound equipment popular then) to repeatedly hear how he’d delivered his lines. After wrapping up the day’s shoot, Dilip Kumar told Mann that there were many ways to bring a tear to the eye, including glycerine. “Lekin lagna chahiye ki chot lagi hai (The shot should look as though the heart has been pierced),” he explained. He also revealed that before shooting, he had remembered his older sister Aapa who had been like a mother to him. He recalled her death and thus the grief he portrayed had poured forth from deep inside his heart. “Unko yaad karke, bhavuk hoke, phir shot diya” — he remembered his sister, stirred the emotions within him, and then gave his shot. It was a shot only those present were privy to as the audience never got to see it. Even as late as Kalinga, Dilip Kumar’s childlike happiness at having done a powerful day’s work was evident in the car ride back home. It was Dilip Kumar demonstrating his own maxim, “Shauq kabhi nahin haarna (Never let the passion for your art diminish). Otherwise it will be pack-up for you.” It was the passion and the delight he took in his work that saw him through six decades as he got his breakthrough box-office acceptance with Andaaz, co-starring Raj Kapoor and Nargis, in 1949 and sailed through the ’50s with his biggest hits Devdas (1955), Naya Daur (1957) and Madhumati (1958), topping it up with the spectacular Mughal-e-Azam (1960). Gratified with his success and the cinema he was associated with, Dilip Kumar had no twinge of regret turning down even David Lean and his Lawrence of Arabia (1962). The role that gave Omar Sharif his foothold in Hollywood. The one phase where he saw repeated failure came towards the end of his innings as hero with debacles like Dastaan (1972), Sagina (1974) and Bairaag (1976). But he came up trumps again after moving to the pivotal senior slot with many a hit like Kranti (1981), Vidhaata (1982), Karma (1986) and Saudagar (1991). With his mixed bag of roles, the Tragedy King label was restrictive and didn’t quite sum him up. In fact, going by his many dalliances off-screen, the King of Romance would’ve been a more fitting title for him. While he was linked with co-star Kamini Kaushal way back in 1948 (film, Shaheed), it was his dramatic evidence in court against Madhubala, the heroine he was secretly dating, in a case that filmmaker B.R. Chopra had filed against the actress that ended his relationship with his Mughal-e-Azam co-star. Those were colourful times indeed and Dilip Kumar was its centrepiece. After the exit of Madhubala from his life, it was a long stint in Madras that saw him courting Waheeda Rehman quite unabashedly while they filmed Ram Aur Shyam (1967). But when Saira Banu’s mother Naseem Banu, aghast that her daughter was seriously involved with married Hindu Rajendra Kumar, turned to Dilip Kumar for help, he found himself at the altar with Saira as his bride while Waheeda was left high and dry. In 1966, he was 44 years old, his bride was 22. But he wasn’t done with his romances. Thirteen years into the marriage and after Saira and he lost an infant baby (a son who died at birth), he hit the headlines again with a secret marriage to Asma, an attractive Hyderabadi, a married woman with three children. He did the unthinkable in many ways. After vehemently denying the marriage to Asma by swearing on the Quran before Saira, he was caught out when the nikahnama was published in a tabloid. Maharashtra governor Sadiq Ali had appointed Dilip Kumar the sheriff of Bombay in 1980. But the new sheriff was so caught up in the throes of his new passion that soon the paeans of love that he penned for Asma on the mayor’s stationery livened up the front page all over again. Saira ultimately “won” back her husband when Dilip Kumar divorced Asma and she was never heard of again. What was it that earned Dilip Kumar unparalleled respect and admiration despite his dalliances and many misdemeanours? Anil Kapoor once told me, “His achievements far outweigh everything else.” That perhaps explains it as Dilip Kumar was the only actor to be decorated by both India and Pakistan. He was given Pakistan’s highest civilian award, the Nishan-e-Imtiaz, in 1998 and was awarded the Padma Vibhushan by India in 2015. He was also a Rajya Sabha MP, a staunch Congressman till the end. A foodie who relished his kebabs and vada paavs, Dilip Kumar told me at the outdoor shooting of Saudagar that when it came to food, he had “no class, I eat everything”. Erudite with deep knowledge of a variety of subjects including philosophy, theology and poetry, he also knew the intricacies of several sports and played badminton and football. When he was still up and about, he was famous for his late evening walk at Joggers Park in Bandra, togged up in trademark white pants and shirt, sometimes even after closing hours when it would be opened specially for him. The actor also spoke more than a dozen languages. Apart from English, Hindi, Urdu, Pashtu and Gujarati, he spoke Marathi like a native. He shared that with his friend Mukri, the pint-sized comedian who sang the taan in between Dilip Kumar’s Madhuban mein Radhika in Kohinoor (1960). The two actors bantered in Marathi all their lives and when Dilip Kumar heard that Mukri was seriously ailing with gangrene in a Juhu hospital, he made arrangements for him to be shifted in an ambulance to the better-equipped Lilavati Hospital in Bandra, assuring his family that the bill shouldn’t concern them. Daughter Naseem Mukri recalled that while her father was in surgery and she had forgotten to eat all day, a thoughtful Dilip Kumar had personally escorted her to the hospital canteen, sat with her and made her eat. Dilip Kumar was in Delhi when Mukri passed. But he had left his hotline number with Naseem, comforting her that in his absence Saira would be available. When the hospital wanted Rs 1.5 lakh to be paid before releasing Mukri’s body, one call to Saira and Dilip Kumar’s man was there with the cash in 10 minutes. These were gracious acts that Dilip Kumar did quietly, requesting his beneficiaries not to talk about it in public. He got his Twitter account on his 89th birthday in 2011, a handle that has been largely managed by Saira. The Substance and the Shadow, his autobiography, was released in 2014, by which time Dilip Kumar was fast slipping into a world of fading memory and oblivion.

Rajya Sabha member R.C.P. Singh was the only leader from Nitish’s Janata Dal United to be included in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ministry despite senior JDU leaders driving a hard bargain for what sources had claimed were four ministries. Singh, the JDU national president, has been given the steel portfolio. The JDU has this time thought it better to join the Union government in the changed political circumstances in which it is a junior partner with 44 MLAs in Bihar while the BJP with 74 MLAs is in an assertive position in the state for the first time. Although Nitish had stated on Tuesday that cabinet expansion and the number of ministers to be included from an ally were the “prerogatives of the Prime Minister”, the outcome seems to have shaken the JDU at a time it was hoping that the Bengal debacle would have a sobering effect on the BJP. It has also fuelled speculation on why Nitish accepted such a deal when he could have easily kept his party away from participating in the central government, remaining steadfast on the demand for “proportional representation” that he had raised after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The BJP, with a comfortable majority in the Lok Sabha, had offered just one cabinet berth to the JDU as part of the symbolic representation the national party had granted to its allies. Nitish had rebuffed the offer. His party had won 16 of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar while the BJP had clinched 17. “Our intention is that the NDA government runs strongly both at the Centre and in the state,” Singh said on Wednesday, asked about the compulsion to accept a deal previously rejected by the JDU. A senior JDU leader said the meek acceptance of what seemed to be a “BJP-imposed” cabinet expansion had dealt a blow to Nitish and his image. “The acceptance of the formula that he had declined two years ago shows that Nitish has bowed down to the BJP in the changed political circumstances. Whether true or not, this also sends out the message that he has accepted the predicament that he has to save his own position and that he is at the mercy of his ally,” the leader said on the condition of anonymity. Political observers asserted that Nitish opting to make Singh available for inclusion in the Union ministry also showed that he would play backward caste politics to the hilt with special focus on the Kurmi and Kushwaha castes. Nitish and Singh hail from the Kurmi caste. The observers said this might dent Nitish’s image of a politician who took all castes and communities along. Some in the JDU rued that Munger MP and close Nitish aide Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh, who belongs to the upper Bhumihar caste, was not given an opportunity to become a central minister.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-459
08-07-2021||India||Delays, opacity marked Ramesh Pokhriyal's tenure: Academics||Delays, opacity and a U-turn on a policy decision marked the 25-month tenure of Ramesh Pokhriyal, who resigned as Union education minister on Wednesday, academics said. Among the examples they cited were the chronic delays in the appointment of IIT directors and central university vice-chancellors and, consequently, the ad-hoc running of institutions by acting heads, as well as the lack of transparency around selection processes and their cancellations. For instance, the education ministry had on November 26, 2019, advertised the posts of directors for the IITs in Bhubaneswar, Patna and Ropar. The selection processes for all three were carried out simultaneously. On July 14 last year, a panel headed by Pokhriyal held online interviews of the shortlisted candidates. Six months had passed since the interview when IIT Ropar got its new director in January. The other two are still waiting — almost a year on — amid a haze on the fate and progress of the appointment process. “Such delays never happened before at premier institutions like the IITs. The absence of a regular director affects the recruitment of faculty, planning of academic activities amid the pandemic, and development activities,” an IIT Bhubaneswar teacher said. Normally, issuing the appointment letter should not take more than two weeks after the interview, with the education ministry forwarding the names and the President — the Visitor of central universities and the IITs — clearing them promptly. While Pokhriyal must carry the can for the delays, government sources have blamed the Prime Minister’s Office, saying it takes all the decisions. If the selection process fails to find a suitable candidate, the entire exercise has to start again. However, after a Pokhriyal-led committee interviewed would-be directors for the IITs in Mandi and Indore on December 26, 2019, the ministry cancelled the processes only in November 2020. The 11-month delay remains unexplained. Delays in appointments have hamstrung the central universities too. As many as 20 of them are now headed by vice-chancellors-in-charge, among them eminent institutions like Delhi University, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Hyderabad University and Banaras Hindu University. Two senior IIT teachers said the opacity around the appointments of academic heads for the IITs and central universities was discouraging academics of repute and experience from applying. “The performance of an academic institution depends on who is leading it. But well-qualified academics with good personal conduct and leadership skills are not taking an interest because of the opacity of the appointment process,” a senior IIT functionary said. In 2017, the education ministry (then HRD ministry) under Pokhriyal’s predecessor had asked the National Institute of Open Schooling to design an 18-month, distance-learning Diploma in Elementary Education course. The idea was to help the nearly 13 lakh schoolteachers who lacked a degree or diploma in teaching, which the Right to Education Act had made mandatory. But in 2019, the National Council for Teacher Education issued an order, with approval from Pokhriyal’s ministry, saying serving teachers who had earned their diploma through the 18-month course were ineligible from applying for new jobs. Last year, the order was withdrawn under court directions. After the National Education Policy was published in July last year, Pokhriyal’s ministry took 11 months to ask the NCERT to collaborate with its state counterparts and develop National Curriculum Frameworks, the key documents for the preparation of syllabuses and textbooks. “The new textbooks cannot come before the 2024-25 academic session, by when the next government would be in place,” an NCERT official said. In January this year, an email was sent to the education ministry seeking the reasons for the delays in appointments after interviews, and its reactions to the charges of opacity. The email remains unanswered.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-460

Mandaviya, known to be close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Shah, will also handle chemicals and fertilisers. The chemicals ministry is responsible for drug and vaccine manufacturing. Dharmendra Pradhan has been made the new education minister and given additional charge of the skill development ministry. He used to handle the petroleum and steel ministry. Jyotiraditya Scindia, the high-profile defector from the Congress, is the new civil aviation minister, a portfolio his father Madhavrao Scindia once held. Anurag Singh Thakur, a former BCCI president known for chanting the inflammatory “goli maro salon ko (shoot the traitors)” slogan during the Delhi election campaign last year, has been given the key ministries of sports & youth affairs and information & broadcasting. As I&B minister, he will be the official spokesperson for the government. Thakur was a junior finance minister but has been promoted to cabinet rank. Ashwini Vaishnaw, a former IAS officer and technocrat, is the new minister for railways and information technology. The railways portfolio was held by Piyush Goyal, who now has charge of the textile ministry in addition to commerce and consumer affairs. Former Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal is the minister for ports, shipping and waterways besides ayush. Kiren Rijiju is the new law and justice minister, replacing the sacked Ravi Shankar Prasad. Giriraj Singh, a minister known for his communal remarks, has been given the rural development portfolio. Bhupender Yadav, another key entrant, has charge of environment, forests and climate change along with labour, taking over from Prakash Javadekar and Santosh Gangwar, respectively. The two Bihar allies in the cabinet — the JDU’s R.C.P. Singh and the LJP’s Pashupati Paras — have got relatively low-profile ministries, steel and food processing, respectively.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-460
08-07-2021||India||'Fault in engine, bogies changed', Congress quips about Cabinet rejig||The Congress said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his big three — home minister Amit Shah, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and defence minister Rajnath Singh — wouldn’t have survived had performance been the criterion for Wednesday’s cabinet reshuffle. “The fault is in the engine but bogies are being changed,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, referring to the dropping of several ministers. Many senior Congress leaders who have decades of ministerial experience insisted that Modi’s lack of wisdom and “autocratic” style of functioning were at the root of the “disastrous performance” of the government. They said the much-hyped reshuffle was a case of wrong diagnosis followed by wrong medication. Alleging that the exercise was merely an attempt to accommodate defectors and redistribute the spoils of power, Surjewala said: “If performance and governance were the criteria, then the first person to be sacked should be the Prime Minister himself. “He has brought governance and the entire country to a standstill. Progress, peace and harmony have been thrown into the dustbin. The Prime Minister would be remembered as an autocrat who decimated India’s economy, who ensured India was pushed into an abyss of unemployment. Modi undermined India’s potential to become a superpower.” The Congress spokesperson continued: “If performance was the criteria, then defence minister Rajnath Singh, under whose watch China has occupied Indian territory and is refusing to vacate it, should be sacked. “Home minister Amit Shah should be sacked as Naxalism and terrorism are continuing unabated and repression of human rights has become the norm. Custodial death of activists has become the practice. Mob lynching is the new mantra. “Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman should be sacked for destroying the economy. Manmohan Singh had left the GDP growing at almost 8 per cent and now it is minus 8 per cent. She only created unemployment, inflation and deficit. She has no comprehension of the word finance.” The Congress also pointed to agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who has been indifferent to the farmers’ movement in which over 500 peasants have died, and petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan, accusing him of looting the public at a time the prices of petroleum products had shot through the roof. The Congress wasn’t that acerbic about health minister Harsh Vardhan, who was among those who resigned, saying the devastation perpetrated by the pandemic was the result of the lack of vision of the Prime Minister and the home minister. Veteran leader Jairam Ramesh tweeted: “Poor Harsh Vardhan, a good man has been made a scapegoat for the monumental failures at the highest level — nowhere else.” Former finance minister P. Chidambaram said: “The resignation of the Union health minister and the MoS (minister of state) health is a candid confession that the Modi government has utterly failed in managing the pandemic. There is a lesson for ministers in these resignations. “If things go right the credit will go to the Prime Minister, if things go wrong the minister will be the fall guy. That is the price a minister pays for implicit obedience and unquestioning subservience.” Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said: “Ministers should understand that posts and positions come and go. They should never stoop so low as Harsh Vardhan did by writing a nasty letter to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to please Modi. They should understand that bouquets are reserved for Modi and the brickbats will fall on them. The new ministers must not describe day as night in sycophancy and should rather tell the truth before the Prime Minister.” She argued that the much-hyped reshuffle would draw people’s interest only if it helps the government lift the economy, ensure more vaccines, make women safer and generate jobs. While turncoat Jyotiraditya Scindia’s cabinet inclusion was dismissed in one sentence as “adjustment of defectors”, former Congress leader Narayan Rane’s induction generated much curiosity in the party. A senior leader told The Telegraph: “Rane becoming a central minister under Modi is such a relief. It has immense political significance. Rane is Shiv Sena’s pet aversion; this signals the BJP’s readiness to needle the Sena in Mumbai, which Uddhav Thackeray will never digest. Those who had imagined a Sena-BJP patch-up should learn to read messages correctly.” The Congress, which launched a weeklong nationwide protest against the savage hike in petroleum prices, also contested the efficacy of the BJP’s plan to bolster its prospects in election-bound states by inducting leaders from those places. “Performance matters more than symbolism. If Modi thinks promoting a Hardeep Puri will salvage the situation in Punjab, they are naive. People will not forget the shocking misgovernance in Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat only because lots of ministers from these states took oath,” a Congress leader said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-460
08-07-2021||India||Harsh Vardhan pays political price for India’s Covid botch-ups||Harsh Vardhan, the Union health minister in the Narendra Modi cabinet, has paid what some health experts said was the political price for India’s botched responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. Vardhan, an ear-nose-throat surgeon turned politician who resigned hours ahead of the cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday, could have at most only partially influenced those responses but stoutly defended them, exposing himself to criticism, the experts said. In early March, amid a steady rise in daily new Covid-19 cases, Vardhan had said India was in the “endgame” of the pandemic, only eight weeks before the counts spiked 18-fold to reach over 414,000 daily new infections on May 7. In early April, at a time several states were running short of Covid-19 vaccines and many potential recipients were turned away from inoculation centres, Vardhan had claimed that “allegations of vaccine shortage are utterly baseless”, and had attacked states for complaining about scarcity. Sections of experts and analysts on Wednesday said Vardhan would have likely had a limited role in planning details of India’s responses to Covid-19 — whether the harsh lockdown after a four-hour notice last year, poor preparations for the second wave, or the vaccination policy. “Poor Dr Harsh Vardhan. A good man has been made a scapegoat for monumental failures at the highest level — nowhere else,” Congress leader and former Union minister Jairam Ramesh tweeted. The Congress had in April this year described as “vile and pedestrian” a letter Vardhan had written in response to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s suggestions to improve the nation’s Covid-19 responses and scale up the vaccination campaign. “He just did what he was told to do,” Ramesh told The Telegraph on Wednesday. The Centre had in early 2020 established multiple “task forces” and “empowered groups” made up of medical and public health experts and senior administrators to guide the government on its responses to the pandemic and the vaccination policy. “It is obvious Vardhan alone can’t be held responsible, but as the country’s health minister he claimed the end of the pandemic just as the second wave was starting and he also denied vaccine shortages even though the shortages were evident in many states,” said Rijo John, a health economist and adjunct professor at the Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, Kochi. While some analysts view Vardhan’s resignation as a “whitewashing” exercise that will render him a scapegoat, others believe that he played a willing role. A senior doctor guiding the country’s Covid-19 response said: “There is an old quote that says — no one can humiliate you without your consent.” Vardhan had last year claimed credit for initiating screening on international travellers in January 2020, days ahead of the World Health Organisation’s declaration of a public health emergency and had also asserted that India had “done its best” to fight Covid-19. But public health experts say the country’s poor preparedness and planning was evident from the many deaths of patients who could not get beds, oxygen, or appropriate medical care around the peak of the second wave in April and May this year. Vardhan had also drawn criticism in February from the Indian Medical Association, the country’s largest body of doctors. The IMA had accused Vardhan of breaching ethics by appearing at an event where Patanjali Ayurved promoter Ramdev had claimed a herbal cocktail called Coronil was “the first evidence-based medicine for Covid-19”.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-460
08-07-2021||India||Odisha MP takes oath as cabinet minister in the Modi govt||Rajya Sabha MP Ashwini Vaishnaw, who took oath as a cabinet minister in the Narendra Modi government on Wednesday, is believed to be reaping rich rewards for his good equations with the top BJP and BJD leadership. On June 21, 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah had called up Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik, requesting him to lend his support for the election of Ashwini Vaishnaw, former private secretary to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to the Rajya Sabha from Odisha on a BJP ticket. The BJP did not have the requisite numbers in the state Assembly to get the 1994 batch IAS officer from the Odisha cadre elected to the Upper House on its own strength. On the other hand, the Naveen Patnaik-led Biju Janata Dal (BJD) had the strength to get at least three leaders from Odisha to the Rajya Sabha. Following the Prime Minister’s request, the BJD had agreed to support Vaishnaw and ensured his victory. Announcing his support for Vaishnaw, the chief minister had said: “He belongs to the Odisha cadre and has served the state well.” That was Naveen’s way of justifying his party’s support to a BJP candidate at the cost of his own party. Earlier, Naveen had promised to send former Lok Sabha member Prasanna Kumar Patsani, who had been denied a BJD ticket for the Bhubaneswar Lok Sabha seat to accommodate former Mumbai police commissioner Arup Patnaik, to the Rajya Sabha. However, Patnaik was defeated by BJP candidate and former IAS officer (1994 batch) Aparajita Sarangi. “That very day, everyone had a feeling that Vaishnaw will be inducted into the Modi ministry sooner or later. He belongs to Rajasthan and is well-connected with the BJP leadership since his days as private secretary to Vajpayee. We are happy today after Modiji inducted him in the ministry,” a senior BJP leader said on Monday. Speculation was rife that the fear of a CBI probe into the mining scam had forced Naveen to keep the central BJP leadership in good humour. Though the Justice M.B. Shah commission in 2014 had recommended a CBI probe into the alleged mining scam, the NDA government had not favoured it. However, the government could have changed its mind any time. After being nominated to the Rajya Sabha, Vaishnaw maintained a low profile even in Odisha and never attacked the Naveen government like his other party colleagues, including Bhubaneswar MP Sarangi, who was a strong contender for a central ministerial berth. Vaishnaw has, therefore, been rewarded for his good relations with top BJP and BJD leadership and his down-to-earth nature. On the other hand, the BJP has rewarded Mayurbhanj MP Bishweswar Tudu for his organisational skills. It was Tudu who checked the ruling BJD’s ingress into the tribal-dominated Mayurbhanj district. “We had won six seats out of seven Assembly seats in Mayurbhanj. The zilla parishad belongs to the BJP. Besides, he has strong connections with the RSS. He had worked in its Adivasi Kalyana unit for tribal development,” said a BJP leader. “Besides, Draupadi Murmu who belongs to Mayurbhanj was replaced by Ramesh Bais as governor of Jharkhand. Modiji did not want to ignore the district, which has given BJP the maximum number of MLAs in Odisha. Being a tribal also proved to be an asset for Tudu. But Jual Oram, former Union minister and MP from Sundergarh, who is also a big tribal leader, has failed to make a comeback. Modiji has expanded his ministry taking several factors, including the performance of ministers, into account. Perhaps that is why Pratap Sarangi has been shown the door,” said a BJP leader.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-460
08-07-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi meets Bihar leaders, legislators and parliamentarians||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi devoted the day to Bihar, meeting at least 35 leaders, legislators and parliamentarians from the state at his residence in New Delhi on Wednesday, amid speculation about an imminent change of guard. Though several senior leaders maintained that the meeting was to chalk out the future strategy of the Congress in Bihar, the move indicated that the top leadership is likely to crack the whip after the party’s dismal performance in the Assembly polls in October–November last year. The Congress had contested 70 Assembly seats out of 243 in the state as part of the Grand Alliance but won just 19. Its partner Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) had attributed the Congress’s poor performance as the main reason behind the alliance failing to form a government in Bihar. Sources said Rahul’s step was also an effort to keep the Bihar flock united amid allegations and suspicions that chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal United (JDU) and partner BJP were making attempts to engineer a split in the Congress legislature party. Those who met Rahul included state party chief Madan Mohan Jha, former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar, former Kerala governor Nikhil Kumar, former cricketer Kirti Azad, who had quit the BJP to join the Congress ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, and former MP Ranjeet Ranjan, wife of Jan Adhikar Party leader Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav. “The meeting was to discuss how to strengthen the party and its organisation in Bihar. He (Rahul) wanted to know the opinion of the senior leaders from the state on this issue,” Meira told reporters. Meira skirted the issue of any change in the state leadership, but did not deny that it was discussed at the meeting. “I will not be able to say anything about any change,” she said. Jha told The Telegraph that Rahul had convened the meeting “to meet the MLAs and MLCs he had not met till now. They had been asking him for an appointment. A few former state presidents of the party were also present”. The 19 MLAs, four MLCs and two MPs were also among the Bihar leaders who met Rahul. They had a one-on-one meeting with him at which he enquired about the condition of the party and sought their suggestions. “Rahulji asked me who should be made the president of the state unit and sought my preference of the community he should hail from. I gave my suggestions. There is an opinion that the term of the state party president should be for a maximum of three years,” one of the legislators told this newspaper on the condition of anonymity. Another legislator said that apprehensions about a split in the party engineered by the JDU or the BJP were also discussed. The daylong meeting in Delhi was a fallout of the tours by AICC Bihar in-charge Bhakta Charan Das across different parts of Bihar over the last few months. He had faced protests from party workers against alleged stagnancy and poor leadership in the state, as well as growing dissatisfaction and disillusionment among them. Sources said that Rahul was trying to cobble together a leadership that would represent Bihar-specific caste equations and women in a better manner.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-460
08-07-2021||India||Month-long prayers and condolence meetings for Stan Swamy||A month-long series of prayer and condolence meetings will be held in memory of Father Stan Swamy, the 84-year-old undertrial in a terrorism case who died in judicial custody in Mumbai on Monday, after his ashes reach Ranchi on Thursday. A public meeting is expected on Thursday in Bagaicha, a workspace for activists on the outskirts of the Jharkhand capital where the Jesuit priest and tribal rights activist lived. Jerome Cutinha, Provincial of the Jamshedpur Jesuit Province that Fr Stan was part of, told The Telegraph that the large community of Stan’s friends would be given the space to grieve through events to be held over the next one month. “For a month, there would be prayer and condolence meetings that people have voluntarily come forward to organise. These are not specific to any religion, and vigils are already being held in several places,” he said. Condolence meetings have been held in several towns in Jharkhand and other parts of the country, such as Mangalore (Karnataka) which has a large Catholic population. “Villagers around Bagaicha have said they would be coming to pay their respects tomorrow (Thursday), probably around 11am. We are told that many political leaders would also come to pay their respects,” Cutinha said. “Fr Stan’s ashes may be taken to some of these meetings as well as his hometown (Tiruchirapalli) in Tamil Nadu. Nothing is finalised but there is a proposal for a memorial. According to tribal customs, a large stone may be placed over his ashes, (to be) interred at Bagaicha. The ashes may also be buried in our cemetery in Jamshedpur.” More than 24,000 people had on Tuesday viewed online Fr Stan’s funeral mass, during which Cutinha described him as a “martyr”. The Jesuits condemned the ill-treatment the ailing activist faced in Navi Mumbai’s Taloja Central Prison, where he had been held since last October on what they dubbed “fabricated charges”. While the Jesuits have not formally requested Pope Francis, who too was a Jesuit, for Fr Stan to be given the “decree of martyrdom” — an accelerated path to sainthood in the Catholic Church — they are determined to promote his legacy. Stanislaus D’Souza, president of the Jesuit Conference of South Asia, told this newspaper: “Choice has been the defining factor in the life of Stan. He chose Jesus and the poor and completely identified himself with them. Of course, when one makes a choice — and especially a choice for the poor — one is harassed, humiliated and hounded. And that is what exactly happened. “He was charged with crimes which he had never dreamt of. He was imprisoned and, finally, his death was hastened by the rough and brutal treatment he received while in the custody of the State.” He added: “As for the ‘martyr’, we are certainly happy that we are able to produce a great witness to Christian faith and life. He is an example for us to emulate and to make our lives and works more effective.... It is time for us to pray for holy boldness to recommit ourselves to the mission of Jesus: reconciliation and justice. “We know that there are some individual attempts to garner support to make him a ‘martyr’. However, the priority of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) now is to mourn the death of our dear brother and explore possibilities to continue his legacy to work among the poor, especially the indigenous people and Dalits, and their rights.” Fr Stan, whose given name was Stanislaus Lourduswamy, was among 16 people arrested in the Elgar Parishad case, an investigation into alleged Maoist links to an Ambedkarite event on December 31, 2017, that was followed by caste clashes the following day that claimed one life. The case expanded into a purge of “urban Naxals”, a term coined by Right-wing commentators to describe academics, lawyers, litterateurs and activists like Fr Stan who are accused of clandestinely working for the banned CPI (Maoist). The case was transferred from Maharashtra police to the National Investigation Agency soon after the BJP lost power in the western state.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-460
08-07-2021||India||Supreme Court seeks details of RTI panel vacancies||The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted four weeks to the Centre and states to come out with details of vacancies of information commissioners amid complaints that governments across the country are seeking to dilute the transparency law by the keeping the posts vacant. The bench of Justices Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari asked additional solicitor-general Madhavi Divan appearing for the Centre to place on record the updated status report on vacancies in the Central Information Commission (CIC) and State Information Commissions (SIC). The court was hearing a joint PIL filed by RTI activists Anjali Bharadwaj, Col Lokesh Batra and Amrita Johri complaining about the large-scale vacancies resulting in a massive backlog of cases. Appearing for the petitioners, advocate Prashant Bhushan accused the Centre of conducting the appointment process in an opaque manner so that even the leader of the Opposition, who is part of the selection committee headed by the Prime Minister, is not given any details on the criteria for short-listing the names. Bhushan said the vacancies were not confined to the CIC alone but also affected the State Information Commissions of Maharashtra, Odisha, Karnataka and Bengal. Bhushan submitted that despite repeated observations and directions from the apex court against filling up the posts with bureaucrats, the Union government had not made the selection process transparent till date. “They have not placed either the names of the candidates or the selection criteria on record. More than 300 people applied, but they short-listed only seven persons without specifying the criteria for short-listing the names,” he said. According to Bhushan, the Centre was keen on keeping the posts either vacant or filling them up with “party supporters”, thereby destroying the very purpose of the transparency law. The bench had initially granted six weeks to the Centre and states to file their affidavits, but modified the order to four weeks on Bhushan’s insistence. The three activists had in October last year sought an urgent direction to the Centre to fill up the six vacancies in the CIC on account of which over 36,000 complaints/appeals under the Right to Information Act were pending adjudication. It was alleged that the Centre was not taking the necessary steps to fill up the vacancies to frustrate the laudable objective of the RTI Act. It was submitted that out of the sanctioned 11 posts in the CIC, which includes the chief commissioner, only five posts have been filled up. The overall vacancies are pending for the past two years. “Six posts, including that of Chief Commissioner, is vacant as on 15.10.2020: With the retirement of the chief on 26.8.2020 and another commissioner demitting office in the end of September, 2020, currently six posts, including that of the chief are lying vacant and the pendency of appeals/complaints has risen to over 36,600,” the application stated. According to the petitioners, the apex court’s December 16, 2019, order for filling up all the vacancies had not been complied with. “It is further submitted that it appears the UOI (Union of India) is resorting to issuing fresh advertisements instead of filling up all the advertised vacant posts in a bid to cause undue delay in the appointments thereby frustrating people’s right to information,” the application said. It also alleged that the Union government’s affidavit dated April 24, 2020, had falsely claimed that the December 16, 2019, directive of the apex court to fill up all the vacant posts within three months had been complied with. “Even though the respondent UOI failed to comply with the directions dated 16.12.2019 of this Hon’ble Court to complete the appointment process in respect of Information Commissioners in CIC within a period of three months, vide affidavit dated 24.4.2020, the UOI has claimed that ‘the process of appointment in response of Information Commissioners in Central Information Commission has been completed within three months as directed by this Hon’ble Court in its Order dated 16.12.2019.’ “It is submitted that this assertion is patently false and misleading as the respondent was to fill all the vacancies which were advertised on 12.12.2019 and not merely appoint one information commissioner and a Chief. The affidavit notes that 250 applications were received pursuant to the advertisement for 4 posts of information commissioners. However, no reason is given as to why only one vacant post was filled, instead of filling all 4. As of 24.4.2020, the number of vacancies in the CIC persisted at 4,” the application stated.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-460
