The Index for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) evaluates progress of states and union territories on social, economic and environmental parameters. The country's overall SDG score improved by 6 points -- from 60 in 2019 to 66 in 2020-21. This positive stride towards achieving the targets is largely driven by exemplary country-wide performance in clean water and sanitation, and affordable and clean energy, the Niti Aayog said in a statement. Kerala retained its rank as the top state with a score of 75. Both Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu took the second spot with a score of 74. Bihar, Jharkhand and Assam were the worst performing states in this year's index. The third rendition of India's SDG Index was launched by Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar. Further, Chandigarh maintained its top spot among the union territories (UTs) with a score of 79, followed by Delhi (68). Mizoram, Haryana and Uttarakhand were the top gainers in 2020-21 in terms of improvement in score from 2019, with an increase of 12, 10 and 8 points, respectively. While in 2019, 10 states/UTs belonged to the category of front-runners (score in the range 65-99, both inclusive), 12 more states/UTs find themselves in this category in 2020-21. Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Mizoram, Punjab, Haryana, Tripura, Delhi, Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh graduated to the category of front-runners. Under the health sector goals, Gujarat and Delhi were the top performers among the states and the UTs, respectively. Twenty-one states and all UTs bagged a position in the category of front-runners, while no state/UT was in the category of aspirants (with index score less than 50). Under the goal of quality education, Kerala and Chandigarh were the top performers among the states and UTs, respectively. Five states and three UTs bagged a position in the category of front-runners. Under the goal of no poverty, Tamil Nadu and Delhi were the best performers among the states and UTs, respectively. Seventeen states and seven UTs bagged a position in the category of front-runners. Under the goal of reduced inequalities, Meghalaya and Chandigarh (Achiever, with Index score of 100) emerged as the best performers among the states and UTs. Twenty states and six UTs bagged a position in the category of front-runners. However, four states fell behind to the aspirants category. "Our effort of monitoring SDGs through the SDG India Index and Dashboard continues to be widely noticed and applauded around the world. It remains a rare data-driven initiative to rank our states and union territories by computing a composite index on the SDGs," Kumar said. Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said, "The report reflects on the partnerships we have built and strengthened during our SDG efforts. The narrative throws light on how collaborative initiatives can result in better outcomes and greater impacts." On the theme of partnerships, Niti Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul said, "It is clear that by working together we can build a more resilient and sustainable future, where no one is left behind." First launched in December 2018, the index has become the primary tool for monitoring progress on the SDGs in the country and has simultaneously fostered competition among the states and union territories by ranking them on the global goals. The index, developed in collaboration with the United Nations in India, measures the progress at the national and sub-national level in the country's journey towards meeting the global goals and targets. It has been successful as an advocacy tool to propagate the messages of sustainability, resilience and partnerships as well. From covering 13 goals, 39 targets, and 62 indicators in the first edition in 2018-19 to 17 goals, 54 targets and 100 indicators in the second; this third edition of the index covers 17 goals, 70 targets, and 115 indicators. The SDGs, constituted through an unprecedented consultative process, have 17 goals and 169 related targets to be achieved by 2030. The goals are an ambitious commitment by world leaders which set out a universal and an unprecedented agenda which embraces economic, environmental and social aspects of the wellbeing of societies.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-90

With people expressing their indignation and leaders cutting across party lines slamming Google, it quickly removed Kannada "as the ugliest language in India" and apologised to the people saying the search result did not reflect its opinion. Karnataka Minister for Kannada, Culture and Forest, Aravind Limbavali told reporters that a legal notice would be served to Google for showing such an answer to that question. Later, he took to Twitter to express his outrage and demanded an apology from Google to Kannada and Kannadigas. Kannada language has a history of its own, having come into existence as many as 2,500 years ago, the minister said and added that the language has been the pride of Kannadigas through the ages. Showing Kannada in poor light "...is merely an attempt by Google to insult this pride of Kannadigas. I demand an apology from @Google ASAP to Kannada, Kannadigas. Legal action will be taken against Google for maligning the image of our beautiful language!" Limbavali tweeted. When contacted, a Google spokesperson said, "Search isn't always perfect. Sometimes, the way content is described on the internet can yield surprising results to specific queries." "We know this is not ideal, but we take swift corrective action when we are made aware of an issue and are continually working to improve our algorithms. Naturally, these are not reflective of the opinions of Google, and we apologise for the misunderstanding and hurting any sentiments." Former Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy denounced Google in a series of tweets for the outrageous answer to the language question. He sought to know why Google "behaves in an irresponsible manner" in terms of language. Others including the BJP's Bengaluru Central MP, P C Mohan slammed Google and asked it to apologise. Sharing the screenshot of the search on his Twitter handle, Mohan said Karnataka is home to the great Vijayanagara empire and the Kannada language has a rich heritage, a glorious legacy and a unique culture. "One of the worlds oldest languages, Kannada had great scholars who wrote epics much before Geoffrey Chaucer was born in the 14th century. Apologise @GoogleIndia."||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-90

Relaxation of restrictions as per the situation in different areas is only under consideration and no decision has been taken, a statement from the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) said. Wadettiwar, minister for Disaster Management, later said only "in principle" approval to phasing out of restrictions was given, but no decision has been taken. He had told reporters in the afternoon that restrictions would be lifted in 18 out of 36 districts in the state where the positivity rate is five per cent or less and the occupancy of oxygen beds in hospitals is less than 25 percent from Friday. He had held a press conference after a meeting of the State Disaster Management Authority in Mumbai. The CMO statement that followed said the government has not lifted lockdown-like curbs as Covid-19 has not been controlled completely yet. "The coronavirus spread is serious in some rural areas....The curbs have not been completely lifted in the state," the statement added. Last week the government had announced that the restrictions, imposed in April this year, would continue till June 15. The CMO statement said that the Disaster Management department has decided five levels of severity of the pandemic based on the positivity rate and availability of oxygen beds. The degree of relaxation will be decided as per the level of severity and guidelines on whether to relax the curbs or further strengthen them will be announced soon, the CMO said. After the CMO issued the clarification, Wadettiwar told reporters that "in principle approval was given to phased lifting of lockdown curbs on the basis of positivity rate and availability of oxygen beds", but no final decision was taken. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar were present at the meeting, he added. "No `unlock' is happening in the state. Even though in principle approval has been given, final decision will be taken by the chief minister," the Congress leader said. Maharashtra had on Wednesday recorded 15,169 new Covid-19 cases and 285 deaths.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-90

The high court deprecated the manner in which a huge quantity of the drug was procured and said genuine patients who needed the medicine at that particular time could not get it as the bulk stock was taken away by cricketer-turned-politician Gambhir. “This was certainly not the way. In this pandemic, it should not be done just because people have means to do it. It should not be that I will do it for one class or for my constituency people and it should not be for popularity. “Firstly, you do charity for charity. Doing charity for some other reason is no charity. We want to curb this practice and for this, we want you (drug controller) to take action,” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said. The drug controller also submitted that action will be taken without delay against the foundation, drug dealers as also in other such cases which would be brought to its notice. AAP MLA Praveen Kumar has also been found guilty for similar offences under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and action will also be taken against him, the court was informed. The counsel for the drug controller also said that show cause notices have been issued to licensees under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act as well as those who were found to have breached the law and their responses are awaited. The court asked the drug controller to file status reports on further progress in these cases within six weeks and listed the matter for hearing on July 29. The high court was hearing a PIL seeking lodging of an FIR on the allegations that politicians are able to procure and distribute in huge quantities the Covid-19 medicines even as patients were running from pillar to post to get them. An application was also filed in the pending petition making allegations against Kumar. The bench said, “We are again mentioning that Gambhir did it with a good intention and has also spent a lot of money and procured the medicines in a public spirit but at what cost?” He did a lot of charity no doubt but he caused a lot of shortage of the drug and inconvenience to the patients, it said. Regarding individuals who had to purchase medicines or oxygen cylinders or concentrators in black market at exorbitant rates, the bench said it does not want to go after them even though it constitutes an offence as people were driven to breach the law due to unavailability of resources. “We are of the view that looking into the acute shortage of medical oxygen during the current wave of the pandemic and acute shortage of oxygen beds in hospitals, though procurement of medical oxygen cylinders for personal use would also tantamount to breach of law, such cases need not be pursued and the endeavour of the drug controller should be on such violators whose actions resulted in choking of the system, including medical oxygen, for bona fide use in the treatment of Covid-19,” the bench said. The court, which on earlier occasions had pulled up the drug controller for not conducting a proper enquiry as to how Gambhir got the huge quantities of Fabiflu, said it is good that this aspect has been now enquired. “Whatever breach has been done under the Act, you are bound to take action and continue the inquiry. Everyone should be painted in the same colour and adopt the same yardstick for everyone,” the bench said, asking the drug controller to also examine other instances and take action. The court was told that in the recent past Gambhir and Kumar were questioned and also the dealers who had sold an oxygen cylinder to unlicensed firm GGF. It is established that GGF do not hold a requisite drug licence for purchase or stock or distribute drugs. It has been found that GGF was unauthorisedly procuring, stocking and distributing drug Fabiflu under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act in a manner which was not permissible under the law. GGF has committed an offence punishable under the Act, advocate Nandita Rao, representing the drug controller, said while reading out the status report. The court had earlier said that the drug controller cannot take it for a ride if it thought that the court was so gullible, so naive, it was not. The court had taken strong exception to the drug controller's report, which concluded that the dealers had ample stock to supply to others, and said everyone knows that the medicine was in short supply and while Gambhir bought thousands of strips of the medicine, other people who needed it could not get it on that day. It had questioned how could such a large stock of drug, that is, 2,628 strips of Fabiflu be given to a foundation which was neither a medical practitioner nor has a licence.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-90

"He (Choksi) is currently in the custody of Dominica where some legal proceedings are underway. We will continue to ensure that he is brought back to India," MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told reporters here at an online press briefing. He was replying to a batch of questions regarding Choksi, who had fled to Antigua but was recently found in Dominica. To another question regarding Palestine foreign minister Riad Malki writing to Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to protest against India's decision to abstain from voting at UNHRC on Gaza violence, the MEA spokesperson said the position that India took was not new and the country has abstained on the previous occasions also. He also said Palestine has written similar letters to all countries that abstained. Palestine has called out India’s abstention during the vote on the resolution, “Ensuring respect for international human rights law and humanitarian law in Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel”, at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva last week. In the letter to the external affairs minister, S. Jaishankar, the Palestinian foreign minister, Riad Malki, said: “Republic of India missed an opportunity to join the international community at this turning point, both crucial and long overdue, on the path to accountability, justice and peace”.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-90

The state, which remains worst-hit by Covid-19, has decided to implement a five-level unlock process as cases have started to come down. Disaster ManagementMinister Vijay Wadettiwar made the announcement after a meeting of the State Disaster Management Authority here on Thursday. The lockdown-like restrictions, imposed in April this year when the second wave of the pandemic intensified, would be lifted in 18 districts where the positivity rate is 5 percent or less and the occupancy of oxygen beds in hospitals is less than 25 percent, he said. These districts have been categorised as Level-1 districts. These 18 districts are Aurangabad, Bhandara, Buldhana, Chandrapur, Dhule, Gadchiroli, Gondia, Jalgaon, Jalna, Latur, Nagpur, Nanded, Nashik, Yavatmal, Washim, Wardha, Parbhani and Thane. All restrictions would be lifted in these districts, he said. Restrictions in Mumbai would be relaxed partially, but the travel by local trains, the state capital's lifeline, would not be open to the general public as of now, the minister said. Mumbai has been categorised as a Level-2 district. The government on Sunday had allowed essential shops to remain open in Mumbai and in districts that had less than 10 per cent Covid positivity rate and where occupancy of oxygen beds was less than 40 per cent, as per a report by ndtv.com. Maharashtra on Wednesday recorded 15,169 new Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 57,76,184, and 285 fresh deaths and also added 268 previously unreported fatalities, the state health department said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-90
03-06-2021||India||Southwest Monsoon makes onset over Kerala||After a delay of two days, the Southwest Monsoon made an onset over Kerala on Thursday, marking the commencement of the four-month rainfall season in the country, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. The Southwest Monsoon has made an onset over southern parts of Kerala, said IMD Director General Mrutunjay Mohapatra. The normal onset date for Southwest Monsoon over Kerala is June 1. Southwest Monsoon is likely to advance into remaining parts of south Arabian Sea and some parts of central Arabian Sea, remaining parts of Kerala, Lakshadweep, some parts of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, coastal and south interior Karnataka, Rayalaseema, and south and central Bay of Bengal during the next two days, the IMD said. This is the third time in the last six years that monsoon arrived late. In 2016 and 2019, Southwest Monsoon made an onset over Kerala on June 8. The IMD had earlier forecast that monsoon would make an onset over Kerala around May 31. Skymet, a private weather forecasting station, said Southwest Monsoon made an onset over Kerala on May 30. However, the IMD said conditions were not ripe for declaring the onset of monsoon. According to IMD, three parameters need to fulfilled for declaring the onset of the Southwest Monsoon over Kerala -- If after May 10, 60 per cent of the 14 stations including Minicoy, Amini, Thiruvananthapuram, Punalur, Kollam, Allapuzha, Kottayam, Kochi, Thrissur, Kozhikode, Thalassery, Kannur, Kudulu and Mangalore report rainfall of 2.5 millimetres or more for two consecutive days, the onset over Kerala can be declared on the second day, provided other two criteria are also in concurrence. This has to be supplemented by the wind speed. The depth of westerlies should be maintained up to 600 hectopascal (hPa), in the box equator to Latitude 10-degrees north and Longitude 55 degrees to 80-degrees east. The zonal wind speed over the area bounded by Latitude 5 to 10-degrees north, Longitude 70-80-degrees east should be of the order of 15-20 knots at 925 hPa, the IMD said. The Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) should be below 200 watt per square meter (wm-2) in the box confined by Latitude 5-10 degrees north and Longitude 70-75 degrees east, it added. The IMD said these parameters were fulfilled on Thursday, it said. The Southwest Monsoon is likely to be normal in north and south India, above-normal in central India and below-normal in east and northeast India, the Met department had said in its second-long range forecast for Southwest Monsoon 2021 on Tuesday. A good monsoon is critical to the Indian economy which is still largely based on agriculture and its allied activities. Most parts of the country are expected to receive normal to above normal rainfall during the season, the IMD said. However, there are some regions in east and northeast India like eastern parts of Bihar, some parts of West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, adjoining Himachal Pradesh, southwest peninsular India, specifically some parts of Kerala, coastal Karnataka and parts of interior Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu where the probability of below normal activity is predicted, the IMD said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-90

Modi said sports is at the heart of our national character and that our youths are creating a strong and vibrant culture of sports, adding that he would be connecting with India's Olympics contingent through a video conference in July to encourage them and wish them on behalf of all Indians, according to a statement. He said wishes of 135 crore Indians will be with our youngsters participating in the Olympics, noting that for every sportsperson shining on the global stage, a thousand more will be inspired to take up sports. Modi was briefed that a total of 100 athletes have qualified for Tokyo Olympics across 11 sports disciplines and about 25 more athletes are likely to qualify, the PMO statement said. While a total of 19 Indian athletes had participated at the last paralympics in 2016 at Rio de Janeiro, 26 para athletes have qualified and 16 more are likely to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics, it said. Officials said special attention will also be given towards motivating athletes and boosting their morale while they participate in the Olympics. Therefore, regular video conferences will be organised with their parents and family members back in India through the course of the competition, they said. Tokyo Olympics is scheduled to begin from July 23. In the review meeting, a presentation was made by officials on various aspects of operational readiness for the upcoming games. Modi was apprised about various steps taken towards ensuring uninterrupted training for athletes amid the pandemic, participation in international competitions to win Olympic quota, vaccination of athletes, and customised support being provided to them. He directed that every qualified and probable athlete, support staff and officials travelling to the Tokyo for the mega sporting event must be vaccinated as soon as possible.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-90
03-06-2021||India||Delhi HC raps doctors’ association over petition against Ramdev’s comments||The Delhi High Court Thursday issued summons to yoga guru Ramdev on a plea accusing him of making statements against allopathic medicines and claiming Patanjali's Coronil kit is a cure for Covid-19 but refused to restrain him at this stage saying the allopathic profession was not so fragile. The high court however orally asked Ramdev's counsel to tell him not to make any provocative statements. "Mr Rajiv Nayar is a very respectable senior (advocate). I am sure his client will listen to him," Justice C Hari Shankar said. The high court issued summons to Ramdev on the suit filed by Delhi Medical Association (DMA) and asked him to file a response in three weeks and listed the matter for hearing on July 13. “Considerable time has passed since the passing of allegedly injurious statements. The counsel says defendant no. 1 (Ramdev) continues to make statements. No injunctive order can be given without giving an opportunity to the plaintiff, especially in view of the objections. Issue summons on the suit,” Justice Shankar said. The court also issued summons to social media platforms Twitter and Facebook and Astha channel, who are made parties to the petition. DMA, on behalf of its doctor members, submitted before the court that Ramdev's statement affects as Coronil medicine does not cure coronavirus and it is misleading. It has claimed a token damage of Rs 1 from him. On being asked by the court as to how did this statement affect the association, senior advocate Rajiv Dutta, representing DMA, said it affects because this medicine does not cure coronavirus and this was a suit for civil rights of doctors. The court said it cannot say as to whether Coronil is a cure or not and that it was something to be decided by medical experts. The judge said he was "least concerned" with the association's argument that Ramdev was a powerful person having a large number of followers. “Ramdev is a person who doesn't have faith in allopathy. He believes everything can be cured by Yoga and Ayurveda. He may be right or wrong," he said. He added, “The court can understand it is argued his statements are affecting the public but here you say oh my God Ramdev has done something. You people should be spending time to find a cure for the pandemic instead of wasting the court's time.” On the point of locus of DMA to file the suit, Dutta said it was affecting the public and also the members of the association as the statements made in open affects and that Ramdev was calling this science fake. To this, the judge said, “If I feel some science is fake. Tomorrow I will feel homeopathy is fake. Do you mean they will file a suit against me? I put it on twitter. You will say take down the Twitter account. It is a public opinion. I do not think your allopathic profession is so fragile,” and added that it has to be tested on the touchstone of free speech. The court said someone has a view that it is because of inefficacy of allopathic medicines that so many people have died and it was of the view that it comes under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. Senior advocate Rajiv Nayar, representing Ramdev, raised preliminary objection on the maintainability of the plea and argued that prima facie the suit was not maintainable as they are asking for an injunction and raising the ground of public good. Dutta also said that Ayush Ministry had made a statement that Coronil was not a cure for Covid-19 and could not be advertised as such and had also asked Patanjali to give details after which Ramdev had clarified that it was an immunity booster. The court noted that Ramdev has clarified and said with this clarification the entire grievance of DMA should have gone. If this was mandatory on Patanjali (to give details and not to advertise) and if he acts in violation, it is for the Ayush Ministry to look into, Why are you carrying the torch, the court said. DMA's counsel further claimed that Patanjali had made Rs 25 crore from Coronil sales, after it was touted as a cure for Covid-19 and that he has a vast following in the country. The court said, "Is he to be blamed for people buying Coronil?" and suggested the association to file a public interest litigation instead of pursuing the suit.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-91

The court also noted that in a patriarchal society, it is fairly common to cast aspersions on the moral character of a woman and more often than not these allegations are made without any basis. The order came following a habeas corpus petition filed by a woman from Punjab's Fatehgarh Sahib district, seeking custody of her four-and half-year-old daughter from her estranged husband who is an Australian citizen. Justice Anupinder Singh Grewal, while allowing the petition of the woman, directed that the custody of the girl be handed over to her mother who is presently residing in Australia. The petitioner's estranged husband had alleged that the woman was in an extra-marital relationship with a relative. “Aside from the bold assertion in the petition, no supporting material has been brought before this court. It would be worthwhile to note that in a patriarchal society, it is fairly common to cast aspersions on the moral character of a woman. More often than not these allegations are made without any basis or foundation," the court said. "Even assuming a woman is or has been in an extramarital relationship, the same by itself cannot lead to the conclusion that she would not be a good mother to deny her the custody of her child,” said the judge in a May 10 order. However, in this case, these allegations against the petitioner being wholly unsubstantiated are not considered relevant to adjudicate the issue of custody of the minor child, as per the order. “The child would require love, care and affection of the mother for her development in the formative years. The support and guidance of the mother would also be imperative during adolescence. The mother is the natural guardian of the child till the age of five years in terms of Section 6 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956,” the judge wrote in his order. In the petition, the woman had submitted that she had got married in 2013. Her husband was an Australian citizen and she later joined him in Australia. The couple had a daughter in June 2017. They later developed matrimonial differences. The petitioner had alleged that when they arrived in India in January 2020, her husband took away their daughter. The father of child contended that the minor was residing with him and his parents in a cordial family environment for almost a year and the change of custody at this stage would not be in the interest of the child especially when the petitioner was living alone and thus, would not be in a position to take care of the child.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-91
03-06-2021||India||Will continue to send reminders to accept privacy policy: WhatsApp||WhatsApp on Thursday said it will not limit the functionality of the messaging app for users not agreeing to its new privacy policy, but will continue to send reminders about the update. WhatsApp said its recent policy update does not change the privacy of people's personal messages, and it has already written to the government seeking to assure them that the privacy of users remains its highest priority. On Thursday, the Centre has told the Delhi High Court that the messaging platform was trying to "force" its users to consent to the new privacy policy before the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill becomes the law by bombarding them with notifications daily to obtain their consent. "We reiterate that we have already responded to the Government of India and assured them that the privacy of users remains our highest priority, a WhatsApp spokesperson said in an emailed statement. A raging debate had ensued earlier this year after WhatsApp said it will update its terms of service and privacy policy around how it processes user data and partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the social media giant's products. The Facebook-owned company has insisted that its contentious privacy policy will not limit the functionality of how WhatsApp works in the coming weeks. Instead, we will continue to remind users from time to time about the update as well as when people choose to use relevant optional features, like communicating with a business that is receiving support from Facebook, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson further noted that the recent update does not change the privacy of people's personal messages and that its purpose is to provide additional information about how people can interact with businesses if they choose to do so. We hope this approach reinforces the choice that all users have whether or not they want to interact with a business. We will maintain this approach until at least the forthcoming PDP law comes into effect, the spokesperson said. Terming WhatsApp's bombarding of notifications on its customers as an "anti-user practice" for obtaining "trick consent", the central government on Thursday urged the court to direct the messaging platform to desist from pushing notifications onto its existing users with regard to the new privacy policy. The Centre's claim has been made in an additional affidavit filed in response to several pleas challenging the new privacy policy of WhatsApp. WhatsApp -- which has 53 crore users in India as per the government data -- had faced severe backlash over user concerns that data was being shared with parent company Facebook. Interestingly, the new rules for social media companies have also come into effect from the last month that mandate large platforms like Facebook and Twitter to undertake greater due diligence and make these digital platforms more accountable and responsible for the content hosted by them. The rules also require significant social media intermediaries - providing services primarily in the nature of messaging - to enable identification of the "first originator" of the information that undermines the sovereignty of India, the security of the state, or public order. This could have major ramifications for players like Twitter and WhatsApp. The new IT rules require significant social media intermediaries - those with other 50 lakh users - to appoint a grievance officer, nodal officer and a chief compliance officer. These personnel are required to be resident in India. Under the new rules, social media companies will have to take down flagged content within 36 hours, and remove within 24 hours content that is flagged for nudity, pornography etc. The Centre had said the new rules are designed to prevent abuse and misuse of platforms, and offer users a robust forum for grievance redressal. Non-compliance with the rules would result in these platforms losing their intermediary status that provides them immunity from liabilities over any third-party data hosted by them. In other words, they could be liable for criminal action in case of complaints.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-91
03-06-2021||India||Teachers Eligibility Test certificate validity extended from 7 years to lifetime||The validity of the Teachers Eligibility Test (TET) qualifying certificates has been extended from seven years to lifetime, Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal "Nishank" announced on Thursday. "The government has decided to extend the validity period of the Teachers Eligibility Test qualifying certificates from seven years to lifetime with a retrospective effect from 2011," the minister said in a statement. "The respective state governments and UTs will take necessary action to revalidate and issue fresh TET certificates to those candidates whose period of seven years has already lapsed," he added. Pokhriyal said this will be a positive step to boost employment opportunities for the candidates aspiring to make a career in the field of teaching. "This will be a positive step in increasing the employment opportunities for candidates aspiring to make a career in the teaching field," he said. Possessing the TET qualifying certificate is one of the essential qualifications for a person to be eligible for appointment as a school teacher. The guidelines dated February 11, 2011 of the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) laid down that TET would be conducted by the state governments and the validity of the TET certificates was seven years from the date of passing TET.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-91
03-06-2021||India||India under Modi successfully fought Covid battle, says Shah||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday said India under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi successfully fought the battle against COVID-19 and managed to bring disease curve down with the help of 135 crore citizens. "Now, the cases are dipping, the number of patients is decreasing. The oxygen requirement has come down to 3,500 MT from 10,000 MT. This indicates that the COVID-19 curve is going down," Shah said. He also said the speed of India's vaccination drive is the fastest in the world and it will further gain momentum in future to cover maximum number of people in the shortest possible time, as envisioned by the PM. Shah was speaking via video conference after virtually inaugurating nine medical oxygen plants set up at government- run hospitals in different parts of Gujarat. The plants have been set up by an NGO - Vallabh Youth Organisation - at government-run hospitals in Tilakvada, Sagbara, Ahmedabad (Sola civil), Daskroi in Ahmedabad district, Kalavad, Kapadvanj, Bhanwad, Mehsana and Porbandar. Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani joined the virtual event from Gandhinagar. Shah said the government succeeded in controlling the spread of the virus and bringing the curve down through collective efforts. "As you might have seen in media (reports), even highly developed countries struggled to tackle the pandemic. On the other side, we fought the battle with patience and planning," he said. He said in other countries, only governments were fighting against the coronavirus. "In India, along with the government, 135 crore citizens also fought this battle under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. This is the reason for our success," said Shah. He paid tributes to all those who lost their lives due to the coronavirus. The minister also thanked frontline workers, doctors, nurses, NGOs and volunteers for helping the people in their hour of need. "Non-governmental organisations helped people in all possible ways. When migrants were going back home (last year), NGOs provided them food, water, shelter and helped them reach their destinations. The government could not have done it all alone," he said. As the new COVID-19 cases (per day) are coming down, Shah said the demand for medical oxygen is also decreasing. As against the daily demand of 1,000 metric tonnes of oxygen in the country earlier, the demand suddenly shot up to 10,000 MT during the second wave of COVID-19, he said. Currently, the demand stands at 3,500 MT, he added. The Centre pressed into service trains and defence aircraft to transport medical oxygen and cryogenic tankers across the country to save the lives of COVID-19 patients when the demand for the life-saving gas was very high, he noted. "While 15,000 MT of oxygen was transported through trains, cryogenic tankers for oxygen storage were transported using Army aircraft," he said. Shah further said that while 162 PSA oxygen plants were approved under the PM Cares Fund after the first wave of COVID-19, another 1,051 were approved this year. Centre purchased one lakh oxygen concentrators through the PM Cares Fund, he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-91

Terming WhatsApp's bombarding of notifications on its customers as an "anti-user practice" for obtaining "trick consent", the central government has urged the court to direct the messaging platform to desist from pushing notifications onto its existing users with regard to the new privacy policy. The Centre's claim has been made in an additional affidavit filed in response to several pleas challenging the new privacy policy of WhatsApp. One of the pleas, which was the first one to be filed, was moved by Chaitanya Rohilla, a lawyer, in January this year. Rohilla, represented by advocate Manohar Lal, has contended that the updated privacy policy violates users' right to privacy under the Constitution and they can either accept it or exit the app, but they cannot opt not to share their data with other Facebook-owned or third party apps. The plea has claimed that the new privacy policy of WhatsApp allows full access into a user's online activity without there being any supervision by the government. In its additional affidavit, which supports the petitioners claims, the Centre has said the privacy policy violates the rules as it fails to specify types of sensitive personal data being collected and also fails to notify users about details of the sensitive personal information which is collected. Besides, the policy also does not provide an option to users to review or amend the information, does not provide an option to withdraw consent retrospectively and also fails to guarantee further nondisclosure by third parties, the affidavit has said. It has also stated that WhatsApp was "indulging in anti-users practices by obtaining 'trick consent' from the users for its updated privacy policy". "It is submitted that millions of WhatsApp existing users, those who have not accepted the updated 2021 privacy policy are being bombarded with notifications on an everyday basis," it has said. The government has said that WhatsApp "has unleashed its digital prowess to the unsuspecting existing users and would like to force them to accept the updated 2021 privacy policy by flashing such notifications at a regular intervals". "The game plan is very clear, i.e., to transfer the entire existing user base committed to the updated 2021 privacy policy before the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill becomes the law," the government has said in its affidavit. The government has sought directions to WhatsApp to place on record the number of times such notifications have been sent out till date on daily basis and what was the conversion rate -- that is how many have accepted the updated 2021 privacy policy vis-a-vis the number of notifications. The central government has further said that WhatsApp "is currently having access to personal, sensitive and business data of hundreds of millions of Indian users and has also acquired role of an 'essential digital service' during Covid-19 pandemic", and thus, it was imperative that it privacy policy and terms of service "should be examined on the touchstone of privacy principles as laid down in K S Puttaswamy" judgement of the Supreme Court.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-91
03-06-2021||India||Centre to procure 30 crore doses of second made-in-India vaccine||The Union Health Ministry has finalised arrangements with Hyderabad-based vaccine manufacturer Biological-E to reserve 30 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses for which it will be making an advance payment of Rs 1,500 crore. These vaccine doses will be manufactured and stockpiled by Biological-E from August to December this year, a ministry statement said on Thursday. The Covid-19 vaccine of Biological-E is currently undergoing phase-3 clinical trials after showing promising results in phase 1 and 2 trials. The vaccine being developed by Biological-E is a RBD protein sub-unit vaccine and is likely to be available in the next few months. The proposal of Biological-E was examined and recommended for approval after due diligence by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC), the statement said. The arrangement with Biological-E is part of the wider endeavour of the Centre to encourage indigenous vaccine manufacturers by providing them support in research and development and also financial support, it said. The Biological-E Covid vaccine candidate has been supported by the Centre from preclinical stage to phase-3 studies. The Department of Biotechnology has not only provided financial assistance in terms of grant-in-aid of over Rs 100 crore but has also partnered with Biological-E to conduct all animal challenge and assay studies through its Research Institute Translational Health Science Technology Institute (THSTI), Faridabad. This has been undertaken as part of the government's 'Mission Covid Suraksha, the Indian Covid-19 Vaccine Development Mission,' which was launched to reinforce and accelerate Covid-19 vaccine development efforts as part of the third stimulus package, Atmanirbhar 3.0, the statement said. The mission aims to bring to the citizens a safe, efficacious, affordable and accessible Covid-19 vaccine. The mission is supporting development of 5-6 Covid-19 vaccine candidates. Some of these are now closer to licensure and introduction in public health systems. It has not just accelerated Covid-19 vaccine development efforts, but also fostered a robust end-to-end vaccine development ecosystem in the country that will be available for other ongoing and future research and developmental activities for other vaccines.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-91

The Pune-based firm has also sought approval for test analysis and examination. Russia's Sputnik V vaccine is currently being manufactured in India by Dr Reddy's Laboratories. "The Serum Institute of India (SII) put up an application to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on Wednesday seeking permission to manufacture the Covid-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, in India," a source said. The SII has already told the government that it will be able to manufacture and supply 10 crore Covishield doses in June, while it is also manufacturing the Novavax vaccine, the regulatory clearance for which is awaited from the United States. The vaccine was given emergency use authorisation (EUA) by the DCGI in April. A consignment of 30 lakh doses of Sputnik V landed in Hyderabad on Tuesday. Dr Reddy's Laboratories is currently in a pact with Russian Direct Investment Fund to sell the first 125 million people doses (250 million vials) of Sputnik V in India. Dr Reddy's Laboratories has received approval from the Indian drug regulator for restricted emergency use of Sputnik V. Dr Reddys, which had earlier received over two lakh vaccines from RDIF, recently soft-launched Sputnik V and tied up with Apollo Hospitals for piloting the vaccine.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-91
03-06-2021||India||SC happy with govt's decision to cancel board exams||The Supreme Court on Thursday said that it is happy to note that the government has taken a decision to cancel the class 12 board exams, and directed the CBSE and CICSE to place on record objective criteria for assessment of marks in two weeks. A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari asked Attorney General K K Venugopal and advocate JK Das, appearing for the CISCE to place on record the parameters in two weeks. "We are happy to note that government has taken decision to cancel class 12 board exams but we want that the objective criteria fixed for assessment of marks be placed before us," the bench said. The bench clarified that it will not give more time for placement of objective criteria as many students will be taking admissions in colleges in India and abroad. The top court said that it will go through the objective parameters for assessment of marks, so that if any one has any objections it can be dealt with. This is equally important as the relief sought by the petitioners seeking cancellation of board exams, the bench observed. The government on Tuesday decided to cancel the CBSE Class 12 board exams amid the COVID-19 pandemic with Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserting that the decision has been taken in the interest of students and that the anxiety among students, parents and teachers must be put to an end. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Modi in which it was decided that the CBSE will take steps to compile the results of class 12 students as per a well-defined objective criteria in a time-bound manner.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-91

The death toll due to the viral disease has climbed to 3,37,989 with 2,887 more people succumbing to it, while the number of active COVID-19 cases was recorded below 20 lakh for the third consecutive day, according to the ministry's data updated at 8 am. Also, 21,59,873 tests were conducted on Wednesday to detect COVID-19, taking the total number of such tests conducted so far in the country to 35,37,82,648, while the daily positivity was recorded at 6.21 per cent. It has been less than 10 per cent for 10 consecutive days now, the ministry said. The weekly positivity rate has declined to 7.66 per cent. The number of active cases has reduced to 17,13,413, accounting for 6.02 per cent of the total number of cases, while the national COVID-19 recovery rate has improved to 92.79 per cent. A net decline of 80,232 cases was recorded in the COVID-19 caseload in a span of 24 hours, the ministry said. Recoveries continued to outnumber the fresh cases for the 21st day in a row. While the case fatality rate has gone up to 1.19 per cent, the data showed. India's COVID-19 tally had crossed the 20-lakh mark on August 7 last year, the 30-lakh mark on August 23, the 40-lakh mark on September 5 and the 50-lakh mark on September 16. It went past 60 lakh on September 28 last year, 70 lakh on October 11, 80 lakh on October 29, 90 lakh on November 20 and the one-crore mark on December 19. The country crossed the grim milestone of two crore coronavirus cases on May 4 this year. The 2,887 fresh fatalities include 553 from Maharashtra, 483 from Tamil Nadu, 463 from Karnataka, 213 from Kerala, 135 from West Bengal, 115 from Uttar Pradesh and 103 from Delhi.

03-06-2021||India||SC quashes FIR against Vinod Dua for sedition over his YouTube show||The Supreme Court on Thursday quashed a sedition case against veteran scribe Vinod Dua for his alleged comments against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his YouTube show last year, saying a 1962 verdict entitles every journalist to protection. A bench comprising Justices U U Lalit and Vineet Saran, however, declined the prayer of Dua that no FIR should be registered against any media personnel with 10 years' experience unless cleared by a committee, saying it would amount to an encroachment into the domain of the executive. On the issue of protection of freedom of speech and expression of media personnel, it said, Every journalist is entitled to protection under the Kedar Nath Singh judgment (the famous verdict of 1962 on the scope and ambit of offence of sedition in the IPC)." While upholding validity of section 124A (sedition) of the IPC, the top court in 1962 had ruled the sedition charges could not be invoked against a citizen for criticism of government actions as it would be in conformity with the freedom of speech and expression. The bench on October 6 last year had reserved the verdict on the petition after hearing arguments for Dua, the Himachal Pradesh government and the complainant, a local BJP leader, in the case. On July 20 last year, the top court had extended till further orders the protection granted to Dua from any coercive action in the case. The top court had earlier said that Dua need not answer any other supplementary questions asked by the Himachal Pradesh police in connection with the case. An FIR against Dua under provisions of the Indian Penal Code for alleged offences of sedition, public nuisance, printing defamatory materials and public mischief was lodged by BJP leader Shyam at Kumarsain police station in Shimla district on May 6 last year and the journalist was asked to join the probe. Shyam has alleged that Dua, in his YouTube show, had made certain allegations against the prime minister. Earlier, in an unprecedented hearing conducted on a Sunday on June 14 last year, the top court had granted protection from arrest to Dua till further orders. However, it had refused to stay the ongoing probe against him. Besides seeking quashing of the FIR, Dua, in the plea, has sought "exemplary damages" for "harassment". He has also sought direction from the apex court that "henceforth FIRs against persons belonging to the media with at least 10 years' standing be not registered unless cleared by a committee to be constituted by every state government, the composition of which should comprise of the Chief Justice of the High Court or a judge designated by him, the leader of the Opposition and the Home Minister of the State." Dua has said freedom of the press is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The plea has said the top court has been "emphasising for distancing the police from the ruling party in the state" but "none of the major political parties which are in power in various states are ready to give up their control over the police". "There is a recent trend against the media where state governments which do not find a particular telecast to be in sync with their political ideologies register FIRs against persons of the media primarily to harass them and to intimidate them so that they succumb to the line of the state or else face the music at the hands of the police," the plea has claimed. It claimed there is a concerted approach of authorities "to silence the media which is not palatable to them". It alleged that the FIR registered against Dua is "politically motivated" and is "purely to settle scores for critically evaluating the functioning of the central government at the present time of Covid".||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92
03-06-2021||India||Mehul Choksi denied bail by Dominica magistrate||A Dominica magistrate has denied bail to absconding diamond tycoon Mehul Choksi, who was arrested on May 23 for alleged illegal entry to the Caribbean island country, the local media reported. Choksi, wanted here in connection with a Rs 13,500-crore fraud in the Punjab National Bank (PNB), pleaded before the magistrate that he was abducted and forcibly brought to Dominica from neighbouring Antigua and Barbuda, about 100 nautical miles away, Dominica News Online reported. The 62-year-old wheelchair-bound diamantaire, who has a pending Interpol Red Corner Notice (RCN) against him, arrived before the presiding Roseau Magistrate Court in a black pair of shorts and a blue T-shirt from the Dominica China Friendship Hospital, where he is undergoing treatment. The Dominica High Court, which was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by Choksi, had ordered him to be presented before the magistrate to face charges of illegal entry. A habeas corpus petition is filed for producing before a court a person who is under arrest or in unlawful detention. "Our stand that Mehul Choksi is in illegal detention as he was required to be produced within 72 hours before the magistrate and was not so produced has been vindicated. In order to remedy this, he has been asked to be produced before the magistrate. This establishes the illegal detention of Choksi as pleaded by the defence. Contrary to numerous media reports, there was no discussion regarding the Government of India," Choksi's lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said here. During the hearing before Magistrate Candia Carrette-George, the Dominica prosecution cited two main arguments to keep Choksi under detention -- theN against him and the ongoing extradition proceedings in the courts of Antigua and Barbuda, where he is staying since 2018 after leaving India. Prosecutor Sherma Dalrymple told the court that Choksi is a "flight risk" and does not have any ties in Dominica that prevent him from fleeing the country if bail is granted. Defence counsel Wayne Norde said Choksi was not a flight risk considering his health and the pending extradition proceedings in Antigua and Barbuda were also a reason for him not to leave Dominica. Offering to pay a bail amount of ECD 10,000, double the fine amount for illegal entry to Dominica, Norde said Choksi did not have any criminal case in Antigua and Barbuda and the proceedings against him were civil in nature, which shows that he is a a man of good character. The lawyer said the new bail act says a defendant is entitled to the relief as a right unless the offence is of a serious nature. In her order, the magistrate said considering the "severity" of the matter, she is not convinced that Choksi will stay in the country to face legal proceedings and adjourned the matter till June 14.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92
03-06-2021||India||Covid: Trial and test waiver for foreign vaccines ||India has waived clinical trials and batch-by-batch testing on foreign Covid-19 vaccines approved by select foreign regulatory authorities, easing the possible entry of vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and a vaccine from China into the country. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has said it would waive the requirements of post-approval bridging clinical trials and testing of every batch of Covid-19 vaccines already approved by authorities in the US, UK, Europe, Japan and the World Health Organisation. In an order issued on Tuesday, the CDSCO said the waiver decision had been taken “in the light of the huge vaccination requirements in India … and the need for increased availability of imported vaccines to meet the national needs”. The order amends an April 15 decision by the CDSCO to grant restricted emergency use approval to foreign vaccines approved by select regulatory authorities but on the condition that the companies would post-approval conduct bridging clinical trials within 30 days. The CDSCO had also said that the first 100 recipients of such imported vaccines would be assessed for safety for seven days before such vaccines are rolled out into the vaccination campaign. The CDSCO’s June 1 order retains the condition that require safety observations on the first 100 recipients but has exempted such imported vaccines from bridging clinical trials and from the need to test every batch at India’s Central Drugs Laboratory. Health officials have asserted that the Indian government has been in talks with Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson, but the companies are unable to immediately supply their vaccines to India because they are supplying to other countries that had signed advance purchase pacts. Pfizer has indicated that it can supply 50 million doses to India in 2021 but will deal only with the central government. The company has also asked for indemnification from the Centre just as it had sought from the governments of over 100 other countries, including the US. The CDSCO waiver would in principle allow China’s Sinovac vaccine to enter the country as the vaccine received emergency use listing approval from the World Health Organisation on Tuesday. Public health experts have welcomed the waiver but some said it is belated. “This decision should have been taken over six months ago when it was clear that India would need imported vaccines,” said a public health specialist who requested anonymity. “We’re learning late, learning the hard way.” Pfizer had earlier this year sought emergency use approval for its Covid-19 vaccine in the country and had offered to provide logistical support for the vaccine’s transportation that requires temperatures lower than those demanded by Covishield and Covaxin — the current vaccines used in India. But a CDSCO expert panel had denied the approval in February amid what many health experts, including at least two members of India’s Covid-19 national task force, believe was high emphasis on domestically-produced vaccines. One top government medical researcher in early January had described Covishield — the AstraZeneca vaccine produced in India by the Serum Institute — as “make in India” and Covaxin, the homegrown vaccine from Bharat Biotech as “made in India” vaccines.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92
03-06-2021||India||Covid: A range of data suggests uncertain recovery for economy as jobs are lost in pandemic||Expectations for India’s economic growth are being revised sharply lower as a surge in people losing jobs and defaulting on debt suggest a more uncertain recovery from the financial shock of the Covid-19 pandemic. Economists are downgrading their estimates as a range of data from the rate of cheques bouncing to the amount of mortgaged gold jewellery up for sale — shows the extent of the economic damage from a devastating second wave of the disease. Some observers also fear the psychological blow from the virus disaster that ripped through India this year killing tens of thousands of people will leave consumers reluctant to spend. The Indian government is sticking with a forecast that the economy will grow 10.5 per cent in the fiscal year that started on April 1, but on Tuesday the State Bank of India — the country’s largest lender — slashed its growth forecast to 7.9 per cent from 10.4 per cent. Several international banks such as Barclays and UBS have also cut back their predictions. After a -7.3 per cent contraction in 2020-21 — the sharpest ever recorded by India — the relatively muted recovery puts India at odds with countries like the US and China that are seeing a swift rebound as they emerge from the pandemic. It suggests deeper damage has been done to an economy worth around $2.9 trillion before the crisis hit. The knock-on effects of sub-par growth on a rapidly developing economy like India could be significant. “GDP growth of less than 10 per cent will be a — I won’t use the word disaster, but it will not be very beautiful,” SBI’s chief economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh told Reuters after lowering his forecast. The situation has exacerbated unemployment that touched a 12-month high of 11.9 per cent in May from 7.97 per cent in April, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Rural unemployment that normally hovers around 6-7 per cent also hit double digit levels in May, according to the privately owned firm. Last year, India announced a $266 billion package to support the economy during a strict nationwide lockdown to contain the first coronavirus wave. But this was largely liquidity support given to banks to boost company credit, with less than a tenth of the sum used for welfare programmes for the poorest in the country. India did not launch job support schemes on the scale of those seen in some developed economies and the government has not announced a major stimulus package since the second wave hit. Surging unemployment coupled with state lockdowns, a large increase in hospitalisations and fatalities amid the second wave and fear of a third wave, are prompting many people to cut spending. Sales of goods including grocery, footwear, apparel and beauty products fell 49 per cent in April, according to the Retail Association of India, whose head Kumar Rajagopalan anticipates a bigger decline in May. Meanwhile, sales of cars and motorcycles fell 30 per cent in April over March and are expected to slump by over 60 per cent in May as automakers including Maruti Suzuki and Hero MotoCorp halted production for several days amid rising infections. Dealerships remain closed. While car sales bounced back after the first wave last year it was not on a scale seen elsewhere and the recovery was brief. In many other economies demand for big-ticket purchases soared when pent-up demand was released, with new car sales in Europe jumping 256 per cent year-on-year in April. Shashank Srivastava, executive director at Maruti Suzuki, India’s biggest carmaker, pointed to a deep psychological impact from the second virus wave as the surge in deaths and hospitalisations caused distress and fear among people. “Cars are a discretionary purchase that require people to be in a good frame of mind,” he said. One of India’s largest gold-financing companies, Manappuram Finance, auctioned gold worth about $55 million in the January-March quarter compared with $1.1 million in the preceding three quarters combined. The sales are being driven by rising defaults on mortgages secured on families’ gold jewellery which is typically passed on from generation to generation, a sign of long-term economic stress, experts say. Another warning sign is a rise in cheque bounces, which typically occur when there are insufficient funds in an individual’s account to meet deductions for loan payments or settlement of credit card bills. In May, the cheque bounce rate for loan payments doubled to 21 per cent from a year ago, while for credit cards it rose to 18 per cent from 10 per cent, according to data from Creditas Solutions, a fintech company involved in digital loan collections and recoveries. HDFC Bank, the country’s largest private bank, warned of further delinquencies in the coming months in the retail segment, which includes loans given to individuals for personal use. Highlighting the level of uncertainty in the financial sector, HDFC Bank’s CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan said on an investor call that for the “first time in so many years we may not have a grip of what is happening”. According to a survey conducted by Indian polling agency CVOTER, living standards of a large number of people have sharply fallen and most people do not see “any ray of hope in the coming 12 months”. CVOTER’s head Yashwant Deshmukh told Reuters people are going to hold back on buying a plethora of goods including cars and instead spend on insurance products and online skill development courses to make themselves more employable. “Nobody’s going to splurge,” he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92
03-06-2021||India||Payoff scandal in Kerala, southern state BJP chief silent||Female voice: “She said she had taken some money from some people when we were with the CPM. So they might create problems if she comes (to the NDA) without returning that money. That’s why she (now) wants Rs 10 lakh. “I have no role in this. If that can be given, she will be present at Amit Shah’s programme on the seventh…. So you can give the cash directly to her….” Male voice: “We can give it when she comes in person on the seventh.” Female voice: “She said it would be better if you could give it before that.” Male voice: “Let her come on the sixth, I shall give it. A money deal during election time — it’s not possible to carry it out.” If Union home minister and BJP leader Amit Shah does not order a probe into the content of the leaked phone conversation in which his name is mentioned and clear the air immediately, it will gift his opponents a chance to claim that this is the “toolkit” fine-tuned by his party to whip up favourable optics ahead of elections in states. Consider the information and versions available so far: ○ Praseetha Azhikode, treasurer of the Janadhipathya Rashtriya Party (JRP) in Kerala, has acknowledged that the female voice in the leaked audio conversation in Malayalam is hers. ○ Praseetha said on Wednesday she was referring to C.K. Janu, one of the most popular Adivasi rights leaders in Kerala before she became an ideology-agnostic player adept at choosing fair-weather political friends. On Wednesday, Janu, who has been suspended from the JRP that she had founded, denied any payoff and contested Praseetha’s claims. ○ Praseetha said the person she was speaking to over the phone was K. Surendran, president of the Kerala BJP. Usually never at a loss for words, Surendran had neither denied nor confirmed Praseetha’s charge till 10pm on Wednesday, by when several hours had passed since the audiotape hit the air waves. The state unit of the BJP is apparently ordering an “internal” probe. ○ On March 7 (presumably the “seventh” in the phone conversation), Union home minister Shah visited the Kerala capital to address the valedictory function of Surendran’s Vijay Yatra, an event organised in the run-up to the Assembly elections that took place almost a month later. Janu was present on the dais and Surendran, the state BJP chief, introduced her, a BJP video of the event shows. Such pre-poll yatras are a familiar fixture in Kerala, intended at galvanising the rank and file and showcasing recent converts. The issue goes far beyond Kerala because the BJP had been relying on a tactic of parading a galaxy of turncoats in most states, including Bengal, to create an impression, especially among parachute journalists, that the party enjoys a groundswell of support. In Bengal, the BJP had adopted such a “parade-and-pulverise” plan that gave some traction in the national media for Shah’s 200-plus boast although the party ended up as a distant runner-up in the eastern state. A longer version of the purported conversation (translated version reproduced at the end of this report) between Praseetha and Surendran suggests the initial amount demanded was Rs 10 crore, which was subsequently lowered to Rs 10 lakh and other benefits, for Janu to return to the NDA and share the platform with Shah. Formed in 2016, the JRP had in 2019 dumped the NDA for the Left Democratic Front but returned to the BJP fold ahead of the April 6 Assembly polls this year. The BJP drew a blank in the latest state elections. The payoff controversy could not have come at a worse time for the demoralised BJP that is already battling charges and bitter internal feuding in a money-laundering case in Kerala. On Wednesday, as Surendran remained silent, BJP veteran P.P. Mukundan said the “guilty must be punished”. “The party will conduct an internal investigation. Talks are on with the leaders concerned,” Mukundan told a TV channel in the evening. JRP treasurer Praseetha’s remarks came on Wednesday after the audio clip was leaked, reportedly by a faction in her party. Praseetha told reporters that the phone conversation had taken place ahead of the JRP’s return to the NDA on March 7 and that the money transaction took place at a hotel in Thiruvananthapuram. “She (Janu) demanded that money (Rs 10 crore). But Surendran was not ready to accept it (the demand). She then softened her stand by seeking some money in exchange for supporting the BJP,” Praseetha said. In the audio clip, the female voice seems to make a pitch for some money for herself: “Then I need to say something about myself. I have been running around for this for so many days. I don’t have any money left.” On Wednesday, Praseetha told a TV channel she did not ask for anything for herself but for the party. Janu had contested as an NDA candidate from Sulthan Bathery in Wayanad, losing to her Congress rival. The JRP last week suspended her from the party for six months for allegedly trading votes. The NDA had polled about 15,000 fewer votes in Sulthan Bathery compared with its 2016 tally. Janu denied the payoff charge. “I wouldn’t need an intermediary like Praseetha if I really wanted to have a monetary deal with Surendran,” she told a TV channel on Tuesday. “I have good relations with everyone in Kerala; I even have connections with Union minister Amit Shah. Why should I go through an intermediary when I have such connections?” The audio clip The audio begins with a female voice saying: “We know that you can’t agree to the Rs 10 crore she had asked for.” Male voice: “So what is she saying now?” Female voice: “She said she had taken some money from some people when we were with the CPM. So they might create problems if she comes (to the NDA) without returning that money. That’s why she (now) wants Rs 10 lakh. “I have no role in this. If that can be given, she will be present at Amit Shah’s programme on the seventh (understood to be March 7). That apart she wants the (Sultan) Bathery seat for herself. We don’t need any other seats. Then the post (not clear what post) you spoke about… after the election. So you can give the cash directly to her. “Then I need to say something about myself. I have been running around for this for so many days. I don’t have any money left.” Male voice: “Speak on, speak on, don’t waste time.” Female voice: “So you should give us some more money because this is for party work, not for personal use.” Male voice: “Understood. How and where?” Female voice: “Sirji, you can say where we should come.” Male voice: “We can give it when she comes in person on the seventh.” Female voice: “She said it would be better if you could give it before that.” Male voice: “Let her come on the sixth, I shall give it. A money deal during election time — it’s not possible to carry it out.” (This seems an allusion to the stringent checks on carrying cash during election time.) The female voice says she plans to call a news conference on the sixth, presumably to announce the shift to the NDA. Male voice: “Come on the sixth morning, I shall give the money. You can come to Thiruvananthapuram on the sixth and can stay there for a day. We will all be in Thiruvananthapuram on the sixth.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92
03-06-2021||India||Centre’s amendment to pension rules is a ‘gag’ on security officials||The Centre’s latest amendment to the pension rules for officials who had worked for the intelligence or security establishment is a “gag order” aimed at pre-empting criticism and dissent, several retired IPS officers and security officials have told The Telegraph. Under the amended rules, notified on Monday, no government servant who has worked in intelligence or security can publish anything related to these organisations after retirement without permission. They will now have to sign such an undertaking on retirement, and failure to comply can lead to pension being withheld or withdrawn. The amendment is likely to impact retired police chiefs and officials of security-related organisations who regularly write columns for newspapers or news portals, pen their memoirs or write books on their former organisations. A former Intelligence Bureau director, who requested anonymity, told this newspaper: “The rules have been amended only to control the narrative and any expression of dissent. This is nothing but a clear attempt to browbeat retired IPS officials not to express views contrary to government policy.” Others who spoke to this newspaper too were unwilling to go on record. A former director-general of Uttar Pradesh police said the amendment was meant to create a sense of fear among retired officials from security organisations. “Several of them appear on TV to express their opinions on government policies and write newspaper columns defending the founding principles of the republic,” he said. The former DG said: “The Centre wants to crush any dissent. By amending the rules the government has sent a warning to its critics.” The May 31 gazette notification says that “no government servant who has worked in any intelligence or security-related organisation included in the Second Schedule of the Right to Information Act, 2005, shall, without prior clearance from the head of the organisation, make any publication after retirement of any material relating to and including domain of the organisation, including any reference or information about any personnel and his designation, and expertise or knowledge gained by virtue of working in that organisation”. It forbids officials from sharing sensitive information “the disclosure of which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the state, or relation with a foreign State or which would lead to incitement of an offence”. Among the 18 organisations covered by the new rules are the Research and Analysis Wing, Intelligence Bureau, Enforcement Directorate, Central Bureau of Investigation, Border Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, Central Industrial Security Force and the National Security Guard. A former BSF director-general said the amendment was a “gag order”. He said the UPA government had in 2008 asked retired officers to seek permission from the heads of their departments before publishing material “the disclosure of which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India”. “The new rule has widened the scope to any information whatsoever. Now you cannot write anything,” he said. The 2008 rule was not tied to pensions, either. Monday’s gazette notification was issued by the department of personnel and training, which reports to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On Wednesday, government sources issued a semi-official clarification, alleging a wrong and misleading narrative was being created around the amended rules. They said the amendment was aimed at removing any confusion about the existing restrictions. “The intention is always to safeguard national interest. In the past, a few intelligence and government officials, who have worked in intelligence or security-related organisations, have publicly expressed themselves, by means of writing or speaking, revealing specific knowledge and sensitive information gained by virtue of having worked in that organisation,” the clarification said. “In order to bring clarity, these rules were issued. By no means do these rules deny any such former official from expressing his/ her views. In fact, it makes it easier for them to do so, given that they can now contact the head of their former employer organisation and seek clarification on whether the proposed material is sensitive or non-sensitive.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92
03-06-2021||India||Justice Arun Kumar Mishra takes charge as chairperson of National Human Rights Commission||Justice Arun Kumar Mishra, who retired last year as Supreme Court judge, took charge on Wednesday as the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). Justice Mishra, a judge known for his hard work who had retired from the Supreme Court on September 2 last year, had hit the headlines earlier when he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was a “versatile genius, who thinks globally and acts locally”. The chairperson and members of the NHRC are appointed by the President on the basis of the recommendations of a committee headed by the Prime Minister. The committee’s other members are the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the Union home minister, the leaders of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha and the deputy chairman of the Rajya Sabha. Under the original 1993 Human Rights Act, the chairperson has to be a former Chief Justice of India. However, in July 2019, the act was amended by inserting in Section 3 a sub clause 2(i) that used the expression “Chief Justice of India or a judge…” in the context of appointment as the chairperson. Until now, only acting chairpersons had been non-CJIs. Under Section 4(i) of the amended legislation, the original five-year tenure of the chairperson was reduced to three years or until the incumbent reached the age of 70, whichever was earlier. After the amendment, this is the first time that a judge of the Supreme Court is being appointed chairperson of the commission, following the superannuation of the incumbent chairperson, Justice H.L. Dattu, former Chief Justice of India. Justice Mishra, while extending his vote of thanks at a global jurists’ conference in the capital on February 23, 2020, had praised Modi effusively. The serving judge had complimented Modi and Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad for doing away with 1,500 obsolete laws. Justice Mishra had said that India had been a responsible and most friendly member of the international community under the “stewardship” of Modi. The comments did not go down well with the Bar. The then Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president, Dushyant Dave, had said the comments were unbecoming of the judiciary. Dave, in turn, faced the wrath of a section of the SCBA with some members convening a meeting on May 11 to try and remove Dave from his post of president and from the SCBA’s primary membership over his critical remarks against Justice Mishra. However, Dave managed to checkmate his detractor and critic Ashok Arora by removing the latter as SCBA secretary. Justice Mishra had handled several high-profile cases since his elevation to the Supreme Court on July 7, 2014, from Calcutta High Court where he was the Chief Justice.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92
03-06-2021||India||Covid-19: SC raises serious doubts about govt’s 'liberalised' jab policy||The Supreme Court on Wednesday raised “serious doubts” about the Narendra Modi government’s “liberalised” vaccine policy of “fixing higher prices as a competitive measure” and said it’s the responsibility of the Centre and not the states to provide free vaccination. If the Centre’s bulk buying of Covid vaccines is why it’s charged a lower price than the states and private hospitals, it’s all the more reason the Union government should use its “unique” position as a “monopolistic buyer” to procure all the doses and provide them free to all Indians, the court said. The bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud, L. Nageswara Rao and S. Ravindra Bhat said the Centre’s policy of allowing vaccine manufacturers to charge the states higher rates violated the fundamental right to equality, as did its policy of providing free vaccination only to those aged 45 and above. The court underlined that this year’s annual budget had set aside Rs 35,000 crore exclusively for vaccine procurement. “The central government is directed to clarify how these funds have been spent so far and why they cannot be utilised for vaccinating persons aged 18-44 years,” the court said. If the states are forced to provide free vaccines by spending their own money, it would affect their development schemes and efforts to improve their health infrastructure, the bench said. The court’s rebuke comes at a time several states, including Bengal, have demanded that the Centre provide free vaccination to all and underlined the country’s policy of free universal immunisation since Independence. The Centre is buying — at Rs 150 a dose — half the vaccines produced in India and providing these free to the states to inoculate those aged 45 or above free of cost at government facilities. The rest is to be bought by the states and private hospitals themselves directly from the vaccine makers. The states are charged Rs 300 per Covishield dose and Rs 400 per Covaxin dose while the private hospitals pay Rs 600 for Covishield and Rs 1,250 for Covaxin. Some state governments are nevertheless offering free vaccines also to those aged between 18 and 45 at their facilities while everybody has to pay for the jabs at private hospitals. The court questioned the Centre’s argument that having the states and private hospitals buy half the vaccines would “attract more private manufacturers that could eventually drive down prices”, highlighting that the Union government had pre-fixed the prices. “Prima facie, the only room for negotiation with the two vaccine manufacturers was on price and quantity, both of which have been pre-fixed by the central government,” the bench said. “This casts serious doubts on UoI’s (Union of India’s) justification for enabling higher prices as a competitive measure. Furthermore, the central government justifying its lower prices on account of its ability to place large purchase orders for vaccines raises the issue as to why this rationale is not being employed for acquiring 100 per cent of the monthly doses.” Risk query The court rejected the argument that the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech (BBIL) — the manufacturers of Covishield and Covaxin, respectively — deserved to charge higher prices to the states because they had borne the risk of manufacturing the vaccines with their own money. The bench stressed that this year’s budget had earmarked Rs 46 crore as initial payment to the two manufacturers under the private-public partnership model. “Since the central government has financed (officially, Rs 35 crore to BBIL and Rs 11 crore to SII for phase 3 clinical trials) and facilitated the production (or augmentation of production) of these vaccines through concessions or otherwise, it may not be accurate to state that the private entities have alone borne the risk and cost of manufacture,” the bench said. “Additionally, the central government would have minimised the risks of the manufacturers by granting emergency use authorisation to the vaccines, which should (be) factor(ed) into its pricing.” The court questioned the Centre’s policy of “intervening in pre-fixing procurement prices and quantities for states/ UTs and private hospitals, but not imposing statutory price ceilings”. The bench said the Centre’s policy of ensuring free vaccines at government facilities only for the 45-plus and frontline workers ran counter to the fundamental right to equality guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution. Also, in the context of the Centre “receiving vaccines at a much lower rate from manufacturers, it is important for us to examine the rationality of the existing liberalised vaccination policy against Article 14 of the Constitution, since it could place severe burdens, particularly on states/ UTs (Union Territories) suffering from financial distress”.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92
03-06-2021||India||Covid: Bombay High Court query on jabs at doorstep ||Bombay High Court on Wednesday said when Covid-19 vaccination drives are now being held in several housing societies, why can authorities not take a step further and go to the homes of senior citizens, disabled and bedridden people to inoculate them. The court was hearing a PIL filed by lawyers Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari, seeking a direction to the Union and state governments to start door-to-door vaccination for senior citizens above the age of 75, specially-abled, bedridden and wheelchair-bound people. The petition said such people would not be in a position to step out of their homes and travel to vaccination centres. A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni on Wednesday noted that several housing societies are now tying up with private hospitals and holding vaccination drives in the society premises itself. “If this is being done, then you (government and other authorities) can take a step further and go to the homes |of such people (who are not able to go to vaccination centres),” Chief Justice Datta said. The Centre sought further time, following which the court posted the matter for next hearing on June 8. Singh told the high court that by Julyend, the availability of vaccines, both Covishield and Covaxin, will increase. “Currently, there are 90 lakh Covaxin doses available. By the end of July, the number will increase to 5.5 crore. Similarly, the supply of Covishield vaccine will also increase to approximately two crore each month by July,” he said. The court then asked Singh by when does the Union government expect the entire population of the country to be administered the first dose of the Covid19 vaccine. Singh said the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said it would be done by December 2021.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92
03-06-2021||India||Covid vaccine policy 'arbitrary and irrational': Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Wednesday described as “prima facie arbitrary and irrational” the Centre’s policy of leaving adults aged below 45 to pay for their Covid-19 jabs while providing for free vaccination of those aged 45 or above. While the Centre is not bearing the cost of the jabs for those aged between 18 and 45, some state governments are offering them free vaccination at their own expense. The apex court also asked the Centre to explain its preparedness to meet children’s possible needs if there’s a third wave that affects them. It agreed with its amici (friends) — senior advocates Jaideep Gupta and Meenakshi Arora — that the central government’s current vaccination policy was flawed. It highlighted that during the second wave of the pandemic, many people aged between 18 and 45 had not just been infected but suffered severe illness, sometimes leading to death. “Due to the changing nature of the pandemic, we are now faced with a situation where the 18-44 age group also needs to be vaccinated, although priority may be retained between different age groups on a scientific basis,” the bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud, L. Nageswara Rao and S. Ravindra Bhat said. “Hence, due to the importance of vaccinating individuals in the 18-44 age group, the policy of the central government for conducting free vaccination themselves for groups under the first 2 phases, and replacing it with paid vaccination by the State/UT (Union Territory) governments and private hospitals for the persons between 18-44 years is, prima facie, arbitrary and irrational.” The court agreed with the amici that the states had been left in the lurch because of the Centre’s refusal to procure for them their entire vaccine requirement. It noted that many states and municipal bodies had floated tenders and tried to negotiate with foreign vaccine manufacturers, but largely without success as overseas companies prefer negotiating with Union governments. The bench asked the Centre to provide clarifications on several issues, such as: ⚫ The Centre must place on record a projection of vaccine availability till December 31, and give details of vaccination trials and regulatory approvals. ⚫ The Centre should clarify whether its policy allows the states or local bodies to import vaccines. ⚫ The Centre should provide the number of crematorium workers vaccinated in Phase 1. A targeted drive can be conducted to vaccinate the remaining crematorium workers. ⚫ Reports say some states are vaccinating over-45s with doses they have bought from manufacturers for younger adults, all because of a shortage of supply from the Centre. How will the Centre factor this in while deciding subsequent allocations to the states? ⚫ The Centre must disclose the nature of its intervention with respect to the final, end-user price that is being charged by private hospitals. ⚫ How will the Centre monitor the disbursal of vaccines by private hospitals, specifically those that have pan-India hospital chains? ⚫ Are private hospitals (that are part of interstate chains) bound to administer a quantity of vaccines in a state in proportion to its population? What is the mechanism to ascertain whether private players are indeed administering a state’s quota of vaccines solely to its residents? ⚫ The Centre must place on record any written policy in relation to this: whether it conducted a “means-test” of the demographic of a state or Union Territory to assert that half the population aged between 18 and 45 would be able to afford the vaccine. If not, what is the rationale for private hospitals being provided an equal quota for procurement as the states? ⚫ The Centre must explain the manner in which it and the states will ensure an equitable distribution of vaccines across sections of society.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-92
03-06-2021||India||Bar Council of India constitutes a committee to evaluate pattern of LLB exams ||The Bar Council of India (BCI) which regulates legal education and lawyers, on Wednesday constituted a 12-member expert committee to evaluate the pattern of LLB exams in view of requests from various quarters. The committee is headed by Justice Govind Mathur, former Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court. According to the BCI chairperson Manan Kumar Mishra, the council had initially been against interfering with the present system since earlier guidelines issued by it had been quashed by Karnataka High Court on February 8. However, the BCI said, students of several centres of legal education, including 273 students of law at Delhi University, had sent emails requesting that the LLB intermediate semester exams and promotions be held as per UGC guidelines that recommend 50 per cent weightage to internal assessment and 50 per cent to performance in exams. Also, Prof. Vandana, the dean of the faculty of law at Delhi University, had written to the BCI saying DU had asked her to find out if there were any instructions on LLB exams in the open-book blended (internal assessment and practical exams) mode. The exams are to begin on June 10.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-93
03-06-2021||India||Covid: Central universities await admission signal after cancellation of board exams||Central universities are awaiting a decision from the government on the college admission process after the CBSE and the CISCE cancelled this year’s Class XII board exams on Tuesday in view of the pandemic. The Centre is to decide whether to hold two sets of common entrance tests for admission to undergraduate and postgraduate courses. The plan for common admission tests is part of the new National Education Policy. However, the education ministry is yet to take a final call. If a common entrance exam is not introduced this year, the colleges and universities will have to fall back on the usual practice of taking in students on the basis of board exam marks. However, there is no clarity yet on how Class XII students will be evaluated this year, now that the board exams have been cancelled. “We will go by the decision of the government on admissions. If a common entrance exam is held, students will be assessed on a common platform and rankings will be transparent. In case it is not held, we will follow our usual selection process based on board marks (for most courses),” said Delhi University registrar Vikash Gupta. DU has about 70 colleges offering undergraduate courses. Students from across the country apply for admission to the DU colleges. The DU admission process usually begins on June 1. Gupta said the process might be delayed this year because of the pandemic but promised that students would not suffer. The subjects will be covered by making up for lost time over the three-year course period, the DU registrar said. For the Class X exams, which too have been cancelled, students will be graded on the basis of internal assessments and school exams, including the pre-board tests. Former DU executive council member Rajesh Jha said the universities should take decisions on academic affairs without waiting for the government’s signal. “In recent years, we are seeing that the central government and the UGC have been taking decisions on behalf of central universities. Such a practice is weakening the institutions,” Jha said. Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) conducts its own entrance exams for undergraduate and postgraduate courses. In a statement, vice-chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar has said the exams will be conducted whenever it is safe for the students to appear for them. The exams are to be held at designated centres and will be computer-based. Most universities are likely to hold their end-semester exams for undergraduate and postgraduate courses for award of degrees online. DU has decided to hold online open-book exams (OBE) like last year. The exam is likely to start on June 7. The test pattern will be a bit different this time. While last year students had to answer four out of eight questions, this year they will have to attempt three out of four questions. Other central universities are also planning online exams. “Many students are in favour of online exams. They want their degrees,” said a faculty member of Assam University in Silchar. Academics have suggested that end-semester results can be announced based on the marks of the previous five semesters. However, Prof. Sri Prakash Singh of DU has argued against such a mode. “These students are likely to pursue further studies. They should not face any questions over their degrees,” Singh said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-93
03-06-2021||India||Covid: BJP applauds Yogi on managing pandemic 'effectively'||Bodies floating in rivers, corpses buried under riverbeds, crematoriums overflowing, people crying for oxygen and hospital beds, a government twisting the knife into the gaping wound by threatening sufferers into silence, but Yogi Adityanath has managed the pandemic “quite effectively”. The assessment of performance has been made by a central BJP leader who had been sent to Uttar Pradesh to gauge the organisational preparedness before the Assembly elections due early next year. The unequivocal praise from B.L. Santhosh, the BJP national general secretary in charge of organisation, suggested that the party’s top leadership had reposed faith in Hindutva poster boy Adityanath. “In five weeks, @myogiadityanath’s Uttar Pradesh reduced the new daily case count by 93%.… Remember it’s a state with a 20+ crore population. When municipality CMs couldn’t manage a city of 1.5 cr population, Yogiji managed quite effectively,” Santhosh tweeted late on Tuesday night. There was more applause in store for Adityanath. Santhosh tweeted on Wednesday: “UP govt led by CM Sri @myogiadityanath decides to vaccinate parents of children below 12 years. A wise move considering the logic that if at all third wave comes it may affect children more. Parents will be around to look after more safely.” Besides conveniently sweeping under the carpet the glaring evidence of gross mismanagement of the pandemic, Santhosh’s tweets also meant the central leadership had no intention of bringing about a change of leadership in the sprawling heartland state despite widespread discontent among the BJP rank and file over Adityanath’s autocratic ways and the handling of Covid. Santhosh reviewed over two days the Uttar Pradesh government’s and the BJP’s preparedness for the Assembly elections along with former Union minister Radha Mohan Singh, the party’s minder for the state. BJP leaders in Uttar Pradesh said that during the meetings held over Monday and Tuesday, Santhosh indirectly made it clear that the party would go to the polls under the leadership of Adityanath and asked everyone to ensure better coordination between the government and the party to win the trust of the people. Ironically, it had been reports of despair and helplessness and widespread criticism of the Adityanath government over its tackling of the pandemic that had apparently prompted the central leadership to rush Santhosh and Singh to Uttar Pradesh for the stock-taking exercise. Several of the BJP’s own ministers and MLAs have been resentful of the administration’s handling of the situation. “What stature do MLAs have? If I speak too much, sedition charges could be slapped on me,” BJP MLA Rakesh Rathore had told reporters in May when asked what he had done to operationalise a trauma centre in his constituency, Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh. Union labour minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar, who hails from Uttar Pradesh, too had written to Adityanath, complaining that officials had been unresponsive to the woes of Covid-affected people. Many other BJP leaders have publicly aired their views on how the state government had been missing in action when Covid cases surged. The certificate of excellence from Santhosh, who is said to enjoy the confidence of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, has glossed over the many apparent failings of Adityanath, the saffron-robed temple mahant known for his vitriolic and communally charged utterances and iron-fisted rule. Attacks on Muslims, who make up over 20 per cent of Uttar Pradesh’s population, and their systematic targeting have become a routine affair in the state. The assault has continued even during the pandemic and Muslims fear it could intensify in the run-up to the polls to polarise voters. The administration of Barabanki district recently razed a mosque, terming it an illegal construction despite a court order to keep in abeyance any demolition during the pandemic. A Muslim meat trader was beaten up by a cow vigilante group in Moradabad and a vegetable vendor in Unnao died recently after the police thrashed him. Adityanath, however, appears to have gone from strength to strength within the party. Prime Minister Modi often addresses him as “yashashwi aur lokpriya mukhyamantri (glorious and popular chief minister)”.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-93
03-06-2021||India||Covid: No jab, no salary in Uttar Pradesh’s Firozabad district ||The May salaries of state government employees in Uttar Pradesh’s Firozabad district will be withheld if they don’t get at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine in the next three days, the administration has decreed. The anti-Covid vaccination drive is not compulsory anywhere in the country. Charchit Gaur, the chief development officer of the district, told reporters on Wednesday the decision was taken after it was found that many employees were not getting vaccinated. He said district magistrate Chandra Vijay Singh had issued an oral order as enough vaccine doses were available in government hospitals. “We noticed that employees of many government departments had not got themselves vaccinated. So the DM ordered that the department heads of Firozabad take action against those employees who were not taking interest in vaccination. The HoDs will ensure that such employees don’t receive their salaries for May till they get the first dose of vaccine,” Gaur said. The employees have been asked to submit proof of vaccination within three days. Gaur said a positive message would be sent across to the society if government employees got themselves inoculated, and people in general would take vaccines in large numbers. An education department employee in the district said his office had received a vaccination notice signed by the district probation officer. “I will go to the nearest vaccination centre on Thursday,” the employee said. Anil Kumar, a block development officer who visited a vaccination centre in Firozabad city on Wednesday, said: “I didn’t take the vaccine earlier because I was on medication for an illness. Today, I am here for the vaccine. I believe our bosses have taken a good decision to make the country corona-free.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-93
03-06-2021||India||Covid: Congress fires volley of vaccine questions ||The Congress on Wednesday bombarded Prime Minister Narendra Modi with withering questions on vaccines, arguing that failure to plan in advance, a wrong approach and lack of vision had botched up the most critical exercise of fighting the pandemic. Raising a Twitter storm in favour of free universal vaccination, hundreds of Congress leaders posted videos and messages highlighting the shortcomings in the inoculation drive. The issues ranged from the failure to draw up a comprehensive plan to cover a significant section of the population within a reasonable time frame to placing orders for vaccines in time and the deficiencies in the modes of procurement and distribution. The majority of the Congress leaders insisted that it had been a saga of confusion and failures from the very start of the battle against the coronavirus. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra alleged that the Prime Minister had run away, abdicating his responsibilities as the crisis deepened during the second wave. “We are one of the biggest vaccine manufacturers in the world. Yet only 3.4% of our population is fully vaccinated. Who is responsible for India’s confused and dithering vaccination programme? #SpeakUpForFreeUniversalVaccination,” she tweeted. Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, wondered what happened to the comprehensive plan that Modi had talked about from the ramparts of the Red Fort on August 15, 2020. Congress veteran from Uttar Pradesh Pramod Tewari said Modi had done nothing right — from delaying a ban on international flights when Covid cases had been rising across the world to planning the vaccination campaign. Tewari insisted that villagers would not be able to take vaccines if they were not offered free, demanding that the Centre fund the entire exercise. Young leader from Gujarat Hardik Patel pointed out that the Modi government was not realising that vaccinating every citizen was its duty. “(As much as) Rs 1,000 is being charged for one dose in Ahmedabad. This is not the time to make money,” Patel said. Jharkhand health minister Banna Gupta asked the Prime Minister to spend a portion of the lakhs of crores his government had earned by taxing petroleum products on vaccinating the poor. Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said India was the only country where states had been made to negotiate with global firms. This proved to be a futile exercise as foreign vaccine manufacturers had refused to deal with the states as their policy allowed them to do business with sovereign governments only. The RSS-BJP ecosystem had tried to blame the Opposition-ruled states for this policy, questionably tying it to the states’ demand for flexibility and decentralisation. Congress leaders, however, said no state had ever sought to directly deal with global firms and buy vaccines with their own money. The Congress said the states had called for consultations with them, apart from flexibility and decentralisation in carrying out the vaccination drive. The leaders said the states were badly stressed for finances due to welfare measures during lockdowns and non-payment of GST dues by the Centre. The Congress politicians argued that vaccination should be free of cost for the citizens. The states undertook the responsibility for free vaccination only after the Modi government asked them to share the burden for people in the 18-44 age group. Shrinate alleged that this was a betrayal of citizens by the central government. “Why are there six rates for vaccines? Which country is carrying out vaccination like this? Why didn’t the government procure vaccines on time? Why didn’t they invoke compulsory licensing to ramp up production? Why didn’t the government approve vaccines by foreign manufacturers?” she asked. Another spokesperson, Ragini Nayak, said: “The RSS always talks of ‘Ek Vidhan-Ek Samidhan (One law-one Constitution). Why didn’t it speak for one-price for vaccines?” Former Gujarat Congress president Arjun Modhwadia recalled how previous governments ran successful vaccination drives against 12 diseases, including small pox, tuberculosis and polio, which resulted in life expectancy rising from 35 to 70 and not even a paisa ever being charged from any citizen. “Modi has introduced a new practice of charging the poor for vaccines. There are different rates — one for the Centre, one for states and one for private hospitals. This has hampered the vaccination drive,” Modhwadia said. Many leaders expressed shock and outrage at the Centre’s decision to allow the two Indian manufacturers to sell vaccines to states at a higher price. They wondered why couldn’t the Centre procure all the vaccines and distribute them among states as they had a better-negotiated price. Many leaders described this as abdication of responsibility and deliberately allowing the manufacturers to indulge in profiteering at a time of unprecedented humanitarian distress. Youth Congress chief B.V. Srinivas wondered where from the private hospitals were getting vaccines when government facilities had to close down because of shortages. He said: “The government has promised to the Supreme Court that the entire population will be vaccinated by December 2021…. The poor have no money to eat. Where from will they pay Rs 1,000 for vaccines? The government should ensure they get vaccinated without registration.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-93
03-06-2021||India||Supreme Court asks Centre for Covid vaccine data ||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Centre for data on the number of people vaccinated, volume of vaccines procured and ordered, and the timeline for inoculating the remaining population, directing that all relevant “file notings” be attached with the affidavit. It also directed the states and Union Territories to file affidavits explaining their stand on providing free vaccination to their people at the cost of the exchequer. This directive came in the light of the Centre’s argument that its refusal to fund the states’ entire vaccine requirement would not hurt citizens since a large number of states had announced free vaccination anyway. The court, however, clarified that it believed it was the Centre’s responsibility and not the states’ to ensure free vaccination for all Indians. “We direct the UoI (Union of India) to file an affidavit, which shall address the issues and questions raised, wherein it shall ensure that each issue is responded to individually and no issue is missed out,” the bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud, L. Nageswara Rao and S. Ravindra Bhat said. “While filing its affidavit, UoI shall also ensure that copies of all the relevant documents and file notings reflecting its thinking and culminating in the vaccination policy are also annexed (to) the vaccination policy. Hence, we direct the UoI to file its affidavit within two weeks.” Some of the information the bench sought: ⚫ Data on the percentage of population vaccinated, with one or both doses, so far against the population of eligible people. This should include separate data on the rural and urban populations. ⚫ Complete data on the Centre’s purchase of all the Covid-19 vaccines (Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik V). The data should clarify: (a) the dates of all the procurement orders placed by the central government for all three vaccines; (b) the quantity of vaccines ordered on each date; and (c) the projected date of supply and an outline of how and when the Centre seeks to vaccinate the remaining population. ⚫ The steps being taken by the Centre to ensure drug availability for mucormycosis. “We also note that UoI’s stated position in its affidavit dated 9 May 2021 is that every state/UT government shall provide vaccination free of cost to its population,” the bench said. “It is important that individual state/UT governments confirm/deny this position before this court. Further, if they have decided to vaccinate their population for free then, as a matter of principle, it is important that this policy is annexed to their affidavit, so that the population within their territories can be assured of their right to be vaccinated for free at a state vaccination centre. “Hence, we direct each of the state/ UT governments to also file an affidavit within two weeks, where they shall clarify their position and put on record their individual policies.” The next hearing will be on June 30.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-93

Odisha had floated a global tender for procurement of vaccines from national and international companies but the response has been lukewarm with leading manufacturers not participating in the bid process. In his letter to other chief ministers, Naveen stressed the need for central purchase of vaccines. He pointed out that there was a great demand from citizens for jabs after the Centre announced the third phase of its vaccination drive, which allowed inoculation of people above 18 years and opened procurement options to state governments and to private sectors. “Many states have floated global tenders for vaccine procurement. However, it is quite clear that the global vaccine manufacturers are looking forward to the Union government for clearances and assurances. They are unwilling to get into supply contracts with the state governments, while the domestic vaccine manufacturers are having supply constraints and are not able to commit required supplies. Under the above circumstances, the best option available is for the Government of India to centrally procure the vaccines and distribute it among the states so that our citizens are vaccinated at the earliest,” said Naveen. He added: “The only way to protect our people against future waves (of the pandemic) and provide them with a hope of survival is vaccination. Countries which have focused on vaccination programmes have seen remarkable improvement in their Covid situation. We have to provide this healing  touch to our people.” Underscoring the need to take up vaccination on a war footing, Naveen said: “No state is safe unless all the states adopt vaccination as the top priority and execute it on war footing. But, this cannot be a battle among the states to compete against each other to procure vaccines.” Naveen also made it clear that the execution of the vaccination programme has to be centralised and states allowed the flexibility to determine their own mechanism to ensure universal vaccination. “Many hilly areas can not access the Internet and therefore online registration has to be flexible. Vulnerable tribes can be given priority by the states,” the chief minister said. He said: “We have written to the Union government in this regard. However, I would respectfully suggest that all the state governments should come to a consensus on this issue for early resolution of this problem.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-93

Without naming retired Supreme Court judge Justice Arun Mishra who has been chosen the NHRC chairman, Kharge tweeted: “In my letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, I had raised concerns regarding the manner in which the NHRC appointments were made. “The BJP government refused to consider any SCs, STs, OBCs or minorities. Further, the appointments smack of partisanship & quid pro quo. I strongly condemn this.” Kharge had said in a statement on May 31 after a meeting at the Prime Minister’s Office where the NHRC chairperson was selected: “I reiterated at today’s meeting my concern over the rise in the cases of atrocities on Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and minorities and proposed that at least one person belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and minorities be recommended for the appointment either to the post of chairperson under Section 3(2)(a) or a member under section 3(2)(c) or a member under Section 3(2)(d) to the National Human Rights Commission from amongst the existing list of candidates.” Kharge had added: “I also pointed out that appointment of the chairperson or a member of the NHRC cannot simply be ignored on the pretext that there is no specific provision to this effect in the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, and amendments made thereto. Obviously, there cannot be any bar to appoint either the chairperson or a member to the NHRC on this ground.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-93
