In the wake of several Congress leaders quitting the party and its Punjab unit in turmoil, Sibal demanded that an immediate meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) be convened and wondered who in the party was taking decisions in the absence of a full-time president.  Sibal, a member of the 'Group of 23' which last year had written to Congress President Sonia Gandhi, said at a press conference that the grouping is "not a Jee Huzur 23" and will continue to put forth the views and will continue to repeat the demands.  Carrying 'Get Well Soon Kapil Sibal' placards and raising slogans against Sibal, Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) workers protested outside his Jor Bagh residence, saying they were "hurt" by his remarks.  "The workers went there on their own accord as they felt hurt by Sibal's remarks. They just expressed their disappointment over the remarks," a senior DPCC functionary said on condition of anonymity.  The protesters raised slogans against Sibal asking him to "leave the party".  Several leaders hit out at Sibal for what they said was questioning the leadership from which he had earlier "benefitted".  Youth Congress chief Srinivas B V said on Twitter, "Listen 'Ji-Huzoor' :- The 'President' and 'Leadership' of the party are the same, who always ensured your entry in Parliament, made you a 'minister' during the good times of the party, when in opposition, ensured your entry into Rajya Sabha, always rewarded with responsibilities in good and bad times. And when the 'time' came for struggle, then..."  Congress general secretary Ajay Maken and Chhattisgarh minister T S Singhdeo hit out at Sibal for his remarks.  Delhi Congress leader Alka Lamba also slammed Sibal, alleging that she kept requesting him in the 2020 assembly elections to come to Chandni Chowk and campaign but he did not come.  "The workers whom Sibal called for a meeting at his home ahead of the polls, they joined Aam Aadmi Party the next day.... Will the Congress run on these people's strength?" Lamba said on Twitter.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-164

Justice Rekha Palli issued notices asking them to respond to the petition while listing the matter for further proceedings on December 1, when several similar petitions are also fixed for hearing.  The court orally observed that the right to be forgotten' depends on how far it has to be stretched.  'Right to be forgotten' depends on how far it has to be stretched. Tomorrow, people who defraud the banks will come and say 'please remove the judgment'. We have to balance the rights," it said.  The court was hearing a petition by one Sukhmeet Singh Anand seeking removal of a judgement and an order passed in 2015 and 2018 in connection with an FIR registered against him in 2014 by the Economic Offences Wing here.  The FIR was registered against the petitioner and other persons in 2014 pursuant to a complaint by Samsung Gulf Electronic FZE, Dubai.  The plea, filed through advocate Tarun Rana, said merely by typing Singh's name on Google, the web page takes visitors directly to the links of the orders.  In August 2018, the petitioner had challenged the non-bailable warrants issued against him and the plea was dismissed by the high court.  Thereafter, he filed another plea seeking directions to the high court registry to block search engines from assessing the orders in the matter, which was also dismissed in May 2019.  The plea referred to an interim order passed by the high court in April this year, directing removal of the judgement from the search results regarding the petitioner in that case.  It said the petitioner sent a notice to Kanoon Software Pvt Ltd to withdraw the orders from its system; however, it refused to remove the orders on the pretext of website policy.  The petitioner also sent notices to the Centre and Google to take necessary steps for removal of the two orders from being viewed through the web portal. Google also showed inability to do anything in this regard, it said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-164
29-09-2021||India||Remnants of Cyclone Gulab might generate another cyclonic storm||After remnants of cyclone Gulab that hit the eastern coast of the country brought torrential rains to central Maharashtra, a senior IMD official said on Wednesday that we are witnessing a rare occurrence as the weather system might generate another cyclonic storm.  Dr Jayant Sarkar, head of the regional meteorological department of the India Meteorological Department, said such phenomenon does not happen very frequently, "though it is known among our fraternity." "It did bring excess showers over Maharashtra and put most of the regions such as Konkan, Madhya Maharashtra and Marathwada into surplus precipitation category, he told PTI.  A cyclone starts with a `depression'. Generally, a cyclonic system loses its severity once it hits the land, because the supply of moisture goes down. Cyclone Gulab hit the land between Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam on the eastern coast. But despite losing moisture supply, the system kept moving on westwards and brought intense showers over Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and later Gujarat in the last three days, said Sarkar.  The weather system received some moisture and it accelerated towards the Arabian Sea and it is expected to leave the land from Saurashtra region. With more moisture it would get intensified from depression to deep depression to cyclone," he said.  "At the same time, it will take away moisture from the coastal areas and reduce the rainfall over Gujarat's Saurashtra region as well as north Madhya Maharashtra and Konkan region, he said.  If it transforms into a new cyclone, it will be named `Shaheen', he said. Cyclonic storm Gulab made landfall on Sunday evening between Gopalpur in south Odisha and Kalingapatnam in north Andhra Pradesh, a few hours after two tourists from Bengal drowned in Balasore while bathing in an already turbulent sea. The storm’s impact was felt in the Odisha districts of Gajapati, Rayagada, Koraput and Malkangiri. Srikakulam district of Andhra has also been affected. Further rains pounded several parts of Telangana on Monday, even as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned that heavy rains are expected at isolated places in different districts of the State. The downpour caused waterlogging on some roads and low-lying areas. The cyclone, which crossed the Bay of Bengal coast near Kalingapatnam on Sunday night, weakened into a depression and caused widespread rains in several districts of Andhra Pradesh on Monday and also left a trail of destruction, as the death toll rose to two with a woman's death. Heavy rain in catchment areas of the Manjara dam forced authorities to open all its gates for water discharge on Tuesday, leading to flooding in some villages of Maharashtra's Beed district and neighbouring Latur, while an alert was sounded in other neighbouring districts of the Marathwada region, officials said. The local administration opened all 18 gates of the Manjara dam and 11 gates of the Majalgaon dam early Tuesday morning, resulting in discharge of 78,397 cusec 80,534 cusec water from them, respectively, officials said. The discharge of water from the Manjara dam led to flooding in villages under Kaij and Ambajogai talukas of Beed district, Ambajogai tehsildar Vipin Patil said. Heavy rains were witnessed in 65 circles of Nanded, 30 in Latur, 29 in Beed, 17 in Hingoli, 13 in Jalna (13), 10 in Aurangabad and six in Parbhani.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-164
29-09-2021||India||Fighting wave of misinformation, YouTube bans false vaccine claims||YouTube is wiping vaccine misinformation and conspiracy theories from its popular video-sharing platform. The ban on vaccine misinformation, announced in a blog post on Wednesday, comes as countries around the world continue to offer free immunisations for Covid-19 to a somewhat hesitant public. Public health officials have struggled to push back against a steady current of online misinformation about the Covid-19 shot since development of the immunisation first got underway last year. YouTube's new rules will prohibit misinformation about any vaccine that has been approved by health authorities such as the World Health Organization and are currently being administered. The platform had already begun to crack down late last year on false claims about the Covid-19 vaccine. YouTube, which is owned by Google, will delete videos that falsely claim vaccines are dangerous or cause health issues, like cancer, infertility or autism a theory that scientists have discredited for decades but has endured on the internet. As of Wednesday, popular anti-vaccine accounts, including those run by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., were kicked off YouTube. We've steadily seen false claims about the coronavirus vaccines spill over into misinformation about vaccines in general, and we're now at a point where it's more important than ever to expand the work we started with Covid-19 to other vaccines, YouTube said in a prepared statement. The new rule will apply to general claims about vaccines as well as statements about specific vaccines, such as those given for measles or flu. Claims about vaccines that are being tested will still be allowed. Personal stories about reactions to the vaccine will also be permitted, as long as they do not come from an account that has a history of promoting vaccine misinformation.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-164

South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) mayor Mukesh Suryan confirmed that the restaurant has been closed.  "The Aquila restaurant was operating without a proper licence. It has now been shut after we issued a closure notice. We are also exploring other actions including imposing a penalty in accordance with the DMC (Delhi Municipal Corporation) Act against the eatery as it was functioning without approval from the civic body," Suryan told PTI.  SDMC officials said Wednesday a closure notice was issued to the Aquila Restaurant located at Ansal Plaza in Andrews Ganj on September 24 for operating without a valid licence.  The closure notice said the area public health inspector found during a check on September 21 that the facility is running without a health trade licence and under unhygienic conditions. It also flagged alleged encroachment on public land.  "The public health inspector again inspected the site on September 24 and found that the trade is running under the same condition. You are directed to close the trade within 48 hours of the receipt of this notice failing which suitable action including sealing will be taken without assigning further notice," the SDMC notice issued to the restaurant-owner said.  In his response on September 27, the owner said, "I have closed-down the above said trade immediately and I shall not run the same trade without SDMC Trade Licence under insanitary condition from health point of view and create nuisance."  In a social media post last week a woman had alleged she was refused entry in the south Delhi restaurant because she was wearing a saree.  The woman had also posted a short video of her argument with the restaurant staff, alongside a couple of pictures of herself in the saree.  Later, the restaurant claimed that the incident was "misrepresented".  In the SDMC House meeting Wednesday, Congress councillor from Andrews Ganj Abhishek Dutt raised the issue and moved a proposal demanding a fine of Rs 5 lakh be imposed against any restaurant, bar or hotel that denies entry to any person wearing traditional Indian attire.  "The Aquila restaurant was running illegally without licence. The notice was issued to the eatery only after I raised the issue. Now, the authorities have informed that the restaurant has been shut. It is a matter of probe that how the restaurant was running without a licence," he told PTI  Taking cognisance of the case, the National Commission for Women (NCW) had on September 23 had asked the Delhi Police to probe the incident.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-164

The advice comes days after the Trinamul MP criticised the Congress for allegedly failing to put up a credible fight against the BJP. If the Congress cannot fight the BJP, the TMC will and defeat the party, Abhishek Banerjee said. "The Congress has to leave its armchair politics and social media politics and hit the streets," he said. The bonhomie between the Congress and the TMC was strained recently after the Trinamul mouthpiece "Jago Bangla" claimed that party chief Mamata Banerjee, and not Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, has emerged as the face of the opposition against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-164

29-09-2021||India||Kapil Sibal demands immediate Congress Working Committee meeting, says 'G23' not 'Jee Huzur 23'||With several Congress leaders quitting the party and its Punjab unit in turmoil, senior party leader Kapil Sibal on Wednesday demanded that an immediate meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) be convened and wondered who in the party was taking decisions in the absence of a full-time president. Addressing the media, he said a senior member of the 'Group of 23' has written to Congress President Sonia Gandhi for convening the CWC meeting immediately to discuss the party affairs and the exodus. Sibal said the grouping is "not a Jee Huzur 23" and will continue to put forth the views and will continue to repeat the demands. He said the Congress needs to be strengthened as a strong opposition to take on the government and once again reiterated the demands of the group for holding elections to the Congress president, the CWC and the central election committee. He expressed anguish over the developments in the party in Punjab and the recent exodus of party leaders, saying all such issues need to be discussed at a party platform. "In our party at the moment there is no president. So we don't know who is taking these decisions. We know and yet we don't know," Sibal said. "I believe one of my senior colleagues has written to the Congress president to immediately convene a CWC. So that at least some things that we can't speak publicly, we can have a dialogue in the CWC as to why we are in this state," he said. Sibal said, "We are not 'Jee Huzur 23'. We will continue to put forth our views and will continue to repeat our demands." In an apparent attack on the party leadership, he said there is no monopoly in the power structure of any country or political party. He also quoted the words of Mahatma Gandhi to say that no school of thought can claim a monopoly of right judgment and we are all liable to err and are often obliged to revise our judgements. "In a vast country like this there must be room for all schools of thought, and the least therefore that we we owe to ourselves as to others is to try to understand the opponents' viewpoint. And if we cannot accept it, respect it as fully as we expect him to respect ours. It is one of the indispensable tests of healthy public life. "So, listen to our point of view. If you don't accept it, fine, but at least listen. We respect your point of view, but have the space to respect ours. Allow us that dialogue. There are no monopolies. No monopolies should be created in the power structures of any country or a party," Sibal said. Noting that they are not the ones who will leave the ideology of the Congress party and go anywhere else, he said it is ironic that those who were considered closest aides of the party leadership have left them and those who they thought were not close to them are still with them. "This is the irony of the Congress party. In such a situation, every Congress man has to think how to take the party forward and strengthen it. I would also say that those who have left us should come back, because Congress is the only ideology which cab sustain. It is the Congress alone can save this republic because the present dispensation is destroying the very foundations of our republic," he said. "So what do we need, We need open dialogue. We need conversations. We need to understand each other's point of view," he said, refusing to discuss the developments in Punjab, where the Congress party had changed its chief minister and installed a new state Congress president who also quit. Sibal said what is happening to the Congress in Punjab gives an advantage to Pakistan and the ISI. He said one knows the history of Punjab and the rise of extremism there and how forces across the border exploit the situation to create an atmosphere of uncertainty. "It is these forces that are the biggest threat to our country. The Congress should make sure they remain united. If someone has an issue it should be discussed and the conversation must take place from the senior-most member of the party. The organisational structure must be strengthened. "That will take place if there is an elected president, an elected CWC, an elected Central Election Committee, if the structure is strengthened bottom up," the senior Congress leader said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-164

He made the promise alleging that the BJP-led central government is fighting shy of conducting it, fearing that the caste census in the country will lead to the backward classes of people demanding their rights and due respect after this. "The BJP government at the Centre does not want to conduct caste census as it knows that backwards will demand their right and due respect after it. This is the biggest demand of backwards and Dalits," Akhilesh Yadav said in a statement here. Promising caste census in Uttar Pradesh if his party is voted to power in 2022 assembly polls, Akhilesh said, "We will ensure that backwards get their rights." Alleging that the crime rate in UP has grown exponentially, Akhilesh Yadav said, "The chief minister lies on the matter of crime and does not have any information on the NCRB data. The highest number of crimes against women is committed in UP, he asserted. He also reiterated his charge that veteran SP leader Azam Khan is being kept in jail in false cases. "Azam Khan has been kept in jail in fake cases, he said, adding maximum custodial deaths in the state have occurred during the present BJP regime. The CM visits his home district Gorakhpur regularly but crime is rising there, he alleged, adding police beat up a Kanpur businessman, visiting there, to death. Even saints are not safe in UP where over 40 sadhu and saints have been killed," he said. Terming the governance in UP a complete failure", Akhilesh said, "Common men are not heard. The BJP MLAs and MPs have to face the people's opposition in their own areas." He said the Centre is on a privatisation spree and if everything will be privatised, there will be no need of implementing reservation. On the Covid vaccination drive, he asked, "Why do the vaccination certificates not carry the photograph of the national flag?" He said the government should withdraw three farm laws as it would help business houses take away farmers' land. "The farmers will teach a lesson to the BJP in the coming assembly polls," he predicted.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-164

Gandhi, currently on a five-day visit to the state capital, held one-to-one meetings and discussed the election strategy with party leaders and office bearers, UP Congress' media convenor Lalan Kumar said. On the third day of her visit, she also met doctors and health workers and thanked them for their services during the corona pandemic. Gandhi said doctors and health workers served people round the clock during the corona crisis. Several young doctors also remained connected with UP Congress' helpline 'Hello Doctor', Lalan Kumar said, adding she discussed several health issues of the people. The Congress leader also appealed to young doctors to give their suggestions on the issues relating to health services in the state, Kumar said. Later during the day, she would be holding meetings with party secretaries and other leaders at the Kaul House where she is staying, he added. This is Priyanka Gandhi's second visit to Uttar Pradesh this month, the first one being between September 8 and 13. The Congress had fought the 2017 state assembly polls in alliance with the Samajwadi Party but had managed to win just seven of the 114 seats it had contested with a vote share of 6.25 per cent. This time, the Congress party has decided against having any poll alliance with any big party.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-165
29-09-2021||India||Amarinder meets Shah in Delhi, says they discussed farm issues||Former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh met Union Home Minister Amit Shah at his residence here on Wednesday, raising speculation over his future in politics. Later, he tweeted that he discussed the farmers' protest with the Union home minister and urged him to repeal the contentious farm laws. Amarinder's media adviser Ameen Thukral said too much was being read into the visit, reported ndtv.com. Singh arrived in the national capital on Tuesday, days after he quit as the chief minister of Punjab. The meeting assumes significance as Singh had not opened his cards but had claimed that he had not quit politics and would fight till the end. The veteran Congress leader had also launched a scathing attack on his bete noire, Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was appointed as the party's Punjab unit president. Sidhu quit as the Punjab Congress chief on Tuesday. As regards his political future, Singh had said there were several options before him. Sidhu had on Tuesday abruptly sent in his resignation from the post of Punjab Congress president, days after the party removed entrenched leader Amarinder Singh as chief minister following a tussle between the two. Sidhu’s sudden decision not only intensified the problems of the ruling Congress in poll-bound Punjab, it also caused deep embarrassment to Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as they had taken a huge risk by bulldozing all hurdles to project him as the supreme leader in the state. The majority of senior leaders in the high command structure had not been in favour of promoting Sidhu but Rahul and Priyanka appeared to have been swayed by his popularity in their effort to retain Punjab in the next election. Sidhu wrote in his resignation letter: “The collapse of a man’s character stems from the compromise corner. I can never compromise on Punjab’s future and the agenda for the welfare of Punjab. Therefore, I hereby resign as the president of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee. I will continue to serve the Congress.” He posted the letter on Twitter without clearance from the central leadership, sources said. The sources said that while Sidhu was upset because he wanted to become chief minister after Amarinder’s exit, his anger boiled over when new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi made appointments without his approval. But the dominant sentiment in the party is hostile towards Sidhu with most leaders condemning his “immaturity” as “unpardonable betrayal”. The sources claimed that even Rahul was livid. While Amarinder asserted that Sidhu was not a “stable personality”, most other senior leaders said Sidhu should have considered the risks Rahul and Priyanka had taken for him. They believe the Congress should persist with the pro-Dalit narrative in the aftermath of Channi’s elevation by discarding Sidhu and immediately appointing someone else as the state unit chief. These leaders are of the opinion that dilly-dallying will further complicate the web that the party looks stuck in. A senior leader told The Telegraph: “Sidhu is now raking up small issues without realising the overarching goal of winning the election. The main issue is that he feels the chief minister is not willing to be a puppet.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-165
29-09-2021||India||Maha survey indicates 75% Covid patients were overcharged by hospitals||As many as 75 per cent of Covid-19 patients were overcharged by private hospitals, a survey carried out in Maharashtra has found. “Nearly half of these patients died during treatment,” said Dr Abahy Shukla of the Jan Aarogya Abhiyan, an umbrella group of activists working in the healthcare sector. “We surveyed the cases of 2,579 patients, spoke to their relatives and audited the hospital bills. Ninety-five per cent of them were admitted to private hospitals,” he said. “We found that 75 per cent were overcharged. On average, the amount that was overcharged ranged between Rs 10,000 to Rs 1 lakh,” said Dr Shukla. Most of these patients were hospitalized during the second wave of the pandemic. There were at least 220 women among these patients who shelled out between Rs 1 lakh to 2 lakh more than the actual bill, while in 212 cases, the patients or their relatives paid more than Rs two lakh in excess, Dr Shukla claimed. “Though the Maharashtra government had announced that the rates of treatment of COVID-19 at private hospitals will be regulated, the official instructions were not heeded,” he said. “Many of these patients or their families faced a financial crisis, were forced to sell off jewelry, borrow from relatives or even take out loans from money lenders to settle the bills,” he said. As many as 1,460 (56 per cent) of the patients or their relatives faced this situation, as per the survey. “Seema Bhagwat, who lost her husband to mucormycosis, a fungal infection which some COVID-19 patients contracted,” said he was in hospital for 38 days and they were presented a bill of Rs 16 lakh. “Still, I paid three EMIs of the bank. There was insurance cover for the bank loan, but because I approached them late, they are denying my claim. How can they expect me to submit my husband's death certificate the day after he died?” she asked. “I am not begging for help. But the hospital bill should be audited and if I have been overcharged, the difference should be refunded to me,” she said. Shakuntala Bhalerao, convenor of the Abhiyan, said what is lacking is a law to regulate hospitals. “A draft of the clinical establishment bill which seeks to create a regulatory mechanism is gathering dust,” she added. “We fought two cases in Pune recently and the hospitals returned Rs 83,000 and Rs 90,000. They even admitted that they had overcharged. But we cannot fight each and every such case. There has to be some state mechanism to protect patients,” Bhalerao said. Mukund Dikshit, a senior activist, recounted that a police complaint had to be filed in Nashik because a hospital refused to hand over a patient's body over unpaid bill. “After intervention by the police and some activists, the body was handed over, but the hospital faced no action,” he said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-165

Channi also said the party is supreme and the government follows the party's ideology. "I have spoken to Sidhu sahab over the telephone today. Party is supreme and the government accepts the party's ideology and follows that. (I told him that) you should come, sit and talk, he told reporters on the sidelines of a cabinet meeting. The (state) president is the head of the party. The head has to sit among the family," he said, adding that Sidhu had agreed to meet. Sidhu, who had abruptly put in his papers plunging the Congress into a fresh crisis, on Wednesday broke his silence, questioning the appointments of the director-general of police, state's advocate general and tainted leaders. Channi, however, defended the appointments, saying he had acted on the basis of feedback from the party members. "I have no objection or any ego in anything," he said, indicating that he was ready to review the decisions. Asked what was Sidhu's response to his offer to talk it out, Channi said that Sidhu told him that he would give the time for the meeting. "We will sit with him and talk," he said. To a question, Channi said Minister Pargat Singh and some other leaders went to meet Sidhu. Asked if Sidhu had done the right thing, Channi said he could not comment on it. "I will never deviate from the issues of the people of Punjab," he asserted. He said, "Whatever feedback we got from colleagues and others and whosoever can be appointed, we appointed. But the decisions will be taken according to the will of the people of Punjab."||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-165

It has also advised that sanitary workers should be treated as "frontline health workers" for all purposes and made several recommendations to provide security cover and ensure protection of human rights of persons engaged in such hazardous work. In the advisory, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), headed by Justice Arun Kumar Mishra, calls for "fixing responsibility and accountability of local authority and contractor/employer, jointly and severally in case of any death that occur due to manual scavenging including hazardous cleaning". In a letter through its Secretary General Bimbadhar Pradhan to the secretaries of Union ministries and departments concerned, and the chief secretaries of states and administrators of union territories, the commission has asked for the implementation of its recommendations in the advisory and sought an action-taken report within three months, the panel said. These ministries include the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, and the National Commission for Safai Karamcharis, the rights panel said. The advisory has focused on various key areas which include ensuring proper safety gear for sanitary workers, use of technology, responsibility of hiring agencies or employers, authorities concerned, strengthening infrastructure for providing sanitary services, awareness, sensitisation, ensuring access to justice and rehabilitation of manual scavengers, it added. The NHRC has recommended that all sanitary workers entering or cleaning septic tanks or sewer lines must be provided helmets, safety jackets, gloves, masks, gumboots, safety glasses, and torchlights, along with oxygen cylinders. "Use of duly acknowledged and recognised technological equipment eg, Bandicoot, Swere Crocs, KAMJET GR, Mobile Septage Treatment Unit (MSU), etc be encouraged by stakeholders," another recommendation read. A nationwide database for rehabilitated and trained or skilled manual scavengers for providing required assistance, and ensuring proper identification of persons engaged in manual scavenging are other recommendations made by the NHRC. All officials in departments concerned at the Centre and in state and local bodies are to be sensitised, and measures should be taken to sensitise the public, besides monitoring of implementation of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation (PEMSR) Act, 2013, it said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-165

"I appeal to the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) area commander, the ISI and the Pakistan Army to take me back to my mother just like they sent me here (India)," Ali Babar Patra, the teenage terrorist from Pakistan, said in a video message released by the Army here on Wednesday. Patra was nabbed by the Army during a live encounter in the Uri sector on September 26, when he asked for his life to be spared. Another Pakistani infiltrator was killed in the nine-day operation that began on September 18. In the video message, Patra said the Pakistan Army, the ISI and the LeT were spreading lies about the situation in Kashmir. "We were told that the Indian Army is carrying out a bloodbath, but everything is peaceful here. I want to tell my mother that the Indian Army has taken good care of me," he said. He also said the behaviour of the officers and jawans of the Indian Army with the locals who visit the camp where he was lodged was extremely good. "I can hear the azaan (call for prayers) on the loudspeakers five times a day. The behaviour of the Indian Army is completely opposite to that of the Pakistan Army. This makes me feel that there is peace in Kashmir," Patra said. "On the contrary, they take advantage of our helplessness in Pakistani Kashmir to send us here," he added. Giving details of his initiation into terror ranks, Patra said he lost his father seven years ago and had to drop out of school due to financial constraints. "I took a job in a garment factory in Sialkot where I met Anas who used to recruit people for the LeT. Due to my situation, I went with him. He paid me Rs 20,000 and promised to pay another Rs 30,000 later on," he added. Patra also shared the details of the weapons training he underwent with the Pakistan Army and the ISI at Camp Khyber Delihabibullah.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-165

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is yet to take a decision in the matter. The last commercial flight between India and Afghanistan was operated by Air India on Kabul-Delhi route on August 15, the day Kabul fell to the Taliban. Afghanistan airspace was declared "uncontrolled" by the CAA on August 16. In a letter dated September 7, 2021, CAA's Acting Minister Alhaj Hameedullah Akhunzada requested the DGCA to permit commercial flights of Ariana Afghan airline and Kam Air between India and Afghanistan. Akhunzada stated in his letter: "As you are well informed that recently the Kabul airport was damaged and (left) dysfunctional by American troops before their withdrawal." With the help of technical assistance by Qatar, the airport became operational once again and a NOTAM (notice to airmen) in this regard was issued on September 6, he noted. "The intention of this letter is to keep the smooth passenger movement between two countries based on signed MoU and our national carriers (Ariana Afghan airline and Kam Air) aim to commence their scheduled flights," he said. "Therefore, Afghanistan CAA requests you to facilitate their commercial flights," Akhunzada noted. "The civil aviation of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan avails its highest assurance," he added. "As a neighbour of Afghanistan, India is naturally concerned about the recent changes in that country and their implications for the region," Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla had said on September 20. He demanded that Afghan territory should not be used for sheltering, training, planning or financing terrorist acts.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-165

Rahul Gandhi, in Kerala for a day, also alleged that it was ‘arrogance’ on the part of the Prime Minister to claim that only he knows or understands India and no one else, especially when he was making the claims without finding out about the culture, language, way of life and problems of the people of the various states and religions. The Congress leader, while speaking at the inauguration of a dialysis centre in Malappuram district of Kerala, said that India was not just a geographical territory, it was the people living here and the relationships they have with each other. “My problem with the Prime Minister is that he is breaking these relationships. If he is breaking the relationships between people of India, then he is shattering the idea of India. That is why I oppose him,” he said. “When he (PM) breaks the relationships between Indians, it is my duty, my job, my commitment to repair the bridges between the people. Every time he uses hatred to break bridges, it is my duty to repair them with love and compassion,” he added. The Congress MP further said that he cannot build the bridges without understanding the different traditions, ideas, religions and cultures in the country and for that one needs to visit the various states and religious places in the country with humility and the willingness to understand. "If I go to these places with arrogance, then I am a fool. How can I go to people of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, who have a history of thousands of years, and claim to know them. I have to go there with humility. Otherwise, how can I define what India is?" "Imagine the arrogance of that person who claims -- 'I know what India is. I know what people of Kerala need. I know what people of Tamil Nadu need'. Imagine the arrogance of such a person who claims that only he knows what India is and what people of India need. This is another problem that I have with Prime Minister Modi. He is convinced nobody understands this land like he does," the Congress leader said. Therefore, the fight here is between humility and arrogance, between temper and compassion, between self-interest and welfare of others, he added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-166

It also asked fishermen who were out in the sea to return to the coast by Wednesday evening. Several parts of south Gujarat and Saurashtra region received heavy rainfall on Tuesday and Wednesday, and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted more widespread showers in the state in the next two days. A few places in Amreli, Bhavnagar, Rajkot and Jamnagar districts of Saurashtra, as well as Anand, Bharuch, among others, likely to receive heavy to very heavy rainfall with isolated extremely heavy rainfall during the next two days, the IMD said in its latest forecast. In a special bulletin issued in the afternoon, the IMD said the remnants of cyclonic storm 'Gulab' lay as a well-marked low-pressure area over south Gujarat region and the adjoining Gulf of Khambhat at 8.30 am on Wednesday. "It is very likely to move west-northwestwards, emerge into the northeast Arabian Sea and intensify into a depression by Thursday. It is then very likely to move further west-northwestwards and intensify into a cyclonic storm during the subsequent 24 hours. Thereafter, it is likely to continue to move west-northwestwards towards Pakistan Makran coast, moving away from the Indian coast," it said. The IMD warned fishermen not to venture into the north Arabian Sea off Gujarat coast from Wednesday to Saturday and suggested total suspension of fishing activities there during the period. It also asked fishermen who were out in the sea to return to the coast and move to safer places by Wednesday evening. Gujarat has so far received 90 per cent of its average annual rainfall, the state's Special Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC) said.

The remarks came days after former Goa chief minister Luizinho Faleiro resigned as Congress MLA, ahead of the state polls due next year. Faleiro is set to join the Trinamul Congress (TMC) in Calcutta on Wednesday in the presence of the party president and Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Talking to PTI, Rao said the TMC was doing exactly the same thing that the BJP did to Mamata Banerjee in Benga". Notably, TMC leader Derek O'Brien recently said that his party would be contesting the Goa Legislative Assembly elections due in February next year. "Trinamul means grassroot, Mamata has worked at the grassroot level and has come up. But, where is the grassroot here (Goa)? This looks like a BJP strategy...of coming to Goa in chartered aircraft, offering bags to people, telling them that we will fund your election if you join us," Rao said. "This is like trying to do what Mamata Didi alleged the BJP (of doing) in Bengal, what they were doing to form government (before the Bengal polls earlier this year), getting ministers, MLAs to defect, she is doing the same thing here," he said. With the Congress's strength reduced to just four MLAs in the 40-member Goa Assembly, Rao denied that the party had left space for others to enter the coastal state. "In 2017 (polls), the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came to Goa. It was more in news that time compared to what Mamata is in the news today. But it is not as simple as that. The Congress had won 17 seats (in the 2017 Goa polls)," Rao said. On the exit of Luizinho Faleiro from the party, Rao termed it as "good riddance". "Not many people have gone with him, not many people have joined him. If you look at response on social media and from the party cadres, everyone is saying good riddance. Good for the party. That is the response we are getting," he added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-166
29-09-2021||India||IAF helicopter rescues three from Latur village amid floods||A day after heavy water discharge from the Manjara dam caused flooding in some places of Maharashtra's Marathwada region, an IAF team on Wednesday rescued three people stranded at an inundated village in Latur with the help of a helicopter, a district administration official said. Following heavy rains in Marathwada over the last few days, the NDRF was mobilised and helicopters were deployed to rescue people stuck in some of the flooded places in the region. On Wednesday morning, a helicopter of the Indian Air Force (IAF) rescued three people, Nagorao Kisan Tikanare (50), his wife Rukmabai (45) and son Chandrakant (11) from Poharegaon village in Renapur tehsil, where they were stranded in the flood, the official said in a release. After heavy showers over the last few days, rains subsided in Latur on Wednesday. Heavy water discharge from the Manjara dam on Tuesday following heavy rains led to flooding in some villages of Beed, Latur and Osmanabad districts in Marathwada, officials earlier said. On Wednesday, 12 out of the total 18 gates of the dam were closed, which reduced the water discharge from the reservoir. In the last two days, at least 13 people died in heavy showers, floods and lightning in parts of Maharashtra with the Marathwada region bearing the major brunt of rain fury, while more than 560 people were rescued after the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) was mobilised and helicopters were deployed, officials said on Tuesday. Besides, more than 200 cattle perished or were washed away and a number of houses were damaged in torrential rains that lashed Marathwada over the last few days, causing havoc in a region which is considered a perennially drought-plagued area, they said. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Tuesday forecast 'extremely heavy rains' at a few places in Marathwada in the next 24 hours. The Marathwada region in central Maharashtra which faced the rain fury comprises eight districts - Aurangabad, Latur, Osmanabad, Parbhani, Nanded, Beed, Jalna and Hingoli.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-166

The curriculum for classes nursery to 12, which was launched at a mega event at Chattrasal stadium on Tuesday, will not have any textbooks. According to officials, the 40-minute classes will be conducted every day for classes six to eight and twice a week for classes nine to 12. "Each class will begin with a five-minute activity called deshbhakti dhyan. During the mediation, students will chant the lines 'I bow before my country and I respect Bharat Mata' through their minds," explained an official of the Directorate of Education (DoE). "The children will then be asked to take a vow to honour their country and preserve its respect. In the end, the students will be asked to think of five people who they consider patriots and thank them in their minds," the official said. The students will be asked to maintain a new notebook or diary as "deshbhakti diary" which will be a reflective journal to document learnings, thoughts and feelings along the journey of the Deshbhakti Curriculum and will have notes related to the homework. The topics include taking responsibility towards the country and its progress, constructive criticism, respect for and harmonious coexistence with others, critically thinking about issues confronting the country, comprehensive conception of patriotism, linking patriotism to the lived realities and everyday actions of students and working for the country's development with pride and honesty. Some of the chapters are: 'My India is glorious but why not developed', 'Deshbhakti: My country my pride', 'Who is a Deshbhakt' and 'India of my dreams'. "Facilitator's handbooks have been designed for three cohorts -- nursery to class five; classes six to eight and classes nine to 12 -- and these will be used to inculcate patriotism among the students through simple activities," the DoE official added. The facilitator's handbooks for two cohorts -- classes six to eight and nine to 12 -- and 100 stories of freedom fighters and patriots were also unveiled at the launch event by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. Describing the homework activities students will be asked to do, the DoE official said, "Students will ask the key question of the chapter to three people older that them- one from their family and two outside of their family. The activity is intended to help children to seek views and opinions of people around them -- adults and acquaintances." "It will encourage them to listen to different views and thoughts of the people around them about the country, enhance the expanse of discussion and broaden student perspective," the official added. The students will also participate in Flag Day activity as part of the curriculum. "The activity is aimed to establish a connect between students' behaviours and the country. The idea is to make students realise that every act of theirs makes the country's flag happy or sad. Each student will make his or her own flag at the start of the curriculum," the official said. The teachers' handbooks come with a set of "dos and don'ts" for conducting these classes they have been instructed not to criticise children's answers to which they do not agree and not to present their personal thoughts or opinions as the correct answer; not to stop children from asking questions or cut them off and to listen to them with patience; not to stop discussions on sensitive topics or present their own views and let children form their own thoughts through the discussion. The chief minister had announced the plan for Deshbhakti Curriculum on the 73rd Independence Day celebrations in 2019. The curriculum has been prepared by Delhi government school teachers, with inputs from NGO partners and experts. Sisodia said at the launch event on Tuesday that since this is the first year (of the curriculum) and "we are celebrating the 75th anniversary of Independence, we are including 100 patriots". "Next year onwards, we will include 100 more and then another hundred after that. This would go on and on. Right from nursery to class 12, a child will be able to witness at least 700-800 stories and 500-600 patriotic songs and poems," he had said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-166
29-09-2021||India||Day after quitting abruptly, Sidhu questions appointment of Punjab DGP and advocate general||Breaking his silence a day after abruptly resigning as the Punjab Congress chief, Navot Singh Sidhu on Wednesday raised questions over the appointments of the director-general of police and the state's advocate general. Plunging the Congress into a fresh crisis months ahead of the assembly elections in the state, Sidhu put in his papers on Tuesday shortly after the allocation of portfolios to the new ministers of the Charanjit Singh Channi cabinet. Taking to Twitter a day later, Sidhu said his objective had always been to improve the lives of people and to make a difference. "My fight is for the issues and an agenda of Punjab," he said in an over four-minute video clip shared on his Twitter handle. Apparently referring to senior IPS officer Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota, who has been given the additional charge of the director general of Punjab Police, Sidhu said, "When I see those who gave clean chit to Badals six years back such persons have been given the responsibility for delivering justice." Sahota was the head of a special investigation team formed in 2015 by the then Akali government to probe the sacrilege incidents. Sidhu also apparently questioned the appointment of A P S Deol as the state's new advocate general. "Those who secured blanket bails, they are advocate general," he said. Deol is a senior advocate of the Punjab and Haryana High Court and has been a counsel for former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini. He had been representing the ex-top cop in various cases against him. "My fight is issue-based and I have stood by it for a long time. There can't be any compromise on a pro-Punjab agenda. I can never misguide the high command nor allow it to be misguided," Sidhu further said in the video. "I will make any sacrifice to stand by principles. I don't need to think much for it. I broke the system where tainted ministers and officers were accommodated. Now tainted ministers and officers can't be appointed again. I oppose such appointments," he added, before saying that he won't accept the induction of tainted ministers in the Punjab cabinet. Sidhu’s sudden decision to resign not only intensified the problems of the ruling Congress in poll-bound Punjab, it also caused deep embarrassment to Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as they had taken a huge risk by bulldozing all hurdles to project him as the supreme leader in the state. The majority of senior leaders in the high command structure had not been in favour of promoting Sidhu but Rahul and Priyanka appeared to have been swayed by his popularity in their effort to retain Punjab in the next election. Sidhu wrote in his resignation letter: “The collapse of a man’s character stems from the compromise corner. I can never compromise on Punjab’s future and the agenda for the welfare of Punjab. Therefore, I hereby resign as the president of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee. I will continue to serve the Congress.” Sources said that while Sidhu was upset because he wanted to become chief minister after Amarinder’s exit, his anger boiled over when new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi made appointments without his approval. Sidhu’s supporters said the cabinet too wasn’t formed with his full consent and certain other appointments were seen by him as a compromise with corruption.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-166

"We are of the view that the contemnor is clearly guilty of contempt of court and his action to scandalise the court cannot be countenanced," the top court said. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh said the chairperson of NGO, Suraz India Trust, Rajiv Daiya has been "throwing mud" at all and sundry including the court, administrative staff and the state government. "The power to punish for contempt is a constitutional power vested with this court which cannot be taken away even by a legislative enactment," the court said. The top court issued notice to Daiya and directed him to be present on October 7 for hearing of the sentence. With regard to recovery of money, the bench said it can take place as arrears of land revenue. The top court had issued contempt notice to Daiya as to why he should not be proceeded against and sentenced for his endeavour to scandalise the court. Daiya had told the bench that he did not have the resources to pay the costs imposed by the apex court and would approach the President of India with a mercy plea. The apex court was hearing an application filed by Daiy seeking recall of the apex court's 2017 judgement by which it had imposed costs of Rs 25 lakh on it for filing 64 PILs over the years without any success and "repeatedly misusing" the jurisdiction of the top court.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-166

Local resident Rajkumar Yadav went to the civic-run medical centre in Kalwa area here on Monday to get a jab against the coronavirus infection.

The man panicked, but he is fine and has no complications, the official said. He later complained to authorities and based on a preliminary enquiry, a woman doctor, who was in-charge of the medical centre, and a nurse were placed under suspension for the goof-up, the official said. The medical centre, located in a slum colony of Kalwa, provides vaccination against various diseases to people in the area.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-166
29-09-2021||India||Kanhaiya Kumar answers why he chose to join Congress||Kanhaiya Kumar, whose rousing call for “azadi” on the Jawaharlal Nehru University campus in March 2016 had catapulted him to the forefront of the ideological struggle in the country, joined the Congress on Tuesday with the assertion that it is the only party equipped to lead that struggle. “India today needs the valour of Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh, the equality of Babasaheb Ambedkar and the unity of Mahatma Gandhi,” Kanhaiya said, addressing a news conference at the party headquarters along with fellow youth leader Jignesh Mevani. “The Congress is the party that will take forward Gandhi’s legacy, Sarojini Naidu’s ideals, and follow the path of Ambedkar, Nehru, Ashfaqullah Khan, Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh and Maulana Azad. When we talk of equality, it is not limited to some individuals, it is the history of being an Indian and if there is any party that encompasses this within itself, it is the Congress,” he said. The entry of Kanhaiya, seen as the country’s most promising young politician, and firebrand activist Jignesh is a powerful political message that underlines the Congress’s credentials as the most formidable force that can stop the Sangh parivar juggernaut. Both Kanhaiya and Jignesh, who is an Independent MLA and a Dalit rights activist, have risen from the grassroots by the dint of their talent and sustained struggle against the State’s might. Out of 545 seats in the Lok Sabha, in 200 there is no party against the BJP other than the Congress, Kanhaiya said, adding that if the big ship drowns, so will the smaller boats. The Congress has to survive for the country to survive and for the aspirations of the youths to survive, he said. “Many of my friends have not correctly figured out the nature of the battle in their political imagination. They are still obsessed with protecting their political ‘showrooms’. When a mall is on fire, you don’t try to save individual shops,” he said, calling for the breaking down of narrow political walls in the bigger ideological battle. While he said this in response to a question about his decision to move from the Left to the Congress, it was a message for the wider Opposition. “The Congress is the oldest and most democratic party,” Kanhaiya said, daring the media to question him about dynasty, which no one did. The Indian identity, that of Buddha, Kabir and Nanak, and of the courage to question power in every era, is under threat, he said. Referring to the “dance on a corpse” in Assam, Kanhaiya stressed the urgency of saving the idea of India, the India of Gandhi’s, Ambedkar’s and Bhagat Singh’s dreams. Shouldn’t every organisation in the country have portraits of these three leaders, Kanhaiya asked. The Indian ethos was such that if there was a death in a village, the whole village would not eat. Now, after lakhs of Indians died of Covid, there was a celebration for the Prime Minister’s birthday, he added. “Who your friends are will get automatically decided once you choose your enemy. The people who are in power now are vitiating India’s intellectual tradition, its culture, core values, its history, its present and its future,” he said. Although his decision to join the Congress has created heartburn within the CPI and Left circles, Kanhaiya expressed his gratitude to the party he was “born” in. “They taught me, trained me, gave me the fighting spirit,” he said, but stressed that this was a time to shed differences and fight for the country and the Congress as the biggest Opposition party was leading the battle. “Everyone should come together because the country belongs to all of us.” Kanhaiya thanked the citizens who are fighting the ideological battle with friends and family in WhatsApp groups and at dinner tables. This is a time of urgency, he said, and called upon the youths not to sit on the fence wondering which way to go but to fight with all they had. “I was a member of the AISF (All-India Students’ Federation) till yesterday,” Kanhaiya said. “The inaugural session of the AISF in 1936 was addressed by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru,” he added, stressing that all youths fighting for India’s freedom had come together irrespective of their ideologies. “We are back to the pre-1947 situation.” An orator who combines historical perspective with clarity of thought and wit, Kanhaiya offered glimpses of this at the news conference. He thanked the media for at least questioning the Opposition so that people would remember that the job of the media was to ask questions. He also promised to answer every question “because I am not the Prime Minister”. Jignesh, who has not joined the party formally because he is an Independent MLA, declared that he was aligned with the Congress family and ideology and would fight the next election in Gujarat on a Congress ticket. “The entire nation has been witness to the havoc that originated in Gujarat. India never faced such a crisis; the Constitution is under attack, the idea of India is being demolished. There is a conspiracy to spread the poison of hate to break the society. “When I introspect what should be my foremost responsibility under these circumstances, the answer I get is to do whatever I can to save the Constitution. And where should I stand in this critical battle? With the party that led the freedom struggle,” he said. Although Rahul Gandhi was not present at the news conference, the former Congress president accompanied Kanhaiya, Jignesh and Gujarat working president Hardik Patel to garland the statue of Bhagat Singh in Delhi’s Shaheed Park on his birth anniversary. A large crowd was mobilised. No other leader in recent memory has been welcomed into the party with a special event like this. “In the empire of lies, it is truth that brings revolution. New and old comrades will have to together participate in this satyagraha,” Rahul tweeted in Hindi, posting a photograph from the Shaheed Park event.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-167
29-09-2021||India||Sentinels call to fortify frontiers with Pakistan and China ||The top brass of the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) have requested the Union home ministry to raise additional battalions to fortify the frontiers with Pakistan and China amid heightened tension along the two borders, sources in the two forces have told The Telegraph. ITBP guards the 3,488km Line of Actual Control with China while the BSF is deployed at the International Border with Pakistan and also at the Bangladesh frontier that runs through Bengal, Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya and Mizoram. Indian and Chinese armies have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May last year. Indian security agencies are also concerned over infiltration bids from Pakistan and the spike in incidents of Pakistani drones entering Indian territory to drop arms, ammunition, drugs and money to fuel terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. “We need more battalions and have requested the Union home ministry to look into our proposal,” said a BSF official. Sources in the ministry said the two border-guarding forces felt that additional battalions were needed to ensure better patrolling in sensitive areas. Sources in the security establishment have hinted at a collusive threat from Pakistan and China amid the border standoff in eastern Ladakh. The latest intelligence report has suggested that Chinese troops were conducting joint patrols with Pakistan’s army in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and Beijing is helping set up multiple surface-to-air missile launch sites and a missile defence system in the region.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-167
29-09-2021||India||Punjab: Sidhu abruptly resigns as state Congress president||Navjot Singh Sidhu on Tuesday abruptly sent in his resignation from the post of Punjab Congress president, days after the party removed entrenched leader Amarinder Singh as chief minister following a tussle between the two. Sidhu’s sudden decision not only intensified the problems of the ruling Congress in poll-bound Punjab, it also caused deep embarrassment to Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as they had taken a huge risk by bulldozing all hurdles to project him as the supreme leader in the state. The majority of senior leaders in the high command structure had not been in favour of promoting Sidhu but Rahul and Priyanka appeared to have been swayed by his popularity in their effort to retain Punjab in the next election. Sidhu wrote in his resignation letter: “The collapse of a man’s character stems from the compromise corner. I can never compromise on Punjab’s future and the agenda for the welfare of Punjab. Therefore, I hereby resign as the president of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee. I will continue to serve the Congress.” He posted the letter on Twitter without clearance from the central leadership, sources said. The sources said that while Sidhu was upset because he wanted to become chief minister after Amarinder’s exit, his anger boiled over when new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi made appointments without his approval. Sidhu’s supporters said the cabinet too wasn’t formed with his full consent and certain other appointments were seen by him as a compromise with corruption. Channi said on Tuesday that he would meet Sidhu and sort out the matter. Even Sidhu’s aides were huddled with him to resolve the crisis, trying to persuade him to withdraw the resignation keeping in mind the larger picture, particularly the Assembly elections next year. But the dominant sentiment in the party is hostile towards Sidhu with most leaders condemning his “immaturity” as “unpardonable betrayal”. The sources claimed that even Rahul was livid. While Amarinder asserted that Sidhu was not a “stable personality”, most other senior leaders said Sidhu should have considered the risks Rahul and Priyanka had taken for him. They believe the Congress should persist with the pro-Dalit narrative in the aftermath of Channi’s elevation by discarding Sidhu and immediately appointing someone else as the state unit chief. These leaders are of the opinion that dilly-dallying will further complicate the web that the party looks stuck in. A senior leader told The Telegraph: “Sidhu is now raking up small issues without realising the overarching goal of winning the election. The main issue is that he feels the chief minister is not willing to be a puppet. “He was already feeling let down because of the choice of Channi. But he felt he could act as super chief minister and wanted to be projected as the next chief minister in the election. There were no signs of capitulation by the high command to this kind of blackmail. Rahul Gandhi was determined to give Channi a chance to prove his leadership.” Another leader from Chandigarh said: “Rahul Gandhi took a great decision by setting the electoral discourse. The anti-incumbency factor got wiped away and everybody was discussing the Dalit factor. Sidhu was rattled by that because he is driven by his overweening ambition. If the party tries to strike any compromise with him and runs the risk of undermining Channi’s authority, the whole atmosphere will get vitiated. We have to forget Sidhu and persist with the Dalit card.” Channi is Punjab’s first Dalit chief minister. There have been some resignations in solidarity with Sidhu but leaders prefer a courageous response to weather this storm. Cabinet minister Razia Sultana, whose husband Mohd Mustafa is Sidhu’s adviser, resigned along with some party office-bearers. Around six MLAs visited Sidhu’s residence but that is not being seen as a real threat to the Channi government. The majority of the MLAs support a tough line and a prompt decision to end the perception of instability. Asked about Sidhu’s principled stand on zero tolerance on corruption, a Congress MP said: “Isn’t Rahul Gandhi committed to fighting corruption? If Sidhu had some concerns, he could have patiently dealt with it. There was a strong momentum in favour of the Congress and he consciously derailed it. If he is sulking at the personal level, he can’t harm the party. Is he sitting in a comedy circus? Politics is a serious business and the central leadership cannot afford to give him a second chance.” Some leaders have already conveyed to the high command that Sidhu’s popularity had been severely dented over the past few days because of his perceived arrogance and ambition. “He has become a subject of ridicule. Even common people are saying he is not a serious politician. He is seen as disinterested in letting a Dalit leader flourish. The party must close this chapter and move ahead without losing a single day,” a young leader from Punjab said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-167
29-09-2021||India||Telangana and Meghalaya seek additional foodgrain for migrants||No state barring Telangana and Meghalaya has so far sought additional foodgrain from the Centre for providing free rations to migrant workers in pursuance of a Supreme Court judgment in June, an RTI reply has revealed. While the information need not mean migrants across the country are being denied grains — some states like Bengal are providing such help to the needy from their own resources — the lack of response does raise the question whether a bottleneck exists somewhere in the chain. According to RTI activist Anjali Bharadwaj, information obtained under the Right to Information Act from the department of food and public distribution of the central government shows that despite the Supreme Court order, no tangible provisions have been put in place to provide free rations to migrant workers who do not possess ration cards. On June 29, 2021, in a case the Supreme Court had taken up suo motu, it had issued several directives to ensure food security for migrant and unorganised sector workers. “Information accessed under the RTI Act shows that the central and state governments have failed to comply with these directions,” Bharadwaj told The Telegraph. She said she had filed the RTI application with the Centre’s food and public distribution department seeking the following information. ⚫  The names of states that have sought additional dry foodgrain from the central government for disbursement among migrant labourers. ⚫  Copies of the letters/ communication/ correspondence through which the foodgrain had been sought. ⚫  Details of the quantity of additional foodgrain allocated by the Centre to each state government in August 2021. The reply stated that only the state governments of Telangana and Meghalaya had sought additional foodgrain from the Centre for providing rations to migrant labourers in pursuance of the apex court judgment. According to Bharadwaj, the department refused to furnish the correspondence on grains for migrants, claiming such information was exempt under Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act that pertains to information held in a fiduciary capacity. She said this was a violation of the RTI Act. On her plea seeking details of the allocations made to the states and Union Territories, the RTI reply stated that “so far no additional allocation of foodgrains has been made by this department to any state government” other than those of Telangana and Meghalaya. Bharadwaj had filed another RTI application with the department seeking details of the steps taken to implement the directive of the Supreme Court regarding re-determining coverage under the National Food Security Act. The reply states: “...Any revision in the State/UT-wise coverage shall be possible after the data of next census.…” Bharadwaj said: “This means that the government is looking at any revision only in 2023-24 when the next census is likely to be published. This would defeat the very purpose of the judgment.” In June, the Supreme Court had directed the Centre and the states to ensure that the National Database for Unorganised Workers (NDUW Project), as well as various public distribution system schemes for unorganised and migrant labourers, are implemented by all means by July 31, 2021, including the policy of “one-nation-one-ration-card” for such beneficiaries. The court had also said the Centre must provide additional foodgrain to the states and Union Territories upon the latter’s demand for implementing the special schemes for the unorganised and migrant labourers. A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan (since retired) and M.R. Shah had passed the following directives while disposing of a batch of applications filed by the NGO Bandhua Mukti Morcha and others seeking relief for unorganised sector workers and migrant labourers, who had borne the brunt of the pandemic: ⚫ The central government must develop a portal on the National Database for Unorganised Workers (NDUW Project) in consultation with the National Informatics Centre for the registration of unorganised labourers and migrant workers. The Centre as well as the states and Union Territories must complete the process of setting up the portal not later than July 31, 2021. ⚫ The registration of unorganised labourers and migrant workers is to be completed at the earliest, but not later than December 31, 2021. The states and Union Territories and the licence holders and contractors will have to cooperate with the central government to complete the process of registration so that the benefits of the welfare schemes reach the beneficiaries. ⚫ The Centre is to allocate additional dry foodgrain as demanded by the states and Union Territories for distribution among migrant labourers.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-167
29-09-2021||India||Women lawyers complain to SCBA for being kept away from event||A group of 54 women lawyers on Tuesday complained to the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) that several female lawyers were kept away from the September 26 event organised by the “Lady Advocates of the Supreme Court” to felicitate nine new judges  recent elevated to the Supreme Court. Addressed to SCBA president Vikas Singh, the letter stated: “While we were all eagerly looking forward to meet the Hon'ble CJI and the new judges and especially the historic strength of lady judges and express our appreciation and welcome them all, most of us had no knowledge of such an event taking place. “This function has been videographed and circulated in several WhatsApp groups and YouTube and therefore available on social media and we also came to know about it from the same. It has also received wide publicity in print media…. This function was declared to be hosted by ‘Lady Advocates of Supreme Court of India’ and was graced by the Hon'ble Judges.” The letter added: “We are constrained to write to you in response to an observation by the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India where he says he was disappointed to see such a thin crowd and that he expected 200–300 lady advocates to be present…. Clearly, the Hon'ble CJI is well aware of the strength of the lady advocate members practising before the Supreme Court of India, and accordingly, he was rightly disappointed without being aware that most of the lady lawyers regularly practising in the Supreme Court had no knowledge of the event and were not even informed or invited by the organizers.” The letter urged Singh to clarify whether the felicitation had the patronage of the SCBA or the SCAORA (Supreme Court Advocates on Records Association) and whether information regarding this felicitation was circulated amongst its members or if it was a purely private event. “If it was a private event, it appears that an impression was conveyed to the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India and his brother and sister Judges by the host(s) of this function that this is an official function representative of ladies practising before this Hon'ble Court. The same is evident from the speech of the Hon'ble CJI and the hosts. “Please do indicate to us as to whether there are any guidelines with respect to such private functions masquerading as official functions… and whether such activities based on false representation to the Hon'ble Judges must be deprecated and what the SCBA plans to do about it. Will the SCBA watch silently while its EC members use their official position to carry out private activities to the exclusion of the bar members?” the letter asked. The signatories to the letter included advocates Indra Sawhney, Sushma Suri and Anil Katiyar.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-167
29-09-2021||India||Gadkari advances 'Asia’s largest tunnel' deadline by two years ||Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday advanced by two years the deadline for completion of “Asia’s largest tunnel” at Zojila, that will provide an all-weather road to Ladakh, apparently turning the project into a pitch for 2024 Lok Sabha polls amid allegations that the promise of development in Jammu and Kashmir has remained elusive under the BJP-led central government. “It is Asia’s longest tunnel and after reviewing the work (today), they (company engaged in its construction) have promised me that they are trying to complete the project by 2023-end, that is one-and-a-half years to two years earlier. This is not a commitment. This is a target,” Gadkari told reporters. The Union minister for road transport and highways was here on a two-day visit to review the progress of various development works. In a lighter vein later, the minister said the official target for Zojila tunnel is 2026 but seeing the progress he can say that the project can be completed by December 2023. “This is the target we have set because we have an election in 2024,” he said. Gadkari said they are trying to hasten the project “without compromising on the quality” and are using “world’s best technology” to complete the tunnel. Various central governments have set ambitious targets for high-profile projects in Jammu and Kashmir but they have rarely been met. The world’s highest railway bridge, being built at a height of 359 metres above the river bed, was originally planned to be completed in 2009 but 12 years later it remains incomplete. The government is constructing the strategically important Z-Morh and Zojila tunnels on the Srinagar-Kargil highway, which will provide all-season road link to Ladakh. The length of the Z-Morh tunnel is 6.5km. The National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation, which is constructing the twin tunnels, put the length of Zojila at 14.15km but the minister said it was 13.5km.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-167
29-09-2021||India||Debate over image of Bhagat Singh used in Delhi and Punjab govt ads||Archivist Chaman Lal, honorary adviser to the Bhagat Singh Archives and Resource Centre here, has rued the use of an “unreal painting” of the freedom fighter to mark his 114th birth anniversary on Tuesday. However, former Union minister and chief election commissioner M.S. Gill insisted that the use of the turbaned image was ideal to celebrate Singh’s legacy as the more recognised photo of the freedom fighter wearing a hat was merely a disguise to evade arrest. There are four known photographs of Singh, who was born in West Punjab’s Banga village in 1907 — him as an 11-year-old, as a 17-year-old in a turban at Lahore’s National College, in custody at Lahore railway police station in 1927 where he is seen with his hair tied in a bun, and in trimmed hair and wearing a hat. The last picture had been clicked at the studio of photographer Sham Lal in 1929 before Singh hurled a bomb at the Central Legislative Assembly. However, the Punjab and Delhi state governments have in advertisements commemorating Singh’s birth anniversary used a painting of him wearing a yellow turban. Lal said the painting had little physical resemblance to Singh. Several other versions, including one in which Singh brandishes a revolver, are widely used. “Till the 70s, the photo with the hat was the most popular. With the rise of identity politics in the 70s, the yellow turbaned image was popularised as an assertion of his Jat Sikh identity —something which Bhagat Singh himself never stressed on,” Lal said. “In fact, being from a Congress family, he and his kin wore white turbans and khadi clothes, which was the trademark of those in the national movement at the time. I don’t know why the Congress betrays its own legacy with its leaders now wearing the yellow turban in his memory,” the archivist added. The Bhagat Singh Archives and Resource Centre, which functions under the Delhi government, circulated a booklet among officials on Monday with three of the original photos. However, both the Punjab and the Delhi governments brought out ads on Tuesday with the portrait of Singh in a yellow turban. Assembly elections are due in Punjab next year and Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party has been promoting the yellow turban worn in the style of the painting with its MP Bhagwant Mann always sporting it in Parliament. The AAP is a key player in Punjab, ruled by the Congress. London-based Punjabi author Amarjit Chandan, also a scholar on Bhagat Singh iconography, said Congress chief minister Giani Zail Singh had unveiled a statue of the freedom fighter wearing the hat in Khatkar Kalan — Singh’s ancestral village — in 1973. A bronze turbaned statue now stands at the spot, a change Chandan attributed to Gill who was principal secretary to Akali chief minister Parkash Singh Badal from 1978 to 80. Gill said he had no recollection of the 1973 statue or replacing it. He objected to Youth Congress banners on Tuesday with the hat photo. “Bhagat Singh is a hat that fits all heads, from the Far Left to the Far Right. His ties to the Arya Samaj and work as a revolutionary are claimed by the Right wing, his Marxist writings by the Left, and his Sikh family heritage by the Sikh parties. An RSS man or a Khalistani may simply ignore Bhagat Singh’s Why I am an Atheist (written in Lahore Central Jail before his execution in 1931),” Chandan said. He added: “The turban controversy is absurd. All males in the Punjab — Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs — wore turbans before Partition.” Gill, who later became a Congress MP, was instrumental in establishing a museum in Khatkar Kalan in 1981 and acquiring archival material on the freedom fighter for the Punjab government as an IAS officer. He said he installed the first turbaned bronze statue of Singh at Ludhiana’s Bhandari Bridge in 1979. “All hell broke loose in Punjab after the statue was unveiled. The Arya Samaj-controlled press started screaming, ‘how can a bloody IAS officer play politics?’ Of course, I was playing politics…. ‘Ab Bhagat Singh ko pagdi baandh diya, jisko dum hai utaar ke dekho (I have draped Bhagat Singh in a turban, let anyone who dares remove it),’ is what I said,” Gill said. He added: “Arya Samajis projected him as a hat-wearing Bollywood-ish gunda. He was from a Jat Sikh Sandhu family that wore turbans. He is seen in photos with long hair and a turban. The hat was a disguise. Netaji (Subhas Chandra) Bose escaped to Kabul in the guise of a Pathan. Is he honoured as a Pathan?” Gill was also instrumental in canvassing support and ensuring the installation of Singh’s statue in Parliament in 2008. “It was mostly Sikhs who were sent to the Cellular Jail and mostly Sikhs who were hanged for the freedom struggle. I asked (then Lok Sabha Speaker) Somnath Chatterjee, how is it that no Sikh has a statue here?” The freedom fighter’s family complained that the turbaned statue, created by master sculptor Ram V. Sutar, at Parliament resembled a middle-aged man whereas Singh was hanged when he was just 23. Lal pointed out that contemporary images of other Punjabi freedom fighters Udham Singh and Kartar Singh Sarabha also don’t often resemble them as they are shown with beards. However, their photographs show them clean-shaven. Singh’s nephew and academic Jagmohan Singh chairs the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Centenary Foundation in Khatkar Kalan which recently installed statues of Bhagat Singh, Shivaram Rajguru and Sukhdev Thapar, who were executed for killing police officer John Saunders in 1928. “These statues celebrate the centenary year of the Naujawan Bharat Sabha, which was Bhagat Singh’s youth movement during which time he wore a turban. Those using either the hat image or the turbaned one must explain why they do so. Bhagat Singh was clear that his movement was to rise above divisions of caste and religion and bring about equality in society,” Jagmohan Singh said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-167
29-09-2021||India||Amarinder Singh’s 'personal' trip to Delhi triggers speculation||Former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh’s “personal” trip to Delhi on Tuesday triggered speculation over the possibility of the miffed Congress veteran embracing the BJP as his current party struggles to set its house in order in the election-bound state. The murmurs started in the morning, even before his arch rival Navjot Singh Sidhu resigned as Punjab Congress president. Many conjectured that Amarinder was in Delhi to meet Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president J.P. Nadda. With the claims not substantiated by hard facts, Amarinder’s media adviser Raveen Thukral tried to counter the “unnecessary speculation” but in the process ended up fanning the rumours by not putting out a firm denial. “Too much being read into @capt_amarinder’s visit to Delhi. He’s on a personal visit during which he’ll meet some friends and also vacate the Kapurthala house for the new CM,” Thukral tweeted. “No need for any unnecessary speculation,” he added. The BJP was tight-lipped but sources didn’t rule out a meeting of Amarinder with Shah and Nadda. “There is no such meeting scheduled but politicians keep meeting each other. What is big in it?” one BJP leader said. Internally, BJP leaders felt that the 79-year-old Amarinder may not be of much use to the party given its unofficial retirement age of 75 but could be valuable in terms of harming its principal rival, the Congress. “In Punjab we don’t have much strength as we had banked on the Akali Dal in the state. Amarinder can add some strength during the upcoming polls if he joins us,” a BJP general secretary said. The Shiromani Akali Dal, a long-time ally of the BJP, snapped ties last year over the farm laws. BJP insiders said Amarinder being an old guard, had good relations with many senior party leaders. Amarinder, old-timers said, had a close relationship with late Arun Jaitley. “I don’t know about his equations with Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi or Amit Shah but he had been meeting both of them as chief minister,” one BJP leader said. “His (Amarinder’s) deep dislike for Sidhu, however, can take him to any extent,” the leader added, hoping that Amarinder would try to join the BJP to strike back at Sidhu and also the new Congress leadership of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-167

At a virtual meeting held on Monday under the chairmanship of Sanjay Kumar Singh, Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner-cum-chief executive officer of Bhubaneswar Smart City and BDA vice-chairman, market leaders in EV infrastructure in India and other senior officials from various stakeholders deliberated on the need of setting up EV charging infrastructure. The meeting discussed the EV charging stations to be built across the city to be used by the people and public transport vehicles in the near future. The priority on selection of locations will be given mainly to malls, public parking lots, hotels, residential complexes, workplaces and highways. The city is planning to add a fleet of electric buses to its public transport network. In the first phase, the city will have seven EV charging stations at KIIT area (one fast charger and one slow charger), SUM Hospital (one slow charger), near Esplanade Mall, Rasulgarh (one fast charger and one slow charger), D.N. Regalia (one slow charger) and Krishna Plaza CRP Square (one slow charger). Later, more such facilities will be added. During the meeting, different EV vehicle infrastructure adopted by other cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Jaipur were discussed. N. Mohan, general manager (EV and EV charging infrastructure), Energy Efficiency Services Limited, Sandeep Bangia, Tata Power Company Limited head (EV and home automation business), senior officials from the state energy and commerce and transport departments, M.

How long can we go on doing so? Hum log thak gaye hain (We are tired). We cannot go on raising the demand anvarat (indefinitely),” said Vijendra Yadav, a former state JDU president and a cabinet member, in reply to queries from journalists about the demand on Monday. He shrugged at questions that the stance might cause the JDU to face criticism from the Opposition, given Nitish’s proclaimed commitment to securing special category status for Bihar. The Congress lashed out at the JDU for the comment saying it exposed the “duplicity” of the party on the issue. “Now it is clear that special category status was just a political stunt for the JDU. It never meant business. We will expose the party before the people,” AICC media panellist and MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said. Nitish, an NDA ally, had raised many eyebrows when he had said before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls that he would support “any government” that promised to grant the status to Bihar.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-167

After being elected president, Dr Sanjukta Mohapatra, former principal of Sailabala Women’s Autonomous College, Cuttack, said her focus would be to make the club more accessible to women and to create a healthy environment for the women members. The club has more than 1,700 members including judges of the Supreme Court, high court, senior bureaucrats, educationists, doctors and other personalities. Dr Mohapatra told The Telegraph: “I am excited on being elected as the president. The club was established by Britishers and no woman has ever occupied the post. The women come to the club as spouses and take either dinner and lunch and leave the club premises. Henceforth, we will engage them in different works. With my new team, I will try to bring in reforms in the club structure and will implement my vision for the development of the prestigious club. I will focus on ladies’ activities.” The former principal said she would create a separate directory for the members. On the other hand, the Bhubaneswar Club, considered the de facto power centre of Odisha, has elected Asit Tripathy, former chief secretary, chairman of the Western Odisha Development Corporation and adviser to the chief minister, as its president. The high-profile election saw Tripathy locking horns with Bijay Patnaik, former chief secretary, former principal secretary to the chief minister and a key member of the Naveen Patnaik government in 2010-13. Tripathy won by 278 votes. The election seems to have made it clear that Bijay, a part of the old guard, no longer enjoys the clout which he used to a decade ago. Vishal Dev, secretary, finance, and a key member of the state bureaucracy, has been elected as the secretary of the club. “Its understood that the election has the stamp of approval of the chief minister’s office. Without its support, these two members would not have been elected. We had felt the heat of the election which was more than that of a general election,” said a key member of the club. The Bhubaneswar Club, which was established in 1949, has more than 3,000 members and is affiliated to 180 clubs across the country. Tripathy told the media that he would work towards the dream of making it a multi-dimensional club. Elections were pending following the demise of the club’s former president, Priyabrata Patnaik, and the subsequent pandemic.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-168
