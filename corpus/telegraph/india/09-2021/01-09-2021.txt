The CBI Wednesday also questioned lawyer Anand Daga for allegedly trying to pay "illegal gratification" a sub-inspector-rank officer of the agency to "subvert the preliminary enquiry", they said,  A report of preliminary enquiry purportedly giving clean chit to Deshmukh was leaked Saturday night.  The CBI started a probe into the leakage which has so far revealed that Deshmukh's team allegedly tried to influence the conduct of PE against him by paying illegal gratification to a sub-inspector ranked officer of the agency, the officials said.  The central agency Wednesday examined Deshmukh's son-in-law Gaurav Chaturvedi and lawyer Anand Daga in over its probe after which an FIR was registered, they said.  The CBI did not find Chaturvedi's involvement so far and he was allowed to go, they said.  "Attempt of Anil Deshmukh's team were in contempt of Bombay High Court which had directed that all concerned should fully cooperate with the CBI while conducting the PE. In this case it has appeared that Deshmukh's team tried to subvert the PE," an official told PTI.  Their attempt could not succeed as there is a procedure in the CBI in which evidences on record and legal opinion is also taken on record before the registration of the FIR, he said.  "They could not influence people at higher level," he said.  The CBI had started a PE on the orders of the Bombay High Court which had issued the direction while hearing a public interest litigation on allegations of corruption against Deshmukh.  The claimed PE findings which were leaked showed the Deputy SP probing the matter had purportedly opined that no cognisable offence was made out against Deshmukh.  It was later converted into an FIR based on a contrasting opinion of the Deputy SP. The opinion mentioned in the FIR said that cognisable offence is made out against Deshmukh.  "The Preliminary Enquiry prima facie revealed that a cognisable offence is made out in the matter, wherein the then Home minister of Maharashtra, Shri Anil Deshmukh and unknown others have attempted to obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of their public duty," the CBI FIR alleged.  In the FIR, the CBI had booked Deshmukh and others unidentified under IPC sections related to criminal conspiracy and section of Prevention of Corruption Act for "attempt to obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of public duty."  Allegations against Deshmukh had surfaced after the removal of Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh.  He was removed after the role of a policemen Sachin Waze surfaced into the case of an explosive-laden SUV which was found parked outside the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani. Waze was arrested by the NIA.  In his letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, after his removal, Singh had alleged Deshmukh had asked Waze to extort over Rs 100 crore a month from bars and restaurants of Mumbai, they said.  The FIR alleged that Deshmukh "and others" exercised undue influence over the transfer and posting of officials.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-250
01-09-2021||India||Haryana govt shifts Karnal SDM days after his 'break heads' remark||The Haryana government on Wednesday transferred 19 IAS officers, including Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha, who was recently caught on tape allegedly telling policemen dealing with a farmers' protest to "break their heads".  Sinha will now be the additional secretary of the Citizen Resources Information Department, a government order said, adding that he has been shifted against a vacant post.  Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had earlier admitted that the choice of words by Ayush Sinha, a 2018-batch IAS officer, was wrong but had defended the police action.  Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala had also disapproved of his remark and promised action against Sinha amid mounting opposition attack against his government over the lathicharge on farmers.  The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farmers' outfits spearheading the stir against the Centre's farm laws, had said a murder case should be registered against Sinha and he be dismissed from service.  The Morcha had fixed September 6 as the deadline to meet its demands while threatening to lay siege to the Karnal mini-secretariat.  A Congress delegation led by the Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, on Tuesday submitted to the Governor a video of the official, in which he is seen telling police to break the farmers' heads.  Submitting a memorandum, Hooda had reiterated his demand for a judicial inquiry by a sitting judge of the High Court or a retired judge into the lathicharge incident, in which around 10 farmers were injured.  Police had used force on the protesters at Bastara toll plaza when farmers allegedly tried to march towards the venue of the a BJP meeting, in which the chief minister and other senior BJP leaders from the state were present.  Meanwhile, among other IAS officers transferred include Varinder Singh Kundu, Additional Chief Secretary to Haryana government, Labour Department. He has been posted as the ACS, Employment Department.  S N Roy, ACS, Urban Local Bodies Department, will now be ACS, Forests and Wildlife Department, relieving G Anupama of the charge.  Raja Sekhar Vundru, ACS, Skill Development and Industrial Training Department, will now be the ACS, Labour Department, relieving V S Kundu of the charge.  The Haryana government also issued transfer and posting orders of one HCS officer.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-250
01-09-2021||India|| Sonia Gandhi to decide on Prashant Kishor's induction in Congress||Congress chief Sonia Gandhi will take a final call on the induction of election strategist Prashant Kishor in the party after a series of meetings with senior leaders, many of whom are opposed to the idea, sources told NDTV today. Kishor, who had a botched stint with Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United), had a series of meetings with the three Gandhis in July, where a role for him in the party was explored in detail. Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi worked with Kishor in the run-up to the last Uttar Pradesh elections and sources say they have no objection to his joining the party. But the party's senior leaders are divided over the recruitment, with some keen, saying it would be good optics for the party. Others say the wild card entry will not make a difference and the Gandhis must be ready to listen and engage with party leaders and workers, which they have stopped doing. Kishor had shared a list of plans to be implemented by the party from public rallies, opposition get-together's and a host of other not-so-suitable plans for the Congress. "Prashant Kishor has no magic wand," said one leader who doesn't belong to the dissenting group. The election strategist, he said, might also find it difficult to adapt to the culture and approach of the party. After the death of Ahmed Patel, interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi has been searching for advisers to help resurrect the party, which had a series of defeats in elections in several states. Kishor's experience with the Congress, however, has not been satisfactory and in the past, he had criticised the party and its style of functioning. In the 2017 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, the Congress-Samajwadi Party alliance had failed. For Kishor, the only bright spot was Punjab, where the Congress had beaten the Akali-BJP coalition. In May, Kishor remarked that the Congress is a "100-year-old political party and they have their ways of functioning". "They are not open to working on the ways suggested by people like Prashant Kishor or others. They won't be open to working with my style of functioning," he had said, adding that the Congress "must realise that it has a problem and then do something about it".||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-251

01-09-2021||India||SC expresses ‘serious concern’ over rights violations of women inmates in mental health institutes||The Supreme Court on Wednesday expressed serious concern over the alleged violations of human rights of women in mental health institutions like tonsuring of their head and lack of privacy and asked the Centre to immediately take up the issue with the States and Union Territories (UTs) to alleviate these problems. The top court also directed all the States and UTs to ensure time bound Covid-19 vaccination of all inmates lodged in mental health institutions along with health care workers and others. A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli noted that based on certain research studies conducted in 2016 by NIMHANS and National Commission for Women in 2020, it has been highlighted that women who are institutionalised in government run mental health establishments across the country face several indignities and violation of human rights. The issues which have been flagged in the interlocutory application are of serious concern. We direct that the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment shall strictly raise each of the concerns which have been expressed in the research studies and has been formulated with the States/UTs in the course of monthly monitoring that has been directed, the bench said. The top court directed that necessary directions shall be issued for taking steps to ensure that the problems which have been highlighted in the study are alleviated by the state governments and UTs by taking necessary measures. The bench took note of submission of advocate Gaurav Bansal, who has filed an interlocutory application, saying that three research studies conducted by an NGO Human Rights Watch in 2014, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences in 2016 and National Commission for Women in 2020 have highlighted that women institutionalized in government run mental health establishments are facing several problems. He said that they are facing problems like lack of Sanitary Napkins, lack of Privacy, tonsuring of head, lack of issuance of Identity Cards (like UIDAI / Aadhar Card ), lack of issuance of disability certificates and lack of issuance of disability pension. Bansal pointed out that women institutionalized in Mental Health Establishments (for treatment or rehabilitation purpose) are not allowed to keep their Children with them as there is no separate mother child ward in many of the government run mental health establishments. The top court also noted that the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has requested to all the States and UTs in pursuance of the orders of the court to ensure vaccination of mentally ill persons, who are lodged in mental health establishments against COVID-19 on a priority basis. In order to ensure, that these directions are complied with by all the States/UTs, we direct to lay down a time bound schedule for facilitating vaccination of all persons who are lodged in mental health care institutions, no later than within a period of one month from the date of receipt of this order, the bench said. It said that a progress report shall be filed by every States/UTs with the department of social justice and empowerment of the union ministry on or before October 15, 2021 explaining the steps taken, the number of persons who are vaccinated against COVID-19 in the mental health care institutions. The bench said, The vaccination of inmates must also be coupled with vaccination of all the service providers as well as health care professionals, and other staffs associated with these institutions . It added that the progress shall be monitored by the Centre and details shall be submitted to this court, when a status report is next filed, in pursuance of the directions given in this order. On July 6, the top court had directed the Centre to ensure that people lodged in mental health establishments are tested for COVID-19 and fully vaccinated at the earliest. It had taken serious note of Maharashtra government's shifting patients lodged in mental health institutes to homes for beggars and asked it to discontinue the practice immediately saying it is counter-productive and runs against the provisions of Mental Health Act. It had noted Centre's assurance that vaccination of inmates would be taken up with utmost priority. Bansal in his plea has said that around 10,000 people who are fit to be discharged are forced to live in different mental hospitals across the country due to social stigma. On July 26, 2019, the top court had asked the Centre to explore the possibility for rehabilitation and reintegration of people who have recovered from mental illness and are fit to go home but are languishing in hospitals due to social stigma. It had asked the Centre to submit a plan with regard to compliance of its 2017 verdict by which the court has asked all the States and UTs to rehabilitate those who have recovered from mental illness but are staying in the hospitals. Earlier, the apex court had favoured framing of a uniform national policy to deal with those suffering from mental illness and their release from hospitals on being cured.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-251
01-09-2021||India||BJP ally JD(U) asks government to roll back hike in cooking gas cylinder price||The BJP ally Janata Dal (United) demanded on Wednesday that the government roll back the hike in cooking gas cylinder prices and step in to check the rising fuel prices as these have affected common households. JD(U) spokesperson K C Tyagi said the repeated hike in the LPG price has affected people's budget adversely. "The government should roll back the hike," he said. He also spoke against leaving petrol and diesel prices to market mechanism, and said the government must step in to curb their cost for people's benefit. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's party has of late taken positions on certain issues that have raised eyebrows. Kumar had backed the opposition's demand for a probe into the alleged snooping involving Pegasus spyware. He has also led the chorus for a caste census, a politically fraught issue over which the BJP has so far maintained silence. The prices of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cooking gas cylinders across all categories including subsidised gas were hiked on Wednesday by Rs 25 per cylinder -- the third straight increase in rates in less than two months. Subsidised as well as non-subsidised LPG now costs Rs 884.50 per 14.2-kg cylinder in Delhi, according to a price notification of oil companies.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-251
01-09-2021||India||Asthma, allergy symptoms prevalent in school kids in Delhi, 2 other cities: Study||A study examining the lung health status of over 3,000 school students in Delhi and two cities in southern India has found "high prevalence" of symptoms related to asthma and allergy, and childhood obesity, doctors claimed on Wednesday. The primary aim of the study was to assess the respiratory health of adolescent school children in the age brackets of 13-14 and 16-17 studying in private schools in Delhi, and compare it with relatively cleaner cities in terms of air pollution -- Kottayam in Kerala and Mysuru in Karnataka, they said. The Lung Care Foundation and the Pulmocare Research and Education (PURE) Foundation had joined hands for this exercise, which began in 2019, across 12 randomly selected schools in these three cities, noted lung surgeon Arvind Kumar said. Kumar, founder trustee of the Lung Care Foundation, said the study conducted on 3,157 school children got published in a leading peer-reviewed medical journal, Lung India, on August 31, 2021. The study has found that there is a "high prevalence of symptoms related to asthma and allergy, airway obstruction or asthma, and childhood obesity," the team which led the study said in a statement. A press conference was also held online to announce the findings of the study. All children completed a comprehensive questionnaire developed by the International Study for Asthma and Allergic Diseases in Children (ISAAC). Besides, they also underwent an on-site spirometry, which is the gold standard test to assess lung function, by certified technicians and nurses, Kumar said. One of the key findings from the questionnaire data was that "an alarmingly high number of children reported asthma and allergy-related symptoms". In Delhi, 52.8 per cent school children reported sneezing, 44.9 per cent reported itchy and watery eyes, 38.4 per cent reported significant cough, 33 per cent reported itchy rash, 31.5 per cent reported shortness of breath, 11.2 per cent reported chest tightness, and 8.75 per cent reported eczema, according to the study. In Kottayam and Mysuru, 39.3 per cent school children reported sneezing, 28.8 per cent itchy and watery eyes, 18.9 per cent significant cough, 12.1 per cent itchy rash, 10.8 per cent shortness of breath, 4.7 per cent chest tightness, and 1.8 per cent reported eczema, it said. Among the sample population, boys were observed to have a two-fold higher prevalence of asthma than girls. This observation was common at all the three sites, the study said. In Delhi, 37.2 per cent of boys vis-a-vis 19.9 per cent girls had prevalence of asthma, 31.4 per cent boys in Kottayam and 29.7 per cent in Mysuru, it added. Among the 29.3 per cent children observed to have asthma on spirometry in Delhi, only 12 per cent reported to have been diagnosed with asthma, and only three per cent used some form of inhalers. In contrast, among the 22.6 per cent children observed to have asthma on spirometry in the two southern cities, 27 per cent reported to have been diagnosed and eight per cent were using some form of inhalers, as per the study. Thus, a significant number of asthmatic children are not diagnosed to have asthma and a vast majority do not receive the right treatment. This figure is much higher in Delhi as compared to Kottayam and Mysuru, doctors said. Children from Delhi were more obese and overweight than children from the other two cities combined, (39.8 per cent vs 16.4 per cent), the study claimed. "Children who were obese and overweight had a 79 per cent greater chance of having asthma on spirometry across all three sites combined. However, overweight and obese children living in Delhi had 38 per cent higher chance of spirometrically defined airflow obstruction than overweight/obese children from Kottayam and Mysuru," it said. "The association between obesity, overweight in children and higher prevalence of asthma is being reported for the first time in any study from India," the study claimed.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-251
01-09-2021||India||Delhi schools full of chatter as students return to classroom after 17 long months||The corridors and staircases that had fallen silent after COVID-19 forced schools in the national capital to shut down in 2020 woke up to the familiar sound of footsteps and indistinct chatter over a year later as students returned to their classrooms on Wednesday. After looking at their teachers and classmates on computer screens for 17-long-months during their virtual sessions, uniform-clad students of classes 9-12 were visibly overjoyed on their first day back to school meeting their friends, running to classrooms, and attending classes. And while the familiarity of being back at school was reassuring, there was no denying that the experience of going to school amid COVID-19 was starkly different from the one during the pre-pandemic world. Social distancing, wearing masks, thermal screening, and no exchange of stationery and lunches on school premises felt alien to many students. Ayushka Gupta, a student at a government school in Tilak Nagar was thankful for the Wednesday morning rains that made wearing masks through the school day a lot more bearable. "Since the weather was pleasant, we could wear masks and study. That was a blessing. Had the weather been hot and humid, wearing masks and concentrating in class would have been a challenge," she said. While most schools have reopened on Wednesday, some institutions in Delhi, however, chose to adopt a wait-and-watch approach and have decided to call children for physical classroom studies only after a few weeks. Classrooms in several schools had the list of Covid-appropriate behaviour written out on the blackboards. At the Government Boys Secondary School in Sunder Nagri, the list of instructions also included encouraging fellow classmates to return to school, continuing online classes post school hours, and sharing their experience of coming back to school. At the Mount Abu Public School in Rohini that welcomed back students of classes 10,11 and 12 on Wednesday, children were allowed to enter the premises post a thermal screening. "Our staffers were there at the entrance with their umbrellas to oversee thermal scanning and sanitisation processes. We had prepared a special entrance gate for the open area between the main gate and reception to welcome students but it could not be placed since it was raining quite heavily in the morning. "The gate had been adorned with flowers and had the message written on it 'Welcome Back To School' and an inspirational quote but rain played spoilsport. We are looking to place it when we will be reopening for class 9 students," said school principal Jyoti Arora. While the new regulations and restrictions appear to be disconcerting of the idea of school life that has been traditionally characterised with a sense of freedom and uninhabitedness, given the circumstances, most students were just relieved to resume classes face-to-face. Like Richa Rani of Government Girls Senior Secondary School in Vasundhara Enclave. A class 12 student, Richa faced a lot of network issues during her online classes, and is happy to get back to school. "One of the major challenges we faced during online classes was network issues. Due to bad signals, our time and energy went into getting connected with regular classes. But now that we are in school, we have a set routine. We have a proper mindset and can stay focused," she said. Richa's batchmate Ravina Kumari agreed that online and offline education experience was quite different, particularly for specific subjects. "I found it difficult to follow economics during online classes. Concepts are tricky and require analysis. But now that I'm back in school and have my teachers by my side to clear my doubts on the spot, I'm hopeful I can improve and perform well in the subject," she said, adding her school opened at 7:30 am and closed by noon. For others, online classes after a point of time just felt "boring". "Attending offline classes becomes boring after a point of time and we tend to lose interest. "Now I'm back in class. It's exciting and I enjoyed learning with my classmates. In class, we have our teacher around us explaining the concepts in depth and clearing our doubts," she said. For teachers too, reopening of school and physical classes felt like a reassuring return to normalcy. "We were completely ready to reopen our school. We have completely sanitised our school. All our staff have been vaccinated and students are also extremely happy to be back in school. "Now all their queries and doubts can be addressed promptly by teachers. Students were also missing schools. Third wave is a concern but we are hopeful if all precautions are being taken, we will be able to function smoothly," said Usha Rajput, Head of School, Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Vasundhara Enclave. The Delhi government last week had allowed schools to reopen from September 1, citing a marked improvement in the Covid situation in the national capital.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-251
01-09-2021||India||Unsatisfied over UP Police probe on missing girl case, SC asks Delhi Police to join investigation||The Supreme Court Wednesday pulled up the Uttar Pradesh Police for its probe into a case of a 13-year-old missing girl and directed it to forthwith share the investigation report with Delhi Police so that the minor could be traced. The apex court also warned the Uttar Pradesh Police that the case may be handed over to the CBI if it failed to trace the minor, who has been missing since July 8. The top court, which termed the case as "a very sensitive matter," also said that the time factor is equally important" and every minute is precious. It was hearing a plea filed by the mother of the girl seeking directions to the Uttar Pradesh Police and the Delhi Police to trace her minor daughter. The mother, who works as a domestic help in Delhi, has claimed in her petition that her daughter is believed to have been kidnapped from Gorakhpur by a man when her family members had gone there to attend a marriage ceremony. An FIR was registered in the case at Gorakhpur. "You (Uttar Pradesh Police) share the entire information with Delhi Police. We will ask them to do the needful. You share your investigation report with Delhi Police by tomorrow. We are directing you," a bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar told the counsel appearing for state of Uttar Pradesh. The counsel representing Uttar Pradesh told the bench, also comprising justices Hrishikesh Roy and C T Ravikumar, that police is trying to trace the girl and they also have the call detail records. The counsel said the police be given two more weeks as the case involves investigation in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi and they have also received information that the girl might be in Bengal. "The time factor is equally important. We may transfer it to the CBI if you are unable to do it. The incident is of July. We have entered in September. If you have the details, why you will take time," the bench asked. The top court said the police will have to investigate the matter and find out the details. "In this case, every hour, every minute is precious. You are not showing the anxiety that is expected in a matter like this. It is a very sensitive matter," the bench observed. "Where is the question of two weeks, it said, adding, You have the call details and yet you have not moved into action. We are surprised." The top court directed the Uttar Pradesh Police to share the entire investigation report with the Delhi Police by Thursday. The bench, while posting the matter for hearing on Friday, asked the Delhi Police Commissioner to ensure that prompt further investigation is undertaken for tracing out the girl. The top court had on August 27 issued notice on the petition and posted it for hearing today. In her petition filed through advocate Pai Amit, the girl's mother has sought directions for carrying out investigation into the disappearance and kidnapping of her daughter and take appropriate action against those who may be found involved in this. The habeas corpus petition, which has sought to produce the girl before the court, has alleged that despite an FIR being lodged at Gorakhpur and an attempt being made to make a complaint with the Delhi Police, no action has been taken to trace the minor. It said the man, who is suspected to have kidnapped the girl, was constantly luring and coaxing her to accompany him. She claimed after an FIR was registered in Gorakhpur, she returned to Delhi and approached a police station where she had complained regarding the man on a previous occasion but the police refused to register or take steps towards recording her complaint with respect to kidnapping of her daughter on the grounds that a prior FIR has already been lodged in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-251
01-09-2021||India||Jallianwala Bagh complex restored with utmost respect, says Culture Ministry||Amid allegations the government was "glamourising" the Jallianwala Bagh complex, the Culture Ministry Wednesday said it has been "restored" by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the agency that has restored World Heritage sites in the country, to conserve it for posterity. It also said a "poignant" soundtrack has been chosen as part of the sound and light show describing the event on the day of the massacre. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently inaugurated four new galleries and opened the renovated memorial virtually, a year-and-a-half after it was closed for the revamp. The well into which the people jumped when forces led by Reginald Dyer opened fire on them has been covered with a transparent barrier. The narrow entrance has been adorned with sculptures. A daily sound and light show explaining the events has been started. Ministry of Culture Secretary Raghvendra Singh argued the complex was in dire need of conservation. "It has been restored by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) which is the agency that restored World Heritage sites in the country. Instead of letting a derelict structure to fall, we have restored it to conserve it for posterity," he told PTI, but refused to comment on the political storm brewing over the restoration. On the criticism over the light and sound show, Singh said that the show existed but it became defunct over time. "The soundtrack is so poignant. It has been very sensitively done and is informative as well. Anyone coming to this place will leave better informed. The galleries too have been improved, technology has been improved to bring out the poignancy of the killings of innocents and how the incident influenced other bravehearts," said Singh. He said the work has been done with "utmost respect". Slamming the revamp, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said only a person who does not know the "meaning of martyrdom can inflict such an insult on the martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh". "I am the son of a martyr I will not tolerate the insult of martyrs at any cost We are against this indecent cruelty," he had earlier this week. Some historians have also criticised the work terming it an "insult towards the martyrs". "This is corporatisation of monuments, where they end up as modern structures, losing the heritage value. Look after them without meddling with the flavours of the period these memorials represent," tweeted historian S Irfan Habib. Officials, however, say that these allegations are "untrue". They said the accusation that the bullet marks have even "hidden" was false. The bullet marks have been conserved, they said. They said the earlier structure was "filthy" with defunct fountains which have now been restored, cleaned and a lily pond installed. The entire area has been landscaped, officials said, making the place visually appealing. Officials involved in the process said the well was covered with rubbish, now it has been restored and even lit from inside. In terms of tourist footfall too, the restoration will bring rich dividends for the city, officials said. Near to the Golden Temple, the renovated complex is expected to draw in tourists with its moesha halls, laser show and galleries, the ministry hopes. The Golden Temple received a footfall of around one lakh per day during the week and 1.5 lakh during weekends and special day before the coronavirus crisis forced its closure. Over 1,000 people were killed and hundreds wounded on April 13, 1919 when British troops fired indiscriminately on an unarmed gathering of thousands who had assembled in Jallianwala Bagh in Punjab amid nationwide protests against the Rowlatt Act which had extended wartime repressive measures.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-251
01-09-2021||India||NIA, Maha govt oppose bail pleas of Elgaar Parishad accused||The Maharashtra government as well as the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday opposed applications for `default' bail filed by some of the accused in the Elgaar Parishad-Maoists links case before the Bombay High Court. After both sides concluded arguments, the court reserved its order. Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Shoma Sen, Mahesh Raut, Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira have challenged the power of the Pune sessions court which took cognizance of the charge sheet in 2019, and sought bail on this technical ground or `by default'. On Wednesday, senior advocate Sudeep Pasbola, Dhawale's lawyer, told a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar that the accused were booked for `scheduled offenses' under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), and hence only a special court for UAPA cases could have handled the case and not an ordinary sessions court. On the other hand, Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, the state government's lawyer, argued that in September 2018 the Pune court had granted extension of 90 days to Pune Police (who probed the case initially) to file a charge sheet. As the charge sheet was filed within that period, the accused were not entitled to default bail, he said. Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, who appeared for the NIA, made the same argument. A court taking cognizance of charge sheet has no relevance for default bail application, he added. Advocate Pasbola said the NIA's argument was that the case should have gone before a special court only after the central agency took it over in January 2020, but that was not what the law mandated. The bench then reserved the matter for order. Activist and lawyer Sudha Bharadwaj, a co-accused, too had filed a similar plea earlier this year seeking default bail. Bharadwaj's counsel and senior advocate Yug Chaudhry had argued before the HC that judge K D Vadane, who had taken cognizance of the police's charge sheet and remanded Bharadwaj and seven other accused in judicial custody, was not a designated special judge. The bench led by Justice Shinde reserved its order on Bharadwaj's plea on August 4. It is yet to be pronounced. The case relates to Elgaar Parishad, a conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017. Pune Police had alleged that it had been backed by Maoists, and provocative speeches made there led to caste violence near Bhima-Koregaon war memorial the next day.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-251
01-09-2021||India||Jaishankar speaks to British counterpart Dominic Raab on Afghanistan situation||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar spoke to his British counterpart Dominic Raab on Wednesday on the situation in Afghanistan, their second such conversation in a week. India has been in constant touch with all major countries on the fast-paced developments in Afghanistan, particularly after the Taliban took control of the country on August 15. "Nice speaking again to UK Foreign Secretary @DominicRaab. Conversation focused on Afghanistan related developments," Jaishankar tweeted. The Jaishankar-Raab conversation came a day after the US completed the withdrawal of its forces from Afghanistan, ending its two-decade war in the country. The external affairs minister spoke to Raab on August 25 as well on the Afghan crisis. On Wednesday, Jaishankar also spoke to Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Al Busaidi. "Good to talk to Omani Foreign Minister @badralbusaidi. Discussed Afghanistan and Covid. Thank Oman for supporting our repatriation flights," Jaishankar tweeted. India has been closely monitoring the unfolding developments in Afghanistan. Indian Ambassador to Qatar Deepak Mittal met senior Taliban leader Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai in Doha on Tuesday, in the first formal and pubicly acknowledged contact between the two sides. The meeting took place at the Indian embassy in Doha at the request of the Taliban side and came two weeks after the outfit seized control of Kabul. India has been a key stakeholder in Afghanistan and it has invested nearly USD 3 billion in carrying out nearly 500 projects across Afghanistan. The UN Security Council, under India's presidency, on Monday adopted a resolution demanding that the territory of Afghanistan not be used to threaten any country or shelter terrorists. There have been mounting concerns in India over the possibility of rise in activities of various terror groups, including Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, from Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-251

He also alleged that while sections such as farmers, salaried class and labourers were being demonetised, a few industrialist friends of Prime Minister Narendra Modi were being monetised. At a press conference, Gandhi said the government has come up with a new concept of GDP, wherein a rise in GDP means a rise in prices of Gas, Diesel and Petrol. The former Congress chief alleged that the government has earned Rs 23 lakh crore from increasing prices of gas, diesel and petrol in the last seven years, and said the people of the country should ask where is this money going. "On one hand there is demonetisation and on the other there is monetisation. Whose demonetisation is taking place -- farmers, labourers, small traders and informal sector, MSMEs, contract workers, salaried class and honest industrialists. Whose monetisation is taking place -- four-five friends of Prime Minister Narendra Modi," Gandhi said. The Congress leader alleged that a transfer of wealth is taking place from the poor and the weak to the prime minister's friends. He said that the government was panicking over not being able to fulfil its promises and was surviving on fuel prices. Gandhi added that the day when the international crude oil prices rise to about USD 90-100, the situation will spiral out of control here. He also compared figures of cooking gas cylinders, petrol and diesel between the time when UPA was in power in early 2014 to now. The LPG gas price was Rs 410 per cylinder in 2014 when the UPA (Congress-led United Progressive Alliance) was in power, now it is Rs 885. Petrol was at Rs 71.5 per litre in 2014 when the UPA was in power, now it is Rs 101 and diesel has risen from Rs 57 to Rs 88, Gandhi said. International prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas are down since 2014, but prices are still rising in India, he said. The Congress party has been attacking the government over the rise in petrol, diesel and LPG prices and has been demanding a reduction in them by removing some of the taxes imposed by the central government. The prices of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cooking gas cylinders across all categories including subsidised gas on Wednesday were hiked by Rs 25 per cylinder -- the third straight increase in rates in less than two months. Subsidised as well as non-subsidised LPG now costs Rs 884.50 per 14.2-kg cylinder in Delhi, according to a price notification of oil companies.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-252

They said a large number of people are coming out of their villages to enroll themselves for different welfare measures. "As part of an initiative, the district administration is providing all basic facilities to the villagers at one place through convenience camps in remote villages," a statement issued here by the Chhattisgarh information Centre said. Through this facility, villagers have been facilitated to take benefits of Aadhaar card, ration card, Ayushman card, pension registration etc., it said Vinit Nandanwar, the collector of worst naxal-affected Sukma district, said these camps are receiving a very good response from the local. "A camp being organised at silger village has helped 717 villagers to enroll themselves for Aadhaar cards, 287 for ration cards, 100 for Ayushman card and 31 for pension (old age, disability) facility as of now," he told PTI. He said the villagers have been approaching the local administration seeking more such camps. "They are happy to come out and get themselves enrolled for different welfare schemes at these camps," said Nandanwar, a 2013-batch IAS officer. He said the camps are instilling confidence among the villagers to come out of the villages and to take benefits of government measures. He said the administration has made arrangements of vehicles and food to facilitate the locals coming to the camp. In the past, a camp was also organised in Kankerlanka village to make Aadhaar, Ayushman and ration cards of the villagers. In the coming days, camps will also be organised in other villages, so that more and more rural people of the district can easily get Aadhaar card, Ayushman card, ration card etc. and can take the benefit of various government schemes, Nandanwar said. Ritesh Kumar Agrawal, the collector of neighbouring Bijapur, another naxal-hit district, said these integrated development camps are facilitating much-needed welfare measures for these villagers. "The government has been trying to ensure that the villagers do get benefits of welfare measures meant for them. These integrated development camps help them in taking such benefits," he told PTI. Agrawal said, through these camps, the administration was able to make 11,484 new Aadhaar cards while 11,000 Aadhaar cards were updated. "There has been tremendous response from the villagers towards these camps. We plan to make it a permanent feature by converting these camps to a fixed kiosk or settlement where people can go and get themselves enrolled for different welfare measures," he said. Agrawal, a 2012-batch IAS officer, said such camps will ensure that other development avenues like roads, schools and more ration shops reach these areas, usually cut-off from such basic facilities due to different reasons.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-252

Issuing the notices, the National Human Rights Commission has observed that it is "shocking" the woman felt "victimised by the system". "The National Human Rights Commission has taken cognisance of a complaint that a woman, victim of alleged sexual assault and police apathy set herself on fire along with a man outside the Supreme Court in New Delhi on August 16, 2021. Subsequently both died while undergoing treatment at RML Hospital," the NHRC said in a statement. The commission has issued notices to the Director General of Police, Uttar Pradesh and the Commissioner of Police, Delhi, asking them to submit a detailed report in four weeks, along with the action initiated against the errant public servants, it said. The Uttar Pradesh DGP has also been directed to "ensure safety and security of the family members of the victims", the statement said. Allegedly, before immolating themselves, they recorded a live video on Facebook, wherein the woman had said that in June 2019 she had lodged a rape case against an MP from Uttar Pradesh, but the "accused police officials were supporting the offender", the rights panel said in the statement. "Allegedly, instead of taking action against the accused MP, the police registered a false case against her and get issued a non-bailable warrant against her," it said. After the woman and the man had attempted self-immolation, the police had registered a case under Section 309 (attempt to commit suicide) of the Indian Penal Code. They suspected the man had convinced the woman to take the extreme step. They had said she was from Uttar Pradesh's Ghazipur and was allegedly raped by Bahujan Samaj Party MP Atul Rai in 2019. The MP has been in judicial custody in the case for the last two years. Earlier, a senior police officer had said that the man and the woman took the extreme step as a court had issued a non-bailable warrant against them in a case of forgery for allegedly submitting wrong proof of age in the rape case. In her Facebook video, the woman had mentioned the warrant and that she had been summoned by the judge.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-252
01-09-2021||India||Pradhan reviews status of reopening of schools in country||Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan held a meeting with senior ministry officials on Wednesday on the status of the reopening of schools across the country and the roadmap for vaccinating their staff. Schools were closed in March last year ahead of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of novel coronavirus infection. The Centre had allowed the reopening of schools as per the Covid-19 situation in respective states in October last year. While several states began partial reopening of schools, there was a complete closure again in April this year when an aggressive second wave of COVID-19 hit the country. With the improvement in the COVID-19 situation, several states have begun reopening schools now even as concerns have been expressed over the staff and teachers not being completely vaccinated. "Shiksha Mantri Shri @dpradhanbjp reviewed the status of schools reopening across the country with senior officials of Deptt. of School Education & Literacy. He also  in schools by the month of September," the Ministry of Education said in a tweet. The ministry added that the Centre is prioritising vaccination of teaching and non-teaching staff in schools across the country to "ensure a safe environment for reopening of schools".||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-252

The INSACOG said Delta continues to be the dominant lineage in India and globally. When a person gets an infection even after being vaccinated against it, it is called a breakthrough case. The number of reported vaccination breakthroughs in India are well within the numbers expected from the total number of infections, the fraction of population that is vaccinated and the known reduction in the effectiveness of Covishield/Covaxin against infections by Delta. Vaccines continue to protect against severe disease and remain a cornerstone of public health strategy, the bulletin dated August 30 said. It said based on high stringency reclassification by INSACOG, the total number of Delta sub-lineages - Delta Plus AY.1 to AY.12 - in India are only 856 out of all samples analysed, which is much less than what is reported on some global websites. It said AY.12 that was first noted in Israel and currently driving infection in the country, which has inoculated 60 percent of its population, is not yet seen in India. Similar sequences that are also being classified as AY.12 at low stringency do not have the same epidemiological significance, the INSACOG said. However, there was no word on the new variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, that has been detected in South Africa and many other countries globally which could be more transmissible and evade protection provided by vaccines. Scientists from National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP) in South Africa said the potential variant of interest, C.1.2, was first detected in the country in May this year. C.1.2 has since been found in China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mauritius, England, New Zealand, Portugal and Switzerland as of August 13, they said. The INSACOG said there are no new VOC (Variant of Concern) or VUIs (Variant Under Investigation) added globally. Updated biological data suggest that Delta plus K417N (AY.1, AY.2) is antigenically similar to Delta with cross-neutralisation. There is thus no significantly increased risk of immune escape by Delta+K417N in people with immunity to Delta, as per the updated biological data. Vaccination breakthroughs with Delta continue to be highly frequent and the same is likely to be true for Delta sub-lineages, it said with regards to infections globally. The INSACOG said AY.4 variant is a major evolutionary branch of Delta, as would be expected with time and spread, and presently has no other known clinical significance. Since the new lineage-defining mutations are not presently of clinical significance, these should not be considered Delta plus which is, in any case, an inexact terminology best restricted to AY.1 and AY.2 variants at this time, it said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-252

Hearing a writ petition filed by Madrasa Anjuman Islamia Faizul Uloom and another, Justice Ajay Bhanot asked the state government to file a counter affidavit within a period of four weeks and fixed October 6 as the next date of hearing. The bench asked the state government to bring in the record the syllabi/courses, conditions and standards of recognition including the requirement for playgrounds at the madrasas and all other religious institutions which are recognised or aided by the state government. The court also asked whether madrasas so recognised and aided also admit girl students.The state government shall also indicate in its affidavit the details of various other boards of education with institutions imparting theological education of other religious sects. The court directed the state to reply that whether the policy of the state government to provide financial aid to institutions imparting religious education is consistent with the scheme of the Constitution particularly in light of the word secular in the Preamble to the Constitution. The court asked whether other religious minorities are also provided government aid for running theological schools and whether there is a prohibition against women from applying as students in religious schools and if so whether such bar is an act of discrimination prohibited by the Constitution. In its plea, the madrasa recognized by the Madrasa Board, sought the creation of additional posts of teachers in view of the increasing number of students. The court passed these directives on August 19.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-252
01-09-2021||India||Afghan protestors outside UNHCR could act as super spreader of Covid, says Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court Wednesday expressed concern over a large gathering of Afghan nationals protesting outside UNHCR office and seeking refugee status, saying it could act as a super spreader of coronavirus as there is lack of adherence to COVID-19 appropriate norms. The high court said the situation cannot be permitted to continue as the protestors could be seen sitting and standing next to each other without even wearing masks and asked the authorities to act on it. Justice Rekha Palli asked the Centre, Delhi government and police to coordinate on how the issue can be resolved and to see the gathering does not act as a super spreader of COVID-19. The high court issued notices to the ministries of Home Affairs and External Affairs, Delhi government, Delhi Police, South Delhi Municipal Corporation and Delhi Jal Board on a petition by Vasant Vihar Welfare Association which stated that the foreign nationals (refugees/ asylum seekers) have gathered outside the office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR) at B Block in South Delhi's Vasant Vihar since August 15, including lanes and parks adjoining it and residents are facing difficulties due to this. The point is that the general public is suffering because of this, the court said and asked the Delhi government to inform what it has done in pursuance to the Supreme Court's direction to frame guidelines on the issue of the right to protest so as to ensure a balance between fundamental rights and the maintenance of law and order. The petition said the number of such foreign nationals from Afghanistan has increased manifold in the past week owing to the takeover of Afghanistan by Taliban forces, forcing many to seek asylum in different countries including India. Advocate Hrishikesh Baruah, appearing for the association, said the residents are facing difficulties in commuting and going to markets for purchasing essential goods and the manner in which the foreign nationals are protesting sitting next to each other is likely to be a super spreader of COVID-19 and sought to remove the protestors from there and clear the passage. He said people are staying there, littering, defacating in open and encroaching upon the area and they are probably not even vaccinated for COVID-19. The petition, filed through advocates Shahrukh Ejaz and Nilotpal Bansal, also sought direction to the Ministry of External Affairs to frame appropriate policy for ensuring that such nuisance to the local residents does not occur on the account of foreign missions/ diplomacies being in the vicinity of residential localities. Central government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul submitted that it was not a normal situation and the residents should have some humanitarian approach and these are international issues that cannot be decided overnight as they have huge international consequences. Delhi government additional standing counsel Satyakam said there are around 500 protestors at the side and sufficient force has been deployed therein day and night and Centre shall be asked to resolve the issue of foreign nationals at the earliest. The high court asked the authorities to take instructions on how the issue can be resolved and listed the matter for further hearing on September 3. "We are also dealing with COVID-19. Look at the pictures. What if this could be super spreader of COVID-19. What is this, there are no masks. You should ensure some protocol is there. Why are they not wearing a mask? You are challenging people daily for not wearing masks in cars," the court said. "It is not the inconvenience only with which I am concerned. I am more concerned that it should not act as a super spreader of COVID-19 again. The city has barely coped with the second wave. You have to ensure that the protestors follow COVID protocol. Let them wear mask and then protest," the judge further said, The petition said the area has turned into a protest site where people from all age groups including children are congregating and added that putting children in a situation especially where the third wave of COVID-19 is imminent and is predicted to affect children more severely is extremely disastrous. In absence of any arrangement by the authorities to settle these foreign nationals, they are dwelling on the lanes and park of the petitioner's vicinity while congregating in large numbers, thus, posing a high health risk to the residents, it said. It further said the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has also pushed the Afghan refugees already living in India to desperation as they are left without any financial backing from their families and friends there.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-252

The man who was killed owned a restaurant inside a residential complex called Mitra. Late on Tuesday, the Swiggy agent reached the restaurant to collect an order of chicken biryani and poori sabzi. While the biryani was ready on time, the delivery agent was told by a worker that the other order would take a little more time. An argument broke out between the two, following which the delivery agent allegedly verbally abused the restaurant employee. This is when the owner of the restaurant, Sunil Agarwal, tried to intervene and end the argument. The delivery agent allegedly shot him in the head with the help of his friend, according to NDTV.com. The restaurant employee and other staff members rushed him to hospital where he was declared dead. "I was called (by the restaurant staff) to say their owner was shot. When I reached, he was still breathing. I first dialled 100 and then for an ambulance. But later, we took him to hospital in our vehicle," said Rakesh Nagar, who lives near the restaurant. "The delivery boy killed the restaurant owner because there was delay in getting the order ready," police officer Vishal Pandey said, adding that three teams have been formed to catch the culprit.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-252
01-09-2021||India||Under attack, Rawat apologises for his 'Panj Pyare' remark||AICC general secretary Harish Rawat, who courted controversy by referring to the party's Punjab leadership as 'Panj Pyare', on Wednesday apologised for hurting the sentiments of the people. Rawat, who had arrived in Chandigarh on Tuesday amid the ongoing rift in the party's state unit, had used the word 'Panj Pyare' for the Punjab Congress chief and four working presidents after a meeting at the Punjab Congress Bhawan. In Sikh tradition, 'Panj Pyare' is the term used for five beloved of the Guru. In 1699, Guru Gobind Singh, the last of the ten Gurus, initiated five men into the order of 'Khalsa' (pure). 'Panj Pyare' is the name given to five baptised Sikhs who perform a baptism ceremony to initiate Sikhs into the order of the 'Khalsa'. On his Facebook page on Wednesday, Rawat acknowledged his mistake for his 'Panj Pyare' remark. "Sometimes by expressing respect, you use such words which are objectionable. I too have made a mistake of using the word 'Panj Pyare' for my honourable president and four working presidents," wrote Rawat. He said he was a student of the country's history and the leading position of 'Panj Pyare' could not be compared with any other. "I have committed a mistake. I apologise for hurting the sentiments of people," he said. Rawat, who is party's Punjab affairs in-charge, said he will clean a gurdwara in his state with a broom as atonement. He said that he always had a sense of dedication and respect to Sikh religion and its great traditions. The Shiromani Akali Dal had taken exception to Rawat's remarks and had sought an apology for the same. SAD leader Daljit Singh Cheema had slammed Rawat for his remark and had demanded that the state government should book him for hurting sentiments.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-252

A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice on a plea by one Sadre Alam and listed the matter for further hearing on September 8. Appearing for NGO, 'Centre for Public Interest Litigation' (CPIL), which has challenged the appointment before the Supreme Court, lawyer Prashant Bhushan stated that Alam's petition was malafide and a complete copy paste of the plea pending before the apex court. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, opposed the PIL and sought time to respond to it on merit. The petition before the high court seemed to have been copied from the one before the Supreme Court, he added. In his petition before the high court, Alam has sought quashing of the July 27 order issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs appointing Asthana as the Delhi Police Commissioner and also the order granting inter-cadre deputation and extension of service to him. The plea, filed through advocate B S Bagga, also sought initiation of steps for appointing Delhi Police Commissioner strictly in accordance with the direction issued by the Supreme Court earlier. The impugned orders (of MHA) are in clear and blatant breach of the directions passed by the Supreme Court of India in Prakash Singh case as respondent no.2 (Asthana) did not have a minimum residual tenure of six months; no UPSC panel was formed for appointment of Delhi Police Commissioner; and the criteria of having a minimum tenure of two years has been ignored, the plea said. It claimed the High-Powered Committee comprising the Chief Justice of India, Prime Minister and the Leader of Opposition, in its meeting held on May 24, 2021, rejected the Central government's attempt to appoint Asthana as the CBI Director on the basis of the six-month rule as laid down by the Supreme Court in the Prakash Singh case. The appointment of Asthana to the post of Commissioner of Police, Delhi must be set aside on the same principle, it said. The petition with similar prayers which has been filed by CPIL before the Supreme Court has urged to direct the central government to produce the July 27 order it issued, approving the inter-cadre deputation of Asthana from Gujarat cadre to AGMUT cadre. The petition has also urged the apex court to set aside the Centre's order to extend Asthana's service period. On August 25, the Supreme Court had asked the high court to decide within two weeks the plea pending before it against the appointment of the senior IPS officer as Delhi Police Commissioner.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-253

India is the most polluted country in the world, with more than 480 million people or about 40 per cent of its population living in the Indo-Gangetic plains in the north where pollution levels regularly exceed those found anywhere else in the world by an order of magnitude, stated the University of Chicago's Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) report. The study by the varsity's Energy Policy Institute ascertains how much longer a person can live if they breathe clean air. Residents of northern India are on track to lose more than nine years of life expectancy if pollution levels of that of 2019 persist as the region experiences the most extreme levels of air pollution in the world, it said. In 2019, India's average particulate matter concentration was 70.3 microgram per cubic meter ( g/m3 ), the highest in the world and seven times the World Health Organisation's guideline of 10 g/m3, the report said. It said that alarmingly India's high levels of air pollution have expanded geographically over time. "Compared to a couple of decades ago, particulate pollution is no longer a feature of the Indo-Gangetic plains alone. Pollution has increased so much in the states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. For example, the average person in those states is now losing an additional 2.5 to 2.9 years of life expectancy, relative to early 2000," the report said. For Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan, the AQLI data reveals that the average person would live 5.6 years longer if pollution were reduced to meet the WHO guidelines, it said. "Due to South Asia's high population and pollution concentrations, the region accounts for 58 per cent of total life years lost due to particulate pollution exceeding the WHO guideline," it said. The benefits of clean air policy are even greater in the Indo-Gangetic plains, where 480 million people regularly breathe pollution levels that exceed those found in Europe and North America by an order of magnitude, the report said. Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan account for nearly a quarter of the global population and consistently rank among the top five most polluted countries in the world, it said. As a result, South Asia accounts for 60 per cent of the person-years that are expected to be lost globally due to pollution levels exceeding the WHO guideline, the University of Chicago's report said. "Average life expectancy across these four countries would be 5.6 years higher if pollution concentrations complied with the WHO guideline," it said. In India and Pakistan, the number of vehicles on the road has increased about four-fold since the early 2000s while in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan combined, electricity generation from fossil fuels tripled from 1998 to 2017, the report said. Crop burning, brick kilns, and other industrial activities have also contributed to rising particulates in the region, it said. The AQLI, the report said, particulate pollution is the world's greatest threat to human health. "South Asia is consistently the most polluted region, with the people there seeing their lives shortened by an average of 5 years relative to what it would be if the region met the WHO guideline and even more in the most polluted parts of the region like northern India," the report said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-253

Some institutions, however, chose to adopt a wait-and-watch approach and have decided to call children for physical classroom studies only after a few weeks. Following a marked improvement in the Covid situation in the national capital, the Delhi government on Friday had announced that schools for classes 9 to 12, colleges and coaching institutions would reopen from September 1. It had clarified that no student would be forced to attend physical classes and the consent of parents would be mandatory. "I am excited on meeting my friends," a Delhi government school student from east Delhi said, adding that with COVID-19 still around, everybody has to take precautions. "This is the new normal and we will have to adjust," the student said. Though it has allowed institutions to open, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has notified several safety guidelines. Allowing only 50 per cent students per classroom, mandatory thermal screening, staggered lunch breaks, alternate seating arrangement and avoiding routine guest visits are among the guidelines announced by the DDMA for reopening of schools. The DDMA has said students, teachers and non-teaching staff living in Covid containment zones will not be allowed to come to schools and colleges. "Physical classes are better than online classes. There is of course a fear of the virus but I hope that we can follow the appropriate norms and keep the virus at bay," a government school student from Dwarka said. Mount Carmel School in Dwarka does not plan to reopen for at least a month as its entire staff is not completely vaccinated, and has decided to continue with online learning. "We are not prepared to open our school right now. They haven't started vaccinating children and all my staff is not vaccinated. We are still in the middle of a pandemic. We are not going to take a chance," Dean, Mount Carmel School, Michael Williams, said. "It is being said that Zydus-Cadila has launched its vaccine for 12 to 18 year olds. I think it is much smarter to wait for another two months. We have waited for long and we can wait some more," he added. Modern Public School, Shalimar Bagh, reopened on Wednesday, but it is not providing buses for students as a precaution against COVID-19. While the government has noted that vaccination centres and activities like ration distribution which were going on in different schools will continue, the DDMA said the area being used for these activities should be separated from the area which will be used for academic activities.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-253
01-09-2021||India||Rains lash Delhi, traffic movement disrupted||A fresh spell of heavy rain pounded the capital on Wednesday morning, submerging low-lying areas in knee-deep water and affecting traffic movement in parts of the city. Officials at the India Meteorological Department (IMD said the Safdarjung Observatory, considered the official marker for the city, gauged 112.1 mm rainfall in the 24 hours ending 8:30 am on Wednesday, the highest in at least 12 years. In 2010, the capital had recorded 110 mm rainfall on September 20. The weather stations at Lodhi Road, Ridge, Palam and Ayanagar recorded 120.2 mm, 81.6 mm, 71.1 mm and 68.2 mm rainfall, respectively, in the 24 hours ending 8:30 am. On Tuesday, Delhi gauged 84 mm rainfall in just six hours -- between 8:30 am and 2:30 pm -- that flooded roads and led to massive traffic snarls on key stretches such as ITO, Ring Road near IP Estate flyover, Dhaula Kuan, and Rohtak road. At 6 am on Wednesday, the IMD issued an alert for "one or two spells of moderate rain" and "heavy rain at isolated places" in Delhi-NCR. Between 5:30 am and 8:30 am, the Safdarjung Observatory received 28 mm rainfall, officials said. The weather department said the rain could "flood low-lying areas and streets and disrupt the traffic flow on major roads". The Delhi Traffic Police issued an advisory against traffic obstruction at the Azad Market Subway going towards Pratap Nagar due to the heavy waterlogging at the road. It said the Zakhira underpass was also closed due to waterlogging. The IMD said more rainfall is likely during the day.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-253
01-09-2021||India||India and Taliban hold first official meet at Doha embassy||India on Tuesday officially had its first contact with the Taliban after the Afghanistan takeover when a senior leader of the group met the Indian ambassador to Qatar at the embassy in Doha. “Today, ambassador of India to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, met Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, the head of the Taliban’s political office in Doha. The meeting took place at the embassy of India, Doha, on the request of the Taliban side,” the Indian external affairs ministry said in a media release. Although India had purportedly opened channels of communication with the Taliban in the run-up to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, this is the first time New Delhi is acknowledging contact with the militant outfit that now rules the trouble-torn country. Before this, India had acknowledged any communication with the Taliban only once — during the Kandahar hijack crisis in 1999. Now, the official contact in Doha has taken place even before the Taliban regime has been recognised as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. As for diplomatic recognition of the Taliban, India remained silent, waiting like most other countries for the situation to stabilise in Afghanistan and see how the group reconciles differences within. The Doha meeting came hours after the last US soldier left Afghanistan, making it the first day the Taliban is officially in charge of the country although no government is technically in place yet. India said the conversation between the envoy and the Taliban official focussed on the safety, security and early return of Indian nationals stranded in Afghanistan. The travel of Afghan nationals, especially the minorities there, who wish to visit India also came up, according to the release. Mittal iterated India’s concern that Afghanistan’s soil should not be used for anti-India activities and terrorism in any manner. The release said the Taliban representative assured the ambassador that these issues would be positively addressed. The Taliban has had a political office in Doha since 2013. Soon after a comprehensive peace agreement was signed between the US and the Taliban in Doha in February 2020, Mittal — who had been the joint secretary, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, in the external affairs ministry, was sent to the Qatari capital to head India’s mission there. That the first official contact with the Taliban took place in the Doha embassy with Mittal running point suggests this is work in progress. Stanekzai, too, has an old relationship with India, having passed out of the Indian Military Academy in Dehradun. Last week, he had extended an olive branch to India, claiming that the Taliban wanted to maintain political, economic and cultural ties with the country and keep the air corridor active, as also the overland trade via Pakistan. Stanekzai told CNN-News 18 on Monday that the Taliban wanted to have friendly relations with all its neighbours and even the US. On the apprehension in New Delhi that the Taliban may team up with Pakistan against India, he said the two countries shared a long border and should settle their scores there. “We will not allow any of these two countries to use Afghanistan.… We will not allow anyone to use Afghan soil against any country,” Stanekzai said, articulating the hope that Afghan Hindus and Sikhs who had left Afghanistan after the Taliban assumed control would return and India would remain invested in Afghanistan. The only other time India has acknowledged any form of contact with the Taliban was in December 1999 for the release of the hijacked Indian Airlines flight that had been taken to Kandahar. India never recognised the Taliban when it was in power in Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001. But the investments that successive governments in New Delhi have made in the strife-wracked country over the past two decades have made it necessary for India to rethink its policy of not dealing with the Taliban, particularly in the face of the growing footprint of both China and Pakistan in Afghanistan. UN resolution The United Nations Security Council on Monday adopted a resolution demanding that Afghan territory not be used to threaten or attack any country, shelter or train terrorists and plan or finance terrorist attacks. The UNSC iterated the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan, including those individuals and entities designated in Resolution 1267. Both the Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Jaish-e-Mohammad are UN-banned organisations under UNSC Resolution 1267. Russia and China abstained but were one with the other countries in underlining the importance of ensuring that Afghanistan does not become a safe haven for terrorists.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-253
01-09-2021||India||Supreme Court orders demolition of 850 flats in twin-towers in Noida||The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the demolition of 850 flats in two towers of 40 floors each in Noida for not maintaining the requisite distance between buildings and asked the realtor, Supertech, to pay Rs 2 crore as compensation to the local residents’ welfare association. “The purpose of stipulating a minimum distance is a matter of public interest in planned development. The residents who occupy constructed areas in a housing project are entitled to ventilation, light and air and adherence to fire safety norms,” said Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, who authored the judgment. Supertech had constructed 17 towers, out of which the two have been ordered to be demolished within three months at the developer’s cost. Instead of the minimum required distance of 35.6 metres from Tower 1, only 9 metres separated Tower 1 from Tower 16 and Tower 17. These two towers (T-16 and T-17), which encroached on the open area including the garden of Tower 1, will have to be demolished. The court ordered the prosecution of the promoters and the conniving officials of Noida (the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority) on the fringes of the capital. Noida falls in Uttar Pradesh but for all practical purposes, it is an extension of Delhi. Supertech will have to refund all existing purchasers of flats in T-16 and T-17 with interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum payable with effect from the date of the respective deposits until the date of refund, the court said. The stipulated minimum distance addresses several concerns such as “safeguarding the privacy of the occupants and their enjoyment of basic civic amenities, including access to well-ventilated areas where air and light are not blocked by the presence of close towering constructions”, the court added. “Access to these amenities is becoming a luxury instead of a necessity. The prescription of a minimum distance also has a bearing on fire safety. In the event of a fire, there is a danger that the flames would rapidly spread from one structure to the adjoining ones. Moreover, the presence of structures in close proximity poses serious hurdles to fire-fighting machinery which has to be deployed by the civic body. “If a developer is left with the unbridled discretion to define the content of the expression ‘building block’, this will defeat the purpose of prescribing minimum distances, leaving the health, safety and quality of life of flat buyers at the mercy of developers,” the court said. The bench issued the directives while dismissing an appeal filed by Supertech challenging a 2014 judgment of a division bench of Allahabad High Court that directed the demolition of the illegal structures. The high court had passed the order while allowing an appeal filed by the Emerald Court Owner Residents’ Welfare Association seeking action against the authorities and the builder for the violations. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court bench said: “The appellant (Supertech) has stooped to the point of producing a fabricated sanctioned plan.” The illegal construction of T-16 and T-17 has been achieved through acts of collusion between officials in Noida and the appellant and its management, the bench added. The apex court said the consent of the individual flat owners of the original 15 towers, individually or through the RWA, was a necessary requirement under the Uttar Pradesh Apartments Act before T-16 and T-17 could have been constructed since they necessarily reduced the undivided interest of the individual flat owners in the common area by adding new flats and increasing the number from 650 to 1,500 flats. “In order to ensure that the work of demolition is carried out in a safe manner…, Noida shall consult its own experts and experts from the Central Building Research Institute (CBRI), Roorkee,” the court said. The demolition shall be carried out under the overall supervision of the CBRI or another expert agency nominated by Noida if the central institute is unable to involve itself, the bench said. The cost of the demolition and all incidental expenses, including the fees for the experts, shall be borne by the appellant, the bench added.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-253
01-09-2021||India||Politicians criticise JNU 'jihadi terrorism' course ||CPI parliamentary party leader Binoy Viswam has criticised as “deeply prejudiced”, “historically inaccurate”, “politically motivated” and “malignant” a recently approved course at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) that links Islamist and communist terror and describes “jihadi terrorism” as the only form of “fundamentalist-religious inspired terrorism”. In a letter to Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Tuesday, Viswam demanded a review of the course. Jawhar Sircar, Trinamul Congress Rajya Sabha MP and retired bureaucrat, traced the roots of such courses to “competition within the pro-BJP groups on campus to show who is more aggressive”. On August 17, JNU’s academic council approved a course on counter-terrorism that describes “jihadi terrorism” as the only form of “fundamentalist-religious inspired terrorism”, and claims that the erstwhile “Soviet Union and China have been predominant state sponsors of terrorism”, a model that has been “well adapted by several radical Islamic states” after the Cold War. The optional course — Counter-Terrorism, Asymmetric Conflicts and Strategies for Cooperation among Major Powers — will be offered to Master of Science dual-degree students specialising in international relations at JNU’s School of Engineering. Viswam said in his letter: “It is deeply unfortunate that higher education is being used as a platform to communalise and politicise geo-political issues through the presentation of half-truths and academically dishonest information. “Distorting history in an attempt to serve the vested political and communal interests of a certain ideology, the contents of the course make incredulous assertions pertaining to global terrorism and political regimes that have supported it.” The CPI parliamentarian added: “These statements are not only historically inaccurate, they are also deeply prejudiced and politically motivated…. As education minister of India and a constitutional representative, it is incumbent on you to ensure that the centres of knowledge are not used for such malignant agendas. “The decision on the course was passed without any discussions involving faculty members. Given the divisive nature of content and serious ramifications of such inaccurate information, I appeal to you to immediately intervene in this matter and ensure that the university undertakes a comprehensive review of this course.” Sircar, the Trinamul MP, alleged that the purpose of the course was to “provoke” those who uphold the values of the republic. “There is competition within the pro-BJP groups on campus to show who is more aggressive. It is a ruse to grab attention. It has been this way since M. Jagadesh Kumar became vice-chancellor (of JNU in 2016), and he has gotten away with it,” he told The Telegraph. Sircar added: “Nobody is saying there is no Islamist terrorism, the worst of which is seen in two of our neighbours…. The counter-terrorism course at Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School, Mizoram, explains a whole array of such threats to the republic. To bracket them all under one religion is meant to provoke those among us who uphold the values of the republic.” Bahujan Samaj Party MP Danish Ali told this newspaper: “This is unacceptable in a democracy like India which upholds secular values — values that JNU stood for…. Under the current VC, JNU has been in the news for the wrong reasons…. The new course is just to demonise a particular community.” The JNU administration has not responded to queries from this correspondent on the new course. It had backtracked on introducing “Islamic terrorism” as an area of study in 2018 after a notice from the Delhi Minorities Commission. CPM Rajya Sabha leader Elamaram Kareem said: “By introducing this particular course with such malignant content, the political motive of the present JNU administration is being uncovered. This is a part of the larger plan of the Sangh parivar to rewrite history with blatant lies and cooked up stories. “Here they are trying to spread the narrative that terrorism is equal to Islam and are trying to give theoretical back-up for their propaganda. The roots of terrorism are not in any religion, but in the plans of imperialism to destabilise the socialist and third world alternatives.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-253
01-09-2021||India||Olympians earn medals, Modi basks in glory ||None can accuse Narendra Modi of being slow off the blocks when it comes to spotting a propaganda opportunity. The Olympics and the Paralympics seem to have handed the Prime Minister another diversionary opportunity to sprint, jump and swim across the economic, health and freedom-curbing cesspool that his government stands accused of creating. Modi has been effusive in his praise for the Indian contingents’ achievements in the Olympics and now the Paralympics in Tokyo, making incessant social media posts, speaking to sportspersons who have won medals and calling them over to his residence for a felicitation. None can find fault with such encouraging gestures of the Prime Minister in a country where sports other than cricket have often been ignored. However, the optics of Modi’s overtures, with his telephone conversations with Olympic achievers being videographed and shared widely on social media, the elaborate multi-camera coverage of his in-person interactions with sportspersons, his pep talks to them and his breathless tweets have sparked speculation whether the politician is trying to appropriate the sporting achievements for political gains. “Soaring higher and higher!” Modi tweeted on Tuesday to congratulate Mariyappan Thangavelu for winning the silver medal in high jump at the Tokyo Paralympics. “Mariyappan Thangavelu is synonymous with consistence and excellence,” he waxed eloquent. “Congratulations to him for winning the Silver Medal. India is proud of his feat.” Similar fulsome praise for each achiever has filled Modi’s social media timelines. “The indomitable @sharad_kumar01 has brought smiles on the faces of every Indian by winning the Bronze Medal! His life journey will motivate many,” he tweeted about Sharad Kumar who bagged bronze in the same high jump event. Modi had been eloquent while congratulating Indian sportspersons’ feats at the Olympics too, while many in the BJP have suggested that the country’s haul of an unprecedented seven medals was another feather in the Prime Minister’s cap. While most sportspersons have lauded the Prime Minister’s effort to boost the morale of the players and generate a positive atmosphere for the promotion of sports in the country, the political motive behind the extraordinary and well-coordinated drive has either been papered over or deliberately ignored. Internally, BJP managers acknowledged that the good show by sportspersons at the Olympics and the Paralympics had helped the government to drown the criticism over the allegations of snooping using the Israeli sypware Pegasus, the steep rise in the prices of essential commodities, Covid mismanagement and relatively slow pace of vaccination. The ruling party insiders even appeared happy about the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, saying the development had come at an opportune moment and would blur the crises the Modi government was facing on multiple fronts. The rise of the extremist Taliban is being indirectly used by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath in his alleged polarising campaign for the Assembly elections next year. The underlying intention of basking in the reflected glory of sportspersons was evident at the well-planned event to felicitate the Olympic medal winners at the Prime Minister’s residence. The stage for the event had a large banner in which Modi’s picture dwarfed those of the winners, who had been relegated into a cluster. Multiple cameras followed every move of Modi from several angles and recorded his interactions as he treated sportspersons to their favourite dishes. Bemused social media users had assailed it as a public relations exercise and wondered who had won the medals, Modi or the sportspersons. Ministers and BJP leaders have also been going all out on social media platforms in their quest to project the sporting heroics as achievements of the Modi government. “That special moment when India’s Prime Minister calls to congratulate you…. Just after you’ve won the #Paralympics GOLD and broken the world record…. Well done Sumit Antil!” newly appointed information and broadcasting and sports minister Anurag Thakur tweeted on Monday.A video of javelin star Antil talking to Modi over the phone in the speaker mode was also uploaded. During the Olympics too, Modi’s calls to players in Tokyo had been elaborately videographed and shared widely on social media. The political intentions became even more stark when the Modi government renamed the country’s highest sporting honour, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award, to Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award, on the back of the men’s hockey team bagging an Olympics medal after four decades. Addressing an event in Uttar Pradesh, Modi linked the hockey bronze with two controversial events that have been the ideological cornerstones of his government — the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya and the scrapping of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status under Article 370.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-253
01-09-2021||India||Nine new Supreme Court judges sworn in by CJI Ramana||Nine new judges were sworn in to the Supreme Court on Tuesday by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana who administered the oath of office and secrecy at a solemn function held at the auditorium of the newly constructed additional building of the apex court. The nine judges sworn in according to their order of seniority are Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka, Justice Vikram Nath, Justice Jitendra Kumar Maheshwari, Justice Hima Kohli, Justice Bangalore Venkataramiah Nagarathna, Justice Chudalayil Thevan Ravikumar, Justice M.M. Sundresh, Justice Bela Madhurya Trivedi and Justice Pamidighantam S. Narsimha. With this the total strength of the Supreme Court has risen to 33 as against the sanctioned strength of 34 judges. This is the first time in the history of the Supreme Court when nine judges were sworn in at one go. It is also the first occasion when the event was held in an auditorium instead of the CJI’s court due to the pandemic.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-254
01-09-2021||India||Delhi University plans to raise fees amid pandemic||Delhi University will focus on increasing internal resources through revision of fees, creating endowment funds with the help of corporates and engaging with alumni for donation and various activities. The university in its proposed tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the education ministry and University Grants Commission (UGC) will make these commitments as part of the government’s push to all central universities for taking efforts to reduce dependency on public funding. “The university shall endeavour to continue to charge and revise fees for its various courses and facilities, keeping in view the need to make quality education accessible to all. Additionally, efforts will be made to augment the financial resources from other sources such as through endowments, and a one-time grant from public private organisations/individuals,” a provision in the MoU said. All the central universities are signing these types of agreements since 2019. However, the increase in fees has largely remained muted so far because of the outbreak of Covid in early 2020. This year, the commitment for increasing fees has come a shocker to several faculty members and students because of job losses and salary cuts owing to the economic crisis that got aggravated by Covid-induced restrictions. Abha Dev Habib, a faculty member of Miranda House College, said that the fees as such in DU colleges are very high. The fees may have a small component of tuition fee but it ranges between Rs 5,000 and Rs 42,000 in a year. St Stephen’s College charges Rs 42,000 annually, which includes charges for building, furniture, IT and similar facilities. “The parents are more stressed this year. Many have lost jobs and those in the private sector have faced salary cuts. The commitment to fee revision will add to the stress of students,” Habib said. Last year, hundreds of students of different DU colleges failed to pay their fees. Students of different colleges like St Stephen’s, Lady Shri Ram College (LSR) and Hindu College started fund-raising campaigns to help their needy peers. The effort became popular as many alumni and philanthropists came forward to support through money or in terms of gadgets for online education. A DU official said that the UGC keeps sending letters asking to augment funds and cut spending on different heads. “The UGC keeps monitoring the implementation of the tripartite agreement. For the last two years, Covid has created hurdles in implementation. The government also ranks universities based on how much they could keep to their commitments. So there is pressure to implement the commitment,” the official said. The National Education Policy (NEP) too has emphasised on raising funds by institutions. “The public universities provide education to all types of students. A majority of them are from economically and socially deprived sections. Any change in funding pattern will harm their interest,” Habib said. An email sent to DU vice-chancellor P.C. Joshi to get his comments on giving such commitment on revision of fees received no response.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-254
01-09-2021||India||With severe Covid, jabs falter, says AIIMS study||Full vaccination significantly reduces the risk of severe Covid-19, but if inoculated people develop oxygen deprivation or respiratory distress, their odds of critical illness or death are similar to those of unvaccinated people, a real-world vaccine effectiveness study in India has suggested. The study at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, has indicated that the few vaccinated people who develop severe disease due to either old age or underlying chronic health disorders have a similar risk of death as unvaccinated persons. The results, in line with earlier findings, show that full vaccination protects patients from oxygen deprivation or severe inflammation, needing steroids, requiring respiratory support, or dying from Covid-19 and underlines the need to expedite two full doses. India’s vaccination campaign, since its start on January 16, has administered more than 650 million doses up to Tuesday, but only around 150 million people (16 per cent) of the estimated 943 million adults have been fully vaccinated. The AIIMS doctors who tracked 1,464 unvaccinated, 231 partially vaccinated and 53 fully vaccinated Covid-19 patients admitted between April and June this year noted severe illness at admission in 48 per cent of unvaccinated, 40 per cent of partially vaccinated and 13 per cent of fully vaccinated. Among subsets of patients, 61 per cent unvaccinated and 54 per cent partially vaccinated required respiratory support compared with 18 per cent of fully vaccinated. About 22 per cent of unvaccinated and 19 per cent partially vaccinated died, compared with 5.7 per cent of fully vaccinated. Larger proportions of unvaccinated and partially vaccinated patients also had showed signatures of hyper-inflammatory responses compared with fully vaccinated patients, indicating that vaccination also reduces the risk of Covid-19-linked inflammatory responses. But once a patient developed hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation, or acute respiratory distress syndrome, the odds of developing critical illness and death were similar to those of unvaccinated individuals, the AIIMS doctors said in their study. The findings are consistent with a multi-hospital study in the US in June this year that had found that if hospital treatment is required in fully vaccinated patients, elderly patients with significant underlying health disorders remain at high risk for severe outcomes regardless of vaccination status. “Vaccinated people are protected from severe disease, but it is not 100 per cent,” said Randeep Guleria, the AIIMS director. “If a few of them go on to develop severe disease, they may have a bad outcome. Other factors also contribute to the disease severity.” The results show that two doses of vaccines protect patients from developing oxygen deprivation or severe inflammation, requiring ventilator support, or dying from Covid-19, in line with other studies underlining the benefits of full immunisation with two shots. At least two other studies — one by Max Hospital doctors, the other by Sir Ganga Ram Hospital doctors — have over the past month highlighted the need to expedite two doses. The current vaccination policy recommends a 12-week gap between the first and second dose of Covishield, one of the two primary vaccines currently used in India’s campaign. Sections of public health experts and doctors want the dose shortened.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-254
01-09-2021||India||Mulayam Singh Yadav ‘invites’ UP BJP chief to join Samajwadi Party||Mulayam Singh Yadav has invited Uttar Pradesh BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh to join the Samajwadi Party, according to a tweet by Manish Jagan Agrawal, digital media coordinator of the SP. Agrawal’s tweet was re-tweeted by Samajwadi chief Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday. Singh had met the Samajwadi patron at his residence in Lucknow on Monday and then tweeted in Hindi with a picture holding the left hand of Mulayam: “I met respected Mulayam Singh Yadav ji ‘Netaji’ at his residence to know his well-being and take his blessings. I wish for his good health and long life.” Initially, observers had considered it as a courtesy call as Mulayam enjoys good relations with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mulayam had blessed Modi to become Prime Minister again in 2019. Although Akhilesh had lost the Assembly elections in 2017, both he and his father Mulayam were present on the dais with Modi and Yogi Adityanath at the latter’s oath-taking ceremony on March 19 (2017). Agrawal tweeted on Monday night: “The BJP’s state president Swatantra Dev Singh met respected Netaji today. Netaji has offered Swatantra Dev Singh to join the Samajwadi Party. Swatantra Dev Singh is unhappy as the BJP is neglecting the backward castes and Dalits. May be that Swatantra Dev Singh dubs it a courtesy call but there is something in it.” However, Singh ridiculed Akhilesh for the tweet and said that the SP boss was desperately trying every trick for power. “Mulayam is a senior leader of the state and I met him because he is unwell,” Singh said. A Samajwadi source said: “Singh had invited Mulayam to attend the last rites of former chief minister Kalyan Singh and the SP patron had informed the BJP state president that he was unwell and wouldn’t be able to be present. In fact this decision was taken by Akhilesh that the SP would stay away from Kalyan’s last rites. We want to send a clear message among the minority community that we don’t admire Kalyan, during whose tenure as chief minister, Babri Masjid was demolished in Ayodhya in 1992.” Kalyan and other BJP leaders had claimed that Babri Masjid was built by Mughal emperor Babar in the 16th century after razing a Ram temple. A Ram temple is under construction at the same site on the order of the Supreme Court. BJP leaders had dubbed Kalyan as the “hero of Ram temple” after his death last week. Reacting on the tweets, senior Congress leader Dwijendra Tripathi said: “Mulayam as chief minister had ordered the police to open fire on kar sevaks of the BJP-Vishwa Hindu Parishad. Singh and all other BJP leaders call Mulayam a killer of kar sevaks. And now Singh meets Mulayam to know his well-being. How long will they cheat the voters by dividing them as Hindus and Muslims?” Making fun of the entire incident, an user Ranjan Kumar Singh tweeted with some pictures of Adityanath with Mulayam and Akhilesh: “Yogiji is unhappy with the BJP. May be he would join the SP tomorrow or day after.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-254
01-09-2021||India||Kashmir: Farooq says party ready to  participate in Assembly elections||National Conference president Farooq Abdullah on Tuesday appeared ready to participate in the proposed Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir predicting a victory for NC and making bureaucracy accountable for their actions, in what is being seen as the most firm indication that his party was readying for the polls. “We will win. I want to tell you, with full confidence, that if there is a fair election, National Conference will be the biggest party,” Farooq told reporters in Srinagar after a specific query on whether his party will contest the proposed elections. The elections are yet to be announced and while the Centre favours elections before restoration of statehood, the Valley parties have been calling for statehood before polls. The NC too had previously favoured the restoration of statehood to be followed by Assembly elections but Farooq on Tuesday chose not to delve into the issue. Asked if officers will take calls of the people since he was indicating a change in government, Farooq issued a warning to the bureaucracy of action, as if his party was just a stone’s throw from power. “They (bureaucrats) will not only pick up phones but they will be held accountable tomorrow about what they have done. They think of themselves as kings today. They are not kings, they are servants of people. They have to work for people,” he said, referring to the growing complaints that officers, who are mostly outsiders, refuse to even take calls of the people. An NC leader said his party continues to favour restoration of statehood before holding Assembly elections but said only the top brass can tell if there was any change in its stance. Farooq was not available for comment. Farooq heads the six-party alliance fighting for restoration of Article 370. When the alliance was floated in 2019, it had clearly stated that restoration of Article 370 was its utmost priority and that all their political activities would be “subservient to the sacred goal of reverting to the status of J&K as it existed on 4th August, 2019”. The NC chief’s comments came on the sidelines of the first-ever parliamentary outreach programme for Jammu and Kashmir panchayat bodies presided over by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, where Farooq and lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha sparred over a host of issues. Farooq said if they were with the country, the country should also take care of them. He said India was a diverse nation and no single religion can build the nation. “There is nothing common between those who live in Chennai or Srinagar but the binding factor was that we came together to create this country. India is a diverse nation and it cannot prosper if we don’t protect its diversity,” he said. “India cannot be run on the basis of one religion. There is more threat from the enemy within. We know about the enemy which is outside.” The former chief minister regretted that his party didn’t participate in the panchayat elections in 2018. The Valley parties had boycotted the rural polls to oppose the scrapping of special status. Their absence helped the BJP win many seats. Farooq said militancy still exists and the government should not live in “cuckoo world and think everything is hunky-dory”, urging the government to provide security to panchayat workers. Sinha, during his speech, claimed that every penny was accounted for under the new dispensation and “no one can usurp public funds like they did earlier”, in an apparent reference to the claims of Farooq that the present government was not accountable.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-254
01-09-2021||India||Scholar predicts India's shift into ethnic democracy under Modi||A French scholar who has studied Narendra Modi’s politics and policies over the past 20 years has just published a 639-page book on the Prime Minister in which he predicts that India’s transformation into an ethnic democracy, “where minorities are second class citizens”, and authoritarianism risks reaching a “point of no return”. Modi’s India: Hindu Nationalism and the Rise of Ethnic Democracy by Christophe Jaffrelot, professor of politics and sociology at King’s College London, has been translated from French by Cynthia Schoch and published by Princeton University Press. The author explained how he sees the model of democracy in India in an interview: “Democracy, nowadays, is a notion you need to qualify when applied to India. You may say, like some scholars do, that it is an ‘illiberal democracy’. “I prefer to use the concept of ‘ethnic democracy’ that has been first used in the case of Israel. An ‘ethnic democracy’ is a regime where pillars of democracy are still practised, including elections — something populists across the globe need to retain to acquire legitimacy — but where minorities are second class citizens because of all kinds of discrimination. “You may (also) use the word ‘majoritarianism’, which designates the attempt for transforming a cultural majority into a permanent, political majority”. Jaffrelot predicted that “changes under Modi may be permanent if the Hindutva forces have not only captured power, but also society — at least temporarily — and if this hegemonic position allows them to get deeply entrenched in the State apparatus, then a point of no return will be reached”. “This book has tried to make sense of the political trajectory of India from populism to ethnic democracy and authoritarianism under Narendra Modi, a journey of less than ten years,” writes Jaffrelot. The drift of the book is apparent in the headings given to chapters and sections: Hindu Nationalism: A Different Idea of India; Hindutva: What It Means to Be a Hindu; Modi in Gujarat: The Making of a National-Populist Hero; Targeting Minorities; Anti-Christian Xenophobia; Recurrent Mobilisations against Muslims; The Slow Death of the Right to Information; and What Fourth Estate? Among Indian scholars, his book has been called “the most comprehensive account to date of Narendra Modi’s capture and consolidation of power” by Partha Chatterjee of Columbia University, while Patrick Heller said “Modi’s India is quite simply the most detailed, theoretically sophisticated and comprehensive analysis of the rise of Modi’s BJP as a dominant electoral force”. Jaffrelot wears a number of other hats. He is based in Paris where he was elected president of the French Political Science Association last year and is a permanent consultant with the policy planning staff of the French foreign ministry. He is director of research at CERI-Sciences Po/CNRS and a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace. His books include The Pakistan Paradox, Hindu Nationalism: A Reader and a biography of B.R. Ambedkar. In the conclusion of Modi’s India, the author cites political scientist Suhas Palshikar: “In 2019, Suhas Palshikar concluded his contribution to Majoritarian State by considering that ‘electoral defeat alone can puncture the BJP’s resolute march towards crafting a new hegemony’, but electoral defeat may not make much of a difference, or, to be more precise, while it is a necessary condition, it may not be a sufficient one. “First, the Sangh Parivar is so deeply entrenched in the social fabric that it may continue to dictate its terms to the State on the ground — and to rule in the street. Second, the ‘deep state’ may remain in a position to influence policies and politics even if the BJP is voted out. In that sense, Hindu nationalism does not rely as much on one man to push its agenda as the BJP does to win elections.” Jaffrelot said he had “interviewed hundreds of people in the 20-years-long research that I have devoted to Narendra Modi’s politics in Gujarat and at the Centre”. In 2014 he decided to study whether Modi would use the five pillars of his “Gujarat model” as Prime Minister of India. “I continued to visit Ahmedabad once a year and other cities as well, including Delhi and Mumbai, but also Lucknow where the Hindu nationalist forces were adapting the Gujarat model to the local conditions of UP,” he said. Referring to “elitism and authoritarianism”, he said: “I show that the rise to power of the BJP has translated into a comeback of upper caste politicians, a dilution of reservations, and pro-rich policies in terms of taxation among other things…. I distinguish two modalities of authoritarianism, which are not mutually exclusive. “The first one pertains to vigilantism and consists in enforcing social and religious norms by resorting to physical threats and intimidation. Several components of the Sangh Parivar, including the Bajrang Dal, are in charge of such activities. “The second one relies on State institutions — such as the police — which are implementing governmental will — at the state level or at the federal level. In my book, I try to demonstrate that both are two sides of the same coin — partly because of the emergence of a kind of deep state.” Jaffrelot said he was introduced to Indian philosophies at 18, has long taken an interest in Hinduism, Buddhism and Sufism, did his PhD on Hindu nationalism, and has been to India at least twice a year since his first visit in 1984. Among politicians, he has interviewed Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani, Kanshi Ram, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Nanaji Deshmukh and Madhu Limaye. His view of the Fourth Estate is that “the mainstream media is losing its independence for all kinds of reasons, including the ads policy of the government, intimidation due to income tax and Enforcement Directorate raids, concentration of media outlets in the hands of businessmen who need the government’s support or are close to the rulers — not to say anything about the lack of courage of many newsmen who are easily co-opted by the regime”. He said that “the Election Commission has lost some of its independence”. As for the Supreme Court, “under four different chief justices it abstained from opposing the government for all kinds of reason, ranging from the fact that some of its members had been blackmailed, shared ideological affinities with the regime or anticipated post-retirements sinecures”. Jaffrelot hopes to visit India to debate and discuss the ideas in his book. “If academic works relying on years of empirical research could not be discussed any more in India, the very notion of democracy would be in question.” He has no idea how the Modi government will react to the book. “No government likes its work to be examined because all governments paint rosy pictures of their achievements. The question is how far will they engage with scholars who analyse their policies and strategies. It’s a test of freedom of expression.”||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-254
01-09-2021||India||Attendance remains poor even as schools reopen in several states||Several states have reopened schools, some only for the higher classes, and many others like Delhi are poised to do so from September. Reports, however, say that attendance has so far been poor in several states that have resumed physical classes after nearly 18 months of closure, with many parents reluctant to send their children to school because of the pandemic situation. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Monday issued guidelines allowing the reopening of schools for Classes IX, X, XI and XII in the capital from September 1. But it restricted the attendance in classrooms to 50 per cent and said a formal consent from the parents was a must. Authorities at a private Delhi school suggested that attendance was not expected to go over 50 per cent anyway, given the parental reluctance seen elsewhere, but if required they might hold classes in two shifts. Members of two parents’ groups of 40-odd members each whose children study in two different private schools in Delhi told The Telegraph their groups had collectively decided not to send their children to school for now, at least for theory classes. The parents, who declined to be named, said their children would continue with the online classes, which the schools will not be stopping even after resuming in-person classes. Bihar reopened schools for students of all classes a fortnight ago while Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand have done so for Class VI upwards. Odisha and Haryana have resumed Classes IX to XII. Uttar Pradesh will restart primary classes from September 1. Bengal will consider reopening schools only after the Pujas, chief minister Mamata Banerjee has said. Attendance in Uttar Pradesh has been 20 to 30 per cent on average since the reopening a week ago, reports say, especially with the government continuing to send dry rations to the children’s homes instead of serving cooked midday meals at school. A parent from Meerut said attendance was around 15 per cent at the budget school where his child was enrolled. Reports from Bihar suggest that social distancing is not being followed rigorously in the classroom. Anita Rampal, former dean of the faculty of education at Delhi University, said governments should reopen schools in rural areas and district towns that are experiencing minimal Covid spread instead of waiting for a uniform decision for the entire state. She said the big challenge for the schoolteachers now was to help the students make up the learning deficit caused by the long school closure. “Students from the poor and socially disadvantaged sections have been pushed to the margins (during the closure). They need more support, empathy and encouragement to pick up from where they are now, and gain the confidence to learn,” she said. Rampal said the schools must not hold exams or assessments now or threaten the children with “judgemental labels”. “The children need to sit and work in groups, while observing Covid protocols, so that they gain motivation and confidence from each other,” Rampal said. She also stressed the importance of ensuring immediate repairs and maintenance of schools’ infrastructure, which have suffered greatly during the long closure. Pritish Acharya, professor of social science and humanities at the Regional Institute of Education, Bhubaneswar, argued for the resumption of junior classes, saying most first-generation learners depend entirely on the schools for their foundational learning. “The primary school children (from poor families) have been the biggest losers because many are unable to handle the electronic device, or their parents are unable to help them, or they lack learning space at home,” he said. “Nor is the online mode the preferred form of imparting the foundational learning of alphabets, etc.” Mitra Ranjan, coordinator of the NGO Right to Education Forum, said many children from disadvantaged sections may not even have masks. “The schools should be supported with the necessary material to ensure students from all sections follow Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Ranjan said.

If they fail to pay the fine, they will have to undergo imprisonment for one more year. Retired Lt Col Rakesh Rana in association with builder Purna Chandra Panda had launched a scheme in Bhubaneswar in 2011-12 in the name of “Defence Intercity Vatika Association” and collected huge amounts of money from defence personnel with the assurance of providing them plots. The duo had assured to provide residential plots to serving and retired defence personnel only. In order to gain the confidence of the defence personnel, Rana had also floated an organisation named Sainik Welfare Organisation-India (SWO-India). An official of the economic offence wing of the Odisha crime branch on Tuesday said: “One Patitapabana Biswal had registered case against Lt Col Rakesh Rana (retired), chairman of Sainik Welfare Organisation-India and Purna Chandra Panda, managing director of Brookson Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd, and others for cheating by not providing them with plots. They had also defaulted in refunding the deposit amount received from the complainant and others, who had booked plots in the ‘Defence Intercity Vatika Project’.” They collected the money from the intending buyers between 2011-12 and 2014-15 but never gave plots to them. “The SWO-India, collected about Rs 31.57 crore from 542 numbers of defence personnel towards cost of land, development charges and registration fees, etc. Moreover, the SWO-India represented though its chairman, Rakesh Rana, during August 2011 entered into an agreement with accused, Purna Chandra Panda, managing director of M/s Brookson Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd to purchase land for the above project,” said a media release issued by the economic offence wing. However, the accused persons (Rana and Panda) in a criminal conspiracy hatched between themselves and others did not purchase adequate land to provide the same to the intending buyers as assured to them. They did not provide any land to the investors and misappropriated the entire amount collected from them, the release added. “After completion of investigation of the case, a charge-sheet was submitted against the accused. The case was heard in the court of presiding officer, designated court under OPID (Odisha Protection of Interest of Depositors) Act, Cuttack, and the court convicted the accused persons,” an official said.||https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/page-254
